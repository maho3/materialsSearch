Using the electronic five-orbital Hubbard model first-principles techniques to calculate the electronic hopping amplitudes between irons, and the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation to handle the many-body effects, here it is shown that the exotic block-AFM state is indeed stable at realistic electronic densities close to n similar to 6.0. Another state with parallel spins along the rungs and antiparallel along the legs of the ladders (the \"CX\" state) is close in energy. This state becomes stable in other portions of the phase diagrams, such as with hole doping, as also found experimentally via neutron scattering applied to KFe2Se3. In addition, the present study unveils other competing magnetic phases that could be experimentally stabilized by varying either n chemically or the electronic bandwidth by pressure. Similar results were obtained using two-orbital models, studied here via Lanczos and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. A comparison of the results obtained with the realistic selenides hopping amplitudes for BaFe2Se3 against those found using the hopping amplitudes for pnictides reveals several qualitative similarities, particularly at intermediate and large Hubbard couplings.

The fluorescence of the water-soluble QDs can be quenched only by Cu2+ and Fe3+ in physiological buffer solution.

Adding F- to form the colorless complex FeF63- can eliminate the interference of Fe3+. The detection limit Of Cu2+ ions was 10 nM. The results can be explained in terms of strong binding of Cu2+ onto the surface of CdSe resulting in a chemical displacement of Cd2+ ions and the formation of CuSe on the surface of the QDs.

Main structural features are almost regular GeSe4-, but distorted CuSe4- or AgSe4-tetrahedra sharing corners or edges. Eight selenium atoms coordinate the alkaline earth atoms in the voids of these three dimensional tetrahedral networks. Chemical bonding and the electronic structure are elucidated by self-consistent band structure calculations and the COHP method. The electron density and the electron localization function ELF of SrCu2GeSe4 reveal a significant stronger covalent character for the Ge-Se bonds compared with the Cu-Se bonds.

The solid-state reactions observed during the selenisation of three different types of precursors are presented. The first type of precursors (I) consists of the nanocrystalline phases Cu2-xSe and InSe at room temperature, which react to CuInSe2 starting at 470 K. The second type of precursor (II) shows an inhibited CuInSe2 formation out of the initial phases Cu2-xSe and gamma-In2Se3 starting at 400 K. The third precursor type (III) shows completely different selenisation behaviour. Starting from the intermetallic compound Cul(11)In(9) and amorphous selenium, the formation of the binary selenides In4Se3 and CuSe is observed after the melting point of selenium at 494 K. After selenium transfer reactions, the compound semiconductor CuInSe2 is formed out of Cu2-xSe and InSe.

The difference of solubility products (K-sp) of ZnSe and CuSe is the main driving force for the formation of these flower-like nanocomposites. The Cu content greatly influences the physical properties and photocatalytic activity of obtained CuSe-ZnSe nanocomposites. The as-produced CuSe-ZnSe nanocomposites show tremendous enhancements on the photocatalytic degradation ratio of organic dyes methylene orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. The 8 wt.% CuSe-ZnSe sample exhibits the highest degradation ratio for both MO (ca. 100%, 90 min) and MB (ca. 96%, 60 min), which are over 4 times and 2.5 times than that of the pure ZnSe sample, respectively. Based on the data of UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra, XPS and PL spectra, the enhancements of photocatalytic activities of CuSe-ZnSe flower-like nanocomposites are due to the effective separation of photo-electrons and holes induces by the direct initiates interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) from the valence band (VB) of ZnSe to CuSe, which results in the reduction of CuSe to Cu2Se. This work not only highlights the potential use of visible-light-driven CuSe-ZnSe flower-like nanocomposites photocatalysts, but also emphasizes the simple ion-exchange in situ growth method for the preparation of selenides heterogeneous structures.

Sorption-diffusion from acidified solutions proceeds more intensively: the concentrations of selenium and sulfur diffused from an acidified solution are about 5 times higher as compared with those obtained using a non acidified solution of the same concentration and at the same temperature. The concentration of sorbed selenopentathionate ions increases with increasing the temperature and concentration of K(2)SeS(4)O(6) solution and the duration of treatment. The SeS(4)O(6)(2-) anions diffused into polyamide gradually decompose, and the decomposition products-sulfate ions and SO(2)(-) are washed out from the polymer, but elemental selenium remains in it. Therefore, the polyamide films, depending on the degree of SeS(4)O(6)(2-) ion decomposition, change from colourless to yellow, brown or red. Copper sulfide and copper selenide layers are formed in the surface of polyamide film if the chalcogenized polymer is treated with a water solution of copper(II / I) salt: the anionic particles containing sulfur and selenium atoms of low oxidation state react with the copper ions. The conditions of polymer initial chalcogenation (the concentration and temperature of K(2)SeS(4)O(6) solution) determine the amount of copper and the composition of chalcogenide layer: the content of copper in the polyamide film increases with an increase of the concentration and temperature, and varies from 0.2 . 10(-2) to 33.5 . 10(-2) mg/cm(2). Results of X-ray structural analysis confirmed formation of mixed copper sulfide-copper selenide layers in polyamide surface.

The results show that CuInSe2 has chalcopyrite crystal structure and it remains stable below the temperature of 773 K, but it decomposes to CuSe and InSe at temperature above 773 K in vacuum annealing. While in oxygen annealing, CuInSe2 is oxidized to CuO, In2O3 and SeO2 at the temperature of 523 K. Therefore, the temperature of selenization or annealing must be lower than 773 K in order to reduce the amount of CuSe and InSe in large production scale.

Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X-ray methods. The dark red semiconductors crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space groups. SrCu2GeSe4 (Ama2, a = 10.807(4) Angstrom, b = 10.735(4) Angstrom, c = 6.541(2) Angstrom, Z = 4) forms a new structure type, whereas BaCu2GeSe4 (P3(1), a = 6.490(1) Angstrom, c = 16.355(3) Angstrom, Z = 3) and BaAg2GeSe4 (I222, a = 7.058(1) Angstrom, b = 7.263(1) Angstrom, c = 8.253(2) Angstrom, Z = 2) crystallize in structures known from thiostannates. Main structural features are almost regular GeSe4-, but distorted CuSe4- or AgSe4-tetrahedra sharing corners or edges. Eight selenium atoms coordinate the alkaline earth atoms in the voids of these three dimensional tetrahedral networks. Chemical bonding and the electronic structure are elucidated by self-consistent band structure calculations and the COHP method. The electron density and the electron localization function ELF of SrCu2GeSe4 reveal a significant stronger covalent character for the Ge-Se bonds compared with the Cu-Se bonds. For this reason the GeSe4 tetrahedra appear as quasi molecular entities, arranged spatially according to the motifs of closest packing. The metal atoms occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral voids of these \"tetrahedra packing\".

In this study barium was replaced with potassium, and mixed chalcogenides BaV(S,Se)(3) were stabilized at 3 GPa, in the temperature range 800-1000 degrees C. X-ray powder diffraction diagrams of the product from the high pressure synthesis have profiles which show strong strain broadening. The potassium rich samples swiftly absorbs water in humid air. Rietveld analysis and assumption of Vegard's law indicate that selenium can replace sulfur in all ratios, while potassium only partially replaces barium. The magnetic properties of the sulfides are very sensitive to sulfur content, the selenides are rather unsensitive with respect to anion number. Stoichiometric BaVS3 shows behavior similar to antiferromagnetism, but slight anion deficiency or potassium doping render them soft ferromagnets. Deviation from BaVS3 stoichiometry depresses the low to high resistivity transition temperature. Replacing S with Se increases the dimensionality of the compound.

All the obtained samples have the nickel arsenide-type hexagonal crystal structure, except CoTe (HP), and their estimated lattice parameters, a and c, show almost the same values within 0.8% in comparison between samples prepared by the QA method and those by the HP method. On the other hand, a distinct difference between samples prepared by QA and HP processes is found in the magnetization of NiSe and NiTe. In particular, for NiTe, the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates two transition temperatures at about 20 and 130 K in samples prepared by the HP process. However, samples of NiTex (x = 0.5, 0.66, 0.82, 1, 1.22, and 2) and NiTe containing Au prepared by QA process do not show similar magnetic orders in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K. Also, samples of NiSe (HP) show magnetic transition at similar to 20 K, while those of NiSe (QA) show a magnetic inflection point at similar to 10 K. To the best of our knowledge the remarkable difference in magnetic properties caused by the method of synthesis has not been reported. In this paper, we present comparative experimental results of magnetic, electric, and specific heat measurements of samples prepared by the two methods. A possible explanation for such a substantial difference in magnetic interaction will be discussed.

A transition to long-range antiferromagnetic order is found below T-N=8.5 K as identified by magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements, and the emergence of magnetic Bragg reflections with a propagation vector k=0. The low-field magnetic-susceptibility data indicate the presence of weak ferromagnetism in the antiferromagnetic ordered state which saturates in very small fields. Heat-capacity measurements at low temperatures indicate that only about half the configurational entropy is released at T-N.

The performance indicated significant superiority of CoSe 95422 to CoP 9301 in terms of germination (35.5 and 34.4 %), tillers (152 700 and 141 400/ha), cane length (204 and 201 cm) and cane diameter (2.32 and 2.25 cm) in autumn and spring season, respectively. CoSe 95422 exhibited significantly higher dry matter accumulation and leaf area index at all the growth stages during both the cropping seasons. Net assimilation rate increased substantially at the initial crop growth stages and declined thereafter. Genotype CoP 9301 achieved higher NAR (6.34 and 5.66 g/m(2)/day) during June-August, though it was failed to reach the level of significance during August-October. Number of millable canes exhibited marked variation among the genotypes in both the seasons. CoSe 95422 produced significantly highest cane yield during autumn (81.0 tonnes/ha) and spring season (73.2 tonnes/ha) respectively. The percentage increase in mean cane and sugar yield by autumn planted sugarcane over spring planted sugarcane was 9.7 and 11.27 %, respectively. However, maximum sugar yield was obtained by CoSe 95422.

For low extents of oxidation, alkali ions are removed exclusively to form K1-xNi2Se2. For greater extents of oxidation, the rate of the reaction decreases dramatically, concomitant with the extraction of both potassium and nickel to form K1-xNi2-ySe2. The appreciable mobility of transition metal ions is unexpected, but illustrates the relative energy scales of different defects in the ThCr2Si2 structure type. Furthermore, the fully oxidized compounds, K0.25Ni1.5Se2, spontaneously convert from the tetrahedral [NiSe4]-containing ThCr2Si2 structure to a vacancy-ordered NiAs structure with [NiSe6] octahedra, From analysis of the atom positions and kinetic data, we have determined that this transformation occurs by a continuous, low-energy pathway via subtle displacements of Ni atoms and buckling of the Se sublattice.

All the obtained samples have the nickel arsenide-type hexagonal crystal structure, except CoTe (HP), and their estimated lattice parameters, a and c, show almost the same values within 0.8% in comparison between samples prepared by the QA method and those by the HP method. On the other hand, a distinct difference between samples prepared by QA and HP processes is found in the magnetization of NiSe and NiTe. In particular, for NiTe, the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates two transition temperatures at about 20 and 130 K in samples prepared by the HP process. However, samples of NiTex (x = 0.5, 0.66, 0.82, 1, 1.22, and 2) and NiTe containing Au prepared by QA process do not show similar magnetic orders in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K. Also, samples of NiSe (HP) show magnetic transition at similar to 20 K, while those of NiSe (QA) show a magnetic inflection point at similar to 10 K. To the best of our knowledge the remarkable difference in magnetic properties caused by the method of synthesis has not been reported. In this paper, we present comparative experimental results of magnetic, electric, and specific heat measurements of samples prepared by the two methods. A possible explanation for such a substantial difference in magnetic interaction will be discussed.

Four zeolites representing three size classes of nanoporosity were used in this study to further elucidate the NISE phenomenon and describe its effects on the adsorption of Na, K, and Ca. Sodium and K ions have the same charge, but different ionic diameters. Sodium and Ca ions have similar ionic diameters, but different charges. Adsorption envelopes were created for these three cations on the four zeolites: zeolite Y, ZSM-5, ferrierite, and mordenite. Comparisons of the magnitudes of the adsorption of Na, K, and Ca on the four zeolites indicated that all cations adsorbed weakly on zeolite Y (large nanopores), Na and K adsorbed strongly on ZSM-5 and ferrierite (medium nanopores) while Ca adsorbed weakly, and all three cations adsorbed strongly on mordenite (small nanopores). It is noteworthy that in the medium nanopores, the two monovalent cations Na and K adsorbed more strongly than Ca, a divalent cation.

The thermoelectric power, S, of liquid Cu-Se alloys shows a p-n transition near the stoichiometric composition Cu2Se. The Ss obtained at 1373 K are 70 and 4 mu V/K for liquid CuSe and NiSe, respectively. The large values of sigma for liquid transition metal-Se alloys are related to the density of d-like states at the Fermi level due to the p-d hybridization. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. NiPdTe (Pnma, a = 8.337(2) b = 3.758(1), c = 6.290(1) angstrom, Z = 4) is build up by a distorted cubic closed packing of Te atoms with Ni atoms in one half of the tetrahedral holes. The Ni atoms form zigzag-chains with short Ni-Ni bonds. The Pd atoms are located in the octahedral holes and are fivefold coordinated by Te atoms due to a strong shift off the centers. The structure of NiPdTe is related to the TiNiSi type due to a similar nickel Substructure and to the Cu2Sb type with respect to the fcc packing of the anions. Ni2PdSe2 (I4/mmm, a = 10.446(1), c = 5.75(1) angstrom, Z = 8) forms a new structure type with strongly distorted edge- and corner-sharing NiSe4 tetrahedra. The Pd atoms are either planar coordinated by four Se or located in the centers of face-sharing Ni-8 cubes.

", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The management of sodic soils often involves the addition of Ca 2+ cations because it is believed that these divalent cations will easily desorb the Na + cations from the soil solid phase. However, the adsorption of cations in the interstitial region of minerals is counterintuitive, particularly if the diameter of the interstitial region is less than 1 nanometer. These very small dimensions are common in many soil minerals. Using zeolites, the ideal cation for treating sodic soils may be another monovalent cation, such as K +, rather than Ca 2+. The reasons for this reversal of selectivity in nanopore regions of minerals may be due to a NISE (nanopore inner-sphere enhancement) effect. An enhanced liquid-phase stability of the Na + ion in the presence of K + ions may also be involved.

I. Crystal structures and chemical bonding of AM(2)GeSe(4) (A = Sr, Ba; M = Cu, Ag)", "abstract": "Three new quaternary selenogermanates were synthesized by heating the elements at 983-1073 K. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X-ray methods. The dark red semiconductors crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space groups. SrCu2GeSe4 (Ama2, a = 10.807(4) Angstrom, b = 10.735(4) Angstrom, c = 6.541(2) Angstrom, Z = 4) forms a new structure type, whereas BaCu2GeSe4 (P3(1), a = 6.490(1) Angstrom, c = 16.355(3) Angstrom, Z = 3) and BaAg2GeSe4 (I222, a = 7.058(1) Angstrom, b = 7.263(1) Angstrom, c = 8.253(2) Angstrom, Z = 2) crystallize in structures known from thiostannates. Main structural features are almost regular GeSe4-, but distorted CuSe4- or AgSe4-tetrahedra sharing corners or edges. Eight selenium atoms coordinate the alkaline earth atoms in the voids of these three dimensional tetrahedral networks. Chemical bonding and the electronic structure are elucidated by self-consistent band structure calculations and the COHP method. The electron density and the electron localization function ELF of SrCu2GeSe4 reveal a significant stronger covalent character for the Ge-Se bonds compared with the Cu-Se bonds. For this reason the GeSe4 tetrahedra appear as quasi molecular entities, arranged spatially according to the motifs of closest packing. The metal atoms occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral voids of these \"tetrahedra packing\". This concept allows to derive the structures of AM(2)GeSe(4)-compounds from simple binary structure types as Li3Bi or Ni2In.", "ISSN": "0044-2313", "pub": "ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANORGANISCHE UND ALLGEMEINE CHEMIE", "volume": "627", "authors": ["Tampier, M", "Johrendt, D"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3749(200103)627:3%3C312::AID-ZAAC312%3E3.0.CO;2-U/abstract;jsessionid=DE53F308F8802114FA92B45A1F5AD22B.f01t03", "issue": "3", "pages": "312-320"}]]}
