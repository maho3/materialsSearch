Using the electronic five-orbital Hubbard model first-principles techniques to calculate the electronic hopping amplitudes between irons, and the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation to handle the many-body effects, here it is shown that the exotic block-AFM state is indeed stable at realistic electronic densities close to n similar to 6.0. Another state with parallel spins along the rungs and antiparallel along the legs of the ladders (the \"CX\" state) is close in energy. This state becomes stable in other portions of the phase diagrams, such as with hole doping, as also found experimentally via neutron scattering applied to KFe2Se3. In addition, the present study unveils other competing magnetic phases that could be experimentally stabilized by varying either n chemically or the electronic bandwidth by pressure. Similar results were obtained using two-orbital models, studied here via Lanczos and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. A comparison of the results obtained with the realistic selenides hopping amplitudes for BaFe2Se3 against those found using the hopping amplitudes for pnictides reveals several qualitative similarities, particularly at intermediate and large Hubbard couplings.

Neutron diffraction experiments indicated the possibility of two possible spin structures (antiferromagnetically ordered \"plaquettes\" or \"zigzags\"), indistinguishable by neutron scattering. Using LSDA calculated exchange parameters we estimate Neel temperatures for both spin structures within the molecular field approximation and show tau(1) (plaquettes) spin configuration to be more favorable than tau(2) (zigzags).", "ISSN": "0021-3640", "pub": "JETP LETTERS", "volume": "95", "authors": ["Medvedev, MV", "Nekrasov, IA", "Sadovskii, MV"], "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134%2FS0021364012010092", "issue": "1", "pages": "33-37"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/s11467-014-0428-y", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11467-014-0428-y.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 2014", "title": "Electronic and magnetic structures of chain structured iron selenide compounds", "abstract": "Electronic and magnetic structures of iron selenide compounds Ce2O2FeSe2 (2212*) and BaFe2Se3 (123*) are studied by the first-principles calculations.

For low extents of oxidation, alkali ions are removed exclusively to form K1-xNi2Se2. For greater extents of oxidation, the rate of the reaction decreases dramatically, concomitant with the extraction of both potassium and nickel to form K1-xNi2-ySe2. The appreciable mobility of transition metal ions is unexpected, but illustrates the relative energy scales of different defects in the ThCr2Si2 structure type. Furthermore, the fully oxidized compounds, K0.25Ni1.5Se2, spontaneously convert from the tetrahedral [NiSe4]-containing ThCr2Si2 structure to a vacancy-ordered NiAs structure with [NiSe6] octahedra, From analysis of the atom positions and kinetic data, we have determined that this transformation occurs by a continuous, low-energy pathway via subtle displacements of Ni atoms and buckling of the Se sublattice.

All the obtained samples have the nickel arsenide-type hexagonal crystal structure, except CoTe (HP), and their estimated lattice parameters, a and c, show almost the same values within 0.8% in comparison between samples prepared by the QA method and those by the HP method. On the other hand, a distinct difference between samples prepared by QA and HP processes is found in the magnetization of NiSe and NiTe. In particular, for NiTe, the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates two transition temperatures at about 20 and 130 K in samples prepared by the HP process. However, samples of NiTex (x = 0.5, 0.66, 0.82, 1, 1.22, and 2) and NiTe containing Au prepared by QA process do not show similar magnetic orders in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K. Also, samples of NiSe (HP) show magnetic transition at similar to 20 K, while those of NiSe (QA) show a magnetic inflection point at similar to 10 K. To the best of our knowledge the remarkable difference in magnetic properties caused by the method of synthesis has not been reported. In this paper, we present comparative experimental results of magnetic, electric, and specific heat measurements of samples prepared by the two methods. A possible explanation for such a substantial difference in magnetic interaction will be discussed.

Four zeolites representing three size classes of nanoporosity were used in this study to further elucidate the NISE phenomenon and describe its effects on the adsorption of Na, K, and Ca. Sodium and K ions have the same charge, but different ionic diameters. Sodium and Ca ions have similar ionic diameters, but different charges. Adsorption envelopes were created for these three cations on the four zeolites: zeolite Y, ZSM-5, ferrierite, and mordenite. Comparisons of the magnitudes of the adsorption of Na, K, and Ca on the four zeolites indicated that all cations adsorbed weakly on zeolite Y (large nanopores), Na and K adsorbed strongly on ZSM-5 and ferrierite (medium nanopores) while Ca adsorbed weakly, and all three cations adsorbed strongly on mordenite (small nanopores). It is noteworthy that in the medium nanopores, the two monovalent cations Na and K adsorbed more strongly than Ca, a divalent cation. The NISE effect is responsible for the changes in the relative strength of each cation's adsorption.

The structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. NiPdTe (Pnma, a = 8.337(2) b = 3.758(1), c = 6.290(1) angstrom, Z = 4) is build up by a distorted cubic closed packing of Te atoms with Ni atoms in one half of the tetrahedral holes. The Ni atoms form zigzag-chains with short Ni-Ni bonds. The Pd atoms are located in the octahedral holes and are fivefold coordinated by Te atoms due to a strong shift off the centers. The structure of NiPdTe is related to the TiNiSi type due to a similar nickel Substructure and to the Cu2Sb type with respect to the fcc packing of the anions. Ni2PdSe2 (I4/mmm, a = 10.446(1), c = 5.75(1) angstrom, Z = 8) forms a new structure type with strongly distorted edge- and corner-sharing NiSe4 tetrahedra. The Pd atoms are either planar coordinated by four Se or located in the centers of face-sharing Ni-8 cubes.

However, the adsorption of cations in the interstitial region of minerals is counterintuitive, particularly if the diameter of the interstitial region is less than 1 nanometer. These very small dimensions are common in many soil minerals. Using zeolites, the ideal cation for treating sodic soils may be another monovalent cation, such as K +, rather than Ca 2+. The reasons for this reversal of selectivity in nanopore regions of minerals may be due to a NISE (nanopore inner-sphere enhancement) effect. An enhanced liquid-phase stability of the Na + ion in the presence of K + ions may also be involved.

The metallic compounds crystallize in a variant of the K2ZnO2 type (Ibam, Z = 4, Pd2CoSe2: a = 5.993(1), b = 10.493(2), c = 5.003(1) angstrom; Pd2FeSe2: a = 5.960(1), b = 10.576(2), c = 5.078(1) angstrom; Pd2CoTe2: a = 6.305(1), b = 11.100(2), c = 5.234(1) angstrom; Pd2NiTe2: a = 6.286(1), b = 11.194(2), c = 5.157(1) angstrom). One-dimensional (1)(infinity)[Mh(4/2)] tetrahedra chains with remarkably short M-M bonds run along [001], separated by [Pd-2] dumbbells with palladium in fivefold coordination of selenium or tellurium atoms. The structure may also be described as a filled variant of the SiS2 type. M atoms occupy (1)/(4) of the tetrahedral voids and the Pd atoms fill all octahedral voids in a distorted cpp motif of chalcogen atoms. Even though the Pd(2)MCh(2) Compounds are isotypic to K2ZnO2 from the crystallographic viewpoint, we find a different bonding situation with additional homo- and heteronuclear metal-metal bonds between the Pd and Co atoms. The electronic structures and topologies of the electron densities of Pd2CoSe2 and isotypic Na2CoSe2 are analyzed and compared by using Bader's AIM theory. Different values of topological charge transfer and electron density flatness indices uncover striking quantitative differences in the nature of chemical bonding between the metallic compound Pd2CoSe2 and nonmetallic Na2CoSe2.

All the obtained samples have the nickel arsenide-type hexagonal crystal structure, except CoTe (HP), and their estimated lattice parameters, a and c, show almost the same values within 0.8% in comparison between samples prepared by the QA method and those by the HP method. On the other hand, a distinct difference between samples prepared by QA and HP processes is found in the magnetization of NiSe and NiTe. In particular, for NiTe, the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates two transition temperatures at about 20 and 130 K in samples prepared by the HP process. However, samples of NiTex (x = 0.5, 0.66, 0.82, 1, 1.22, and 2) and NiTe containing Au prepared by QA process do not show similar magnetic orders in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K. Also, samples of NiSe (HP) show magnetic transition at similar to 20 K, while those of NiSe (QA) show a magnetic inflection point at similar to 10 K. To the best of our knowledge the remarkable difference in magnetic properties caused by the method of synthesis has not been reported. In this paper, we present comparative experimental results of magnetic, electric, and specific heat measurements of samples prepared by the two methods. A possible explanation for such a substantial difference in magnetic interaction will be discussed.

A transition to long-range antiferromagnetic order is found below T-N=8.5 K as identified by magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements, and the emergence of magnetic Bragg reflections with a propagation vector k=0. The low-field magnetic-susceptibility data indicate the presence of weak ferromagnetism in the antiferromagnetic ordered state which saturates in very small fields. Heat-capacity measurements at low temperatures indicate that only about half the configurational entropy is released at T-N.
