These oxides exhibit high electronic conductivity (approximate to 100 S cm(-1) at T = 700 degrees C) as well as high values of oxygen diffusion and surface exchange coefficients (D* and k, determined using SIMS analysis of the 180 isotope). The oxygen diffusion performances of Pr2NiO4+delta are the highest ones among those of the studied compounds. Interestingly, in the Nd-series they are slightly improved by the creation of Nd vacancies, while they are affected by the substitution of Nd by Ca. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Infrared reflectivity spectra on a crystal of this material between 30 and 20000 cm(-1) have been obtained from 77 K up to room temperature. The low-energy region (up to 1000 cm(-1)) can be interpreted as phonon spectra screened by a plasmon. Thermal evolution of the screening of phonons shows the semiconducting behavior of this material. Conductivity data obtained from Kramers-Kronig transformations for frequencies between 1000 and 16000 cm(-1) are fitted by a theory involving the simultaneous presence of large and small polarons. Due to expectations of relatively large effects of disorder and of Coulomb interactions on properties of large polarons, one contribution to the absorption, that for which the initial and final state is in the wide (large-polaron) band, is approximated as a Gaussian with adjustable center position and width. The other three contributions, involving at least one of the initial or final states in the narrow (small-polaron) band are treated by modifications of previously published theories for small concentrations of polarons. In all there are seven parameters in the theory. After preliminary fits in which each parameter is treated as adjustable at each temperature, the phonon energy was fixed at 0.064 eV, with the other parameters determined by fitting. The fits are approximately as good as the estimated accuracy of the conductivity data, and the fitted values occur in ranges expected from the theory. Values of parameters associated with small polarons imply a large contribution to binding energies from short-range forces. Combining results for parameters with the conductivity data of Allancon et al. enables estimates to be made of the approximate position of the mobility edge in the wide band and of orders of magnitude of concentrations of mobile carriers.

Ni2+ becomes three dimensionally (3D) antiferromagnetically ordered at T(N) almost-equal-to 325 K, with a propagation vector K = [100], and spins oriented along the a axis (parallel to the propagation vector). The magnetic structure belongs to the GAMMA-7g(- - +)-representation (g(x) mode, Shubnikov group B(p)mab') of Bmab, and a magnetic moment of 1.5 mu-B is measured at 155 K. This compound undergoes two different structural phase transitions. First, going down in temperature, Pr2NiO4 transforms by a first order phase transition from orthorhombic (Bmab) to tetragonal (P4(2)/ncm) at T(c1) almost-equal-to 115 K. At high temperature, we can predict a transformation from orthorhombic (Bmab) to tetragonal (I4/mmm) in a continuous way. The extrapolated temperature for this second structural transition is T(c2) almost-equal-to 1500 +/- 100 K. The low temperature structural transformation allows a change in the magnetic structure which for T < T(c1) is better described in the orthorhombic symmetry. Just below T(c1) the magnetic structure is described by the: GAMMA-3g (- +)-representation of P c c n (g(x)c(y)-closed-integral-z mode, Shubnikov group P c' c' n), this magnetic phase begins to disappear going down in temperature and at the same time a new magnetic phase grows. This new magnetic structure is described by the GAMMA-1g(+ +)-representation of P c c n (c(x)g(y)a(z) mode, Shubnikov group P c c n). Both magnetic structures coexist in a certain temperature range. At 1.5 K the c(x)g(y)a(z) mode represents the total of the magnetic ordering. To reproduce the observed magnetic intensities we are forced to consider that Pr3+ is polarized below 40 K, with a magnetic structure which is coupled to the Ni sublattices (i.e. GAMMA-1g and GAMMA-3g-representations).

It is considered that the doped Fe is partially substituted at the Ni position in Pr2NiO4.

The two-magnon spectrum is computed in a self-consistent manner within the framework of a renormalized harmonic approximation, which is correct up to order 1/S in the 1/S expansion of perturbation theory. Including a renormalization of the one-magnon spectral function due to the intrinsic spin part of the model up to order 1/S-2 and due to spin-phonon interaction up to order 1/S, it is shown that spin-phonon interaction generates a significant broadening of the one-magnon spectral function at the Brillouin-zone boundary in the regime where sound velocities are small compared to magnon velocities. In that regime it dominates the spectral feature of the two-magnon Raman line. Based on that result, the anomalous broadening of the two-magnon spectrum, observed in light-scattering experiments on antiferromagnets with large maximum magnon energies such as, e.g., the spin-1/2 compound La2CuO4 and the spin-1 compound Pr2NiO4, can be described mainly as a consequence of spin-phonon interaction. This effect is absent in systems with smaller exchange integrals such as, e.g., La2NiO4 or K2NiF4, respectively. Accordingly, it is safe to postulate that the broad spectral feature observed experimentally is generated by spin-phonon interaction. In order to explain the line shape in the cuprates completely, especially the high-energy tail, four-magnon contributions due to nearest-neighbors spin-pair excitations and higher contributions in the effective Raman-scattering Hamiltonian due to the resonant enhancement of the Raman cross section have to be considered and will be discussed on a qualitative basis.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "52", "authors": ["SAENGER, DU"], "issue": "2", "pages": "1025-1041"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0167-2738(94)90216-X", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727389490216X/pdf?md5=c7371fb1bd752eb9a07f9056452e117b&pid=1-s2.0-016727389490216X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 15 1994", "title": "INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN ON STRUCTURAL TRANSITIONS IN PR2NIO4+DELTA", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016727389490216X", "abstract": "We have investigated structural transitions in Pr2NiO4+delta (delta greater-than-or-equal-to0) using DSC, TGA and XRD measurements.

The transition temperature from P4(2)/ncm to Bmab is independent on delta in the small range of oxygen excess allowed.  Moreover, an orthorhombic-tetragonal transition at about 720 K in the oxidized Pr2NiO4+delta was emphasized and extensively discussed.  This transition occurs simultaneously with an oxygen loss.

In contrast to tetragonal La1.67Sr0.33NiO4, these crystals are orthorhombic. The corresponding distortion of the NiO2 planes is found to dictate the direction of the charge stripes, similar to the case of diagonal spin stripes in the insulating phase of La2-xSrxCuO4. In particular, diagonal stripes seem to always run along the short a axis, which is the direction of the octahedral tilt axis. In contrast, no influence of the crystal symmetry on the charge stripe ordering temperature itself was observed, with T-CO similar to 240 K for La, Pr, and Nd. The coupling between lattice and stripe degrees of freedom allows one to produce macroscopic samples with unidirectional stripe order. In samples with stoichiometric oxygen content and a hole concentration of exactly 1/3, charge stripes exhibit a staggered stacking order with a period of three NiO2 layers, previously only observed with electron microscopy in domains of mesoscopic dimensions. Remarkably, this stacking order starts to melt about 40 K below T-CO.

The composition Pr-2(Ni0.75Cu0.25)(0.95)Ga0.05O4+delta has a larger amount of interstitial oxygen O3 atoms (delta = 0.31 at room temperature (RT)) compared with Pr2Ni0.75Cu0.25O4+delta (delta = 0.19 at RT) and the oxygen deficient Sr2Ti0.9Co0.1O4-epsilon (epsilon = 0.02 at RT). The interstitial O3 atom is stabilized by (1) the substitution of (Ni,Cu)(2+) by higher valence Ga3+, (2) static atomic displacements' of the apical O2 oxygen, and (3) local relaxation near d(10) Ga3+. Nuclear-density distributions of Pr-2(Ni0.75Cu0.25)(0.95)Ga0.05O4+delta and Pr2Ni0.75Cu0.25O4+delta at high temperatures have visualized the -O2-O3-O2-diffusional pathway of oxide ions, which indicates an interstitialcy diffusion mechanism. Doping of the Jahn-Teller Cu2+ in Pr2NiO4+delta stabilizes the high-temperature disordered tetragonal I4/mmm phase and makes the apical O2 atoms more mobile. The apical O2 is more mobile compared to the equatorial O1, because the longer covalent (Ni,Cu,Ga)-O2 bond is weaker than the shorter (Ni,Cu,Ga)-(equatorial O1) one, as evidenced by the experimental and theoretical electron-density analysis. The interstitial O3 is more mobile due to the lower coordination number (CN = 4) compared with the lattice O1 and O2 atoms (CN = 6). It was found that the minimum nuclear density on the O2-O3 pathway rho(N)(T) is a useful microscopic parameter for the oxygen diffusivity. The rho(N)(T) is regarded as the oxygen probability density at the bottleneck for diffusion. The oxygen permeation rate rho(P)(T) increases with an increase of rho(N)(T). The activation energy for oxygen diffusion estimated by the plots of log (the normalized oxygen permeation rate rho(P)(T)/delta) against T-1 (reciprocal of absolute temperature) is relatively independent of temperature as well as the formation energy of oxygen atoms at the bottleneck from the plots of log(rho(N)(T)/delta) against T-1. These results indicate that the amount of interstitial oxygen delta is proportional to the carrier concentration for the oxide-ion diffusion. Doping of higher valence Ga3+ at (Ni,Cu)(2+) site in Pr2Ni0.75Cu0.\n\n25O(4+delta) does not change largely the activation energy for the oxygen permeation and formation energy of oxygen atoms at the bottleneck but increases the amount of excess interstitial oxygen (carrier concentration), which yields the high oxygen permeation rate of 262 mu mol min(-1) cm(-2) in Pr-2(Ni0.75Cu0.25)(0.95)Ga0.05O4.13 at 900 degrees C.

The stability of Pr2NiO4+delta in reducing atmospheres, estimated from the P(02) dependencies of total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, is lower than that of LaNiO4+delta, probably due to a smaller size of the A-site cation.

In air, the non-stoichiometry values vary in the relatively narrow ranges (2.4-4.2) x 10(-2) for La- and (0.01-2.0) x 10-2 for Pr-containing compositions, increasing with temperature. Due to the smaller size of praseodymium cations, Pr4Ni.7FeO.3010-6 exhibits a substantially lower thermodynamic stability in comparison with La4Ni2.7Fe0.3O10-delta and La4Ni3O10-delta, although the oxygen content in Pr4Ni2.7Fe0.3O10-delta lattice is higher. The partial substitution of iron for nickel has no essential effect on the low-p(O-2) stability limit corresponding to the transition of Pr4Ni3O10-delta into K2NiF4-type Pr2NiO4+delta. On the contrary, doping of La4Ni3O10-delta with iron decreases the oxygen vacancy concentration and shifts the phase stability boundary towards lower oxygen chemical potentials, suggesting a stabilization of the transition metal-oxygen octahedra in lanthanum nickelate lattice. The Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that the predominant state of iron cations, statistically distributed between the nickel sites, is trivalent. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The electronic localization is followed by a magnetic ground state consisting of an unusual antiferromagnetic structure, with k = (1/2 , 0, 1/2) relative to the orthorhombic crystal cell. This propagation vector implies the symmetrical coexistence of ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings along the three pseudocubic axes. This suggests the existence of a nonuniform orbital distribution of the single e(g) electron. The orbital superlattice may result from the breakdown of the degeneracy of the Ni(III)(t2g6e(g)1) state due to electronic correlation. This type of spin arrangement has not been observed in other perovskite oxides. These findings are confirmed by the magnetic behavior of the single crystallographic Nd site: half of these ions become ordered and the other half remain disordered as in a simple paramagnet.

The studies on dense cathodes allowed to determine their electrical conductivity characteristics independently of their microstructure. The performances of these cathode materials were measured using the complex impedance spectroscopy at various temperatures and oxygen partial pressures.

We find a significant difference in the character of the doped hole between the nickelates and cuprate. We observe that both strontium substitution and introduction of excess oxygen lead to a shift of the Ni absorption edge to higher energies, by nearly 3 eV in NaSrNiO4. This result demonstrates that the doped holes, in addition to the O 2p character, have a substantial amount of Ni 3d character (30-40 %).

Five different magnetic phase transitions have been identified and characterized.  A collinear antiferromagnetic ordering of Ni2+ magnetic moments exists between T(N1) almost-equal-to 320 K and T(C1) almost-equal-to 130 K (g(x) mode) where an orthorhombic-totetragonal (Bmab to P4(2)/ncm) structural phase transition occurs.  In this temperature range, the Nd3+ ions behave as a paramagnet being polarized by the effect of an internal magnetic field associated with the Ni-Nd antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction.  A weak ferromagnetic component appears below 130 K, which is consistent with the g(x)c(y)f(z) and g(x) + c(y)f(z) magnetic modes for Ni2+ proposed from a neutron-powder-diffraction experiment.  An additional out-of-plane component of the internal magnetic field on the Nd3+ ions develops with this structural phase transition and strongly polarizes these ions.  Two additional transitions are observed at T(c2) almost-equal-to 68 K (very prominent) and T(c3) almost-equal-to 45 K (very smooth), which are characterized by a sudden increase in the internal magnetic field acting on the Nd ions.  This internal magnetic field is evaluated and an antiparallel ordering between the Ni and Nd weak ferromagnetic spin components is inferred.  A field-induced transition has been identified.  A peak on both the differential susceptibility and the real part of the ac susceptibility at T(N2) almost-equal-to 11 K marks a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of the Nd3+ ions.  The out-of-plane component of the Ni2+ magnetic moments is attributed to the antisymmetric interaction D(Ni-Ni), which turns out to be quite important (D(Ni-Ni) almost-equal-to -16.0 meV) as compared to La2NiO4 and La2CuO4, probably because of a greater tilting angle of the octahedra.

Diffraction patterns of Nd2-xSrxNiO4+delta were indexed by a tetragonal symmetry except for that of Nd2NiO4+delta measured at 873 K in 1 bar O-2. Tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition was observed in Nd2NiO4+delta. The phase transition temperature decreases as P(O-2) decreases, e.g., about 883 K in P(O-2) = I bar and about 758 K in P(O-2)=10(-4) bar. Temperature vs. oxygen content phase diagram for Nd2NiO4+delta is illustrated from the relationship between phase transition temperature and oxygen content. Lattice parameters and atomic arrangement were estimated by the Rietveld analysis. As the amount of excess oxygen increases, the lattice parameter perpendicular to the perovskite and the rock salt layers increases and that parallel to the layers slightly decreases. As a consequence, the cell volume is almost independent of delta. The lattice parameters essentially depend on temperature and the amount of excess oxygen. Apparent thermal expansion coefficient was calculated from temperature dependence of lattice parameters in a constant atmosphere, while true thermal expansion coefficient was calculated from the temperature dependence of lattice parameters at the same oxygen content. Isothermal chemical expansion coefficient was calculated from the variation of the lattice constants with oxygen content. Thermal and chemical expansion coefficients are compared with expansion coefficients of other nonstoichiometric oxides. To make clear the correlation between oxygen nonstoichiometry and structural parameters' variation, space in the rock salt layer where interstitial oxygen is located is calculated from the structural information. Space in the rock salt layer decreases as the calculated acceptor concentration, x +2 delta, increases. This means that the interstitial oxygen formation is suppressed as the acceptor concentration increases. Similar tendency has been confirmed in oxygen nonstoichiometric behavior of Ni-based K2NiF4-type oxides. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The (b-a) value of the orthorhombic phase at delta=0.205-0.224 decreases with decreasing the delta value and is expected to become zero at delta=0.13. A Rietveld analysis of the phase at delta=0.106 shows that the phase consists of 90% of all orthorhombic phase and 10% of a tetragonal phase. The excess oxygen will be concerned for the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition of Nd2NiO4+delta.

The measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 873 to 1173 K and the P(O-2) range from 10(-20) to 1 bar. Nd2-xSrxNiO4+delta shows the oxygen excess and the oxygen composition depending on P(O-2), temperature, and the Sr content. To evaluate the characteristics of oxygen nonstoichiometric behavior, partial molar enthalpy of oxygen was calculated. The value of partial molar enthalpy of oxygen slightly approaches zero as delta increases in the oxygen excess region while that is independent of delta in the oxygen deficient region. Discussion was made by comparing data of this study with nonstoichiometric and thermodynamic data of La2-xSrxNiO4+delta: Nd2-xSrxNiO4+delta show more oxygen excess than La2-xSrxNiO4+delta in the higher P(O-2) region, while the nonstoichiornetric behavior in the oxygen deficient composition is almost the same. The variation of partial molar enthalpy of oxygen with delta for Nd2-xSrxNiO4+delta in the oxygen excess region is much smaller than that of La2-xSrxNiO4+delta. The oxygen nonstoichiometric behavior of Nd2-xSrxNiO4+delta is more ideal-solution-like than that of La2-xSrxNiO4+delta. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A sample is in the orthorhombic symmetry at delta > 0.15 and in the tetragonal one at delta <= 0.15. The orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition of La2-xNdxNiO4+delta is caused by the decrease of the delta-value due to the increase of temperature.

Because a length of a-axes of the orthorhombic phase decreases with increasing the delta-value, the orthorhombic phase is expected to be formed by a tilt of the NiO6 octahedra parallel to the a-axis induced by the interstitial oxygen.

Moreover, some anomalies in dc magnetic susceptibility curves was observed at 45, 95 and 130 K for delta < 0.077. These transitions are connected to the tetragonal phase, and were attributed, respectively, to an antiferromagnetic transition, possible charge ordering and structural transition.

The three-dimensional magnetic ordering of the Ni ions produces a small peak in the heat capacity at 325 K, indicating strong two-dimensional magnetic behavior. A sharp first-order peak has been found at 138 K corresponding to the structural transition from the low-temperature tetragonal P4(2)/ncm phase to the higher-temperature orthorhombic Bmab phase. No three-dimensional ordering of the Nd sublattice has been detected. The excess heat capacity, after subtracting the estimated lattice contribution, is in agreement with the crystal-field energy levels of the Nd3+ ions reported from inelastic neutron diffraction experiments. A broad shoulder below 10 K can be adscribed to an additional splitting of 17 K in the lowest crystal-field doublet of Nd3+. It is due to the interaction with the internal magnetic field created by a canting of the Ni2+ magnetic moments.", "ISSN": "0040-6031", "pub": "THERMOCHIMICA ACTA", "volume": "269", "authors": ["Castro, M", "Burriel, R"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "523-535"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/c4ta00665h", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "JUL 7 2014", "title": "High performance of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells using Nd2NiO4+delta-based composite cathodes", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2014/TA/c4ta00665h", "abstract": "\nNd2NiO4+delta infiltrated into porous yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is proposed in this work as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In order to obtain nickelate single phase, calcination times and temperatures of the salt precursors are studied. Anode supported microtubular cells using this cathode are fabricated and characterized, showing power densities of about 0.76 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and a voltage as high as 0.8 V. No degradation is detected after 24 hours under current load, assuring reasonable stability of the cell. Preliminary solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) results show slightly better performances in comparison with SOFC operation. It is believed that infiltration of nickelate salt precursors followed by calcination proposed in this work avoids high temperature sintering of the nickelate phase with the electrolyte and. as a consequence, prevents their reaction.

Nd2NiO4+delta powders were synthesized by Solid State Reaction, HMTA and Citrates. The samples observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy presented very different microstructures. Three characteristic processes were distinguished at high, medium and low frequency. High frequency contribution was attributed to oxygen ion transfer electrode/electrolyte. Medium frequency contribution was related to oxygen interstitial bulk diffusion and oxygen incorporation in those cases in which the surface of small particles is affected by chemical reactivity with the electrolyte. The low frequency contribution was attributed to dissociative adsorption for electrodes with small particle sizes and high porosity, and a co-limited process of adsorption and gas diffusion for an electrode with dense microstructure and low porosity.

The coupled influences of the powder grain size and the firing temperature have been investigated and optimised to yield a dense electrolyte at 1300 degrees C. Then anode-supported half-cells (electrolyte/anode), based on BIT07/BIT07-Ni have been prepared by tape casting and co-sintered. The composition and the microstructure of the cermet anode (BIT07 grain size, amount and nature of pore-forming agent) have been optimised to achieve an area surface resistance (ASR) value of about 0.15 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C under wet reducing atmosphere. The stability of the most performing anode has been followed during 500 h and the observed degradation seems to be due a loss of nickel percolation.

Although the simple structure and high transition temperatures make this family (general formula Sr-n+1CUnO2n+1+delta) of interest, the stringent synthesis conditions limit its value for applications. Here we report that fluorine insertion into Sr2CuO3 at ambient pressure causes related structural rearrangements to give superconducting Sr2CuO2F2+delta with a maximum T-c of 46 K. In this synthesis, the structural changes previously initiated by the thermodynamic effects of high pressure are induced chemically under ambient conditions.

We have explored the effects of an additional variable, the reaction pressure, and have thereby synthesized some new compounds, including (Ca1-ySry)1-xCuO2 which shows superconductivity at 110 K (refs 2, 3). Here we report the synthesis of a new family of high-pressure phases with the formula Srn+1CunO2n+1+delta (n = 1, 2, 3,...) extending from Sr2CuO3.1 (n = 1) to SrCuO2 (n = infinity)4. Sr2CuO3.1 and Sr3Cu2O5+delta' (n = 2) are superconductors with transition temperatures (T(c)) of 70 and 100 K, respectively. The metal sublattice of Sr2CuO3.1 is of the tetragonal K2NiF4 (or Nd2CuO4) type with lattice constants a = 3.764 angstrom and c = 12.548 angstrom, and iodometric measurements suggest that nearly half of the oxygen atoms are missing from the counter-layers to Sr2O1.1. Homogeneous pyramidal or octahedral coordination, which has generally been believed to be indispensable to attain T(c)s of approximately 100 K, is thus absent.

This anisotropy prefers ordering of rare-earth moments along [100] for R = Pr and Nd and along [001] for X = Sm. Combined with a pseudodipolar interaction arising from the anisotropy of the R-Cu exchange, we can explain the magnetic structures of these materials. The spin reorientation transitions in Nd2CuO4 can be explained in terms of a competition between various interplanar interactions which arises because of the rapid temperature dependence of the Nd moment below about 100 K. Finally we introduce a simple two-dimensional model for the Nd spin-wave spectrum. For zero wave vector, this model gives two optical modes involving Cu spins whose temperature-dependent energies agree with experimental results and an acoustic mode whose energy is predicted to be of order root 2k(4) Delta approximate to 5 mu eV, where k(4) is the fourfold in-plane anisotropy constant and Delta is the Nd doublet splitting.", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "56", "authors": ["Sachidanandam, R", "Yildirim, T", "Harris, AB", "Aharony, A", "EntinWohlman, O"], "issue": "1", "pages": "260-286"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.45.12548", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 1 1992", "title": "MAGNETIC ORDER, SPIN CORRELATIONS, AND SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN SINGLE-CRYSTAL ND1.85CE0.15CUO4+DELTA", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.45.12548", "abstract": "Measurements are reported of the static, instantaneous, and dynamic spin correlations in single crystals of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4+delta.

For Gd contents larger than a critical concentration x(cr)s = 0.625, marked by a discontinuity in the concentration dependence of the lattice parameters a and c, the sites of O(1) atoms in the CuO2 planes deviate from the symmetrical position in the T' structure. The deviations correspond to rotations of the O(1) squares around the central Cu sites. These distortions lower the local symmetry at Gd sites, which is orthorhombic for x > x(cr)s. However, x-ray-diffraction patterns show the global symmetry to be tetragonal for all compounds. The distortions provide an explanation for the magnetic properties of Gd-rich compounds, in particular for their weak ferromagnetism.

From the maximum in the amplitude of the microwave absorption, we have determined T0 = 295(3) K for R = Tb.  The values of T0 decrease monotonically along the series down to T0 = 260(3) K for R = Tm.  For R = Y we have measured T0 = 265(3).  The in-phase component of the ac magnetic susceptibility chi'(T) presents a peak whose shape and intensity are dependent on both the amplitude and the frequency of excitation of the magnetic field.  The simultaneous observation of a nonzero and also frequency-dependent out-of-phase term, chi\"(T), suggests the presence of relaxation phenomena.  The dc magnetization of Tb2CuO4, measured in magnetic fields up to 50 kOe, shows:  (i) a linear and reversible part associated with the polarization of the rare-earth ions by the applied magnetic field, (ii) a contribution M(Cu) related to the appearance of weak ferromagnetism and spin-glass-like features in the Cu lattice, and (iii) an effective internal field H(i) acting on the Tb ions, which is linearly dependent on M(Cu).  Both M(Cu) and H(i) present a strong dependence on the magnetothermal history of the samples, below a characteristic temperature T(irr)(H).

Just below T(c1) the magnetic structure is described by the: GAMMA-3g (- +)-representation of P c c n (g(x)c(y)-closed-integral-z mode, Shubnikov group P c' c' n), this magnetic phase begins to disappear going down in temperature and at the same time a new magnetic phase grows. This new magnetic structure is described by the GAMMA-1g(+ +)-representation of P c c n (c(x)g(y)a(z) mode, Shubnikov group P c c n). Both magnetic structures coexist in a certain temperature range. At 1.5 K the c(x)g(y)a(z) mode represents the total of the magnetic ordering. To reproduce the observed magnetic intensities we are forced to consider that Pr3+ is polarized below 40 K, with a magnetic structure which is coupled to the Ni sublattices (i.e. GAMMA-1g and GAMMA-3g-representations).

In addition to obtain high dielectric constant at room temperature and low frequencies, two frequency-dependent peaks in the tan delta curves and corresponding features in the real part dielectric constant epsilon' curves were observed near 118 K and 255 K for f = 100 Hz. The peak temperatures observed in the tan delta curves at various test frequency f follow the relation f = f(c)e(-W/kT), with f(c) = 3.1 x 10(13) (2.8 x 10(14)) Hz and the activation energy W = 0.282 (0.60) eV for the 118 K (255 K) peak for the sample annealed at 880 degrees C. The low temperature activation is attributed to the excitations from the ground state of I-4(9/2) multiplets to the first excited states of the I-4(11/2) multiplets. This assignment is further confirmed by the fact that the activation energy is reduced to 0.245 eV far the sample reduced at 920 degrees C.

Here we examine the possibility that this effect is related to dynamical two-dimensional spin correlations, incommensurate with the crystal lattice, that have been observed in La2-xSrxCuO4 by neutron scattering(2-4). A possible explanation for the incommensurability involves a coupled, dynamical modulation of spin and charge in which antiferromagnetic 'stripes' of copper spins are separated by periodically spaced domain walls to which the holes segregate(5-9). An ordered stripe phase of this type has recently been observed in hole-doped La2NiO4 (refs 10-12). We present evidence from neutron diffraction that in the copper oxide material La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4, with x=0.12, a static analogue of the dynamical stripe phase is present, and is associated with an anomalous suppression of superconductivity(13,14).

The relative role of the first of them, oxygen interstitial migration in the rock-salt-type layers of the K2NiF4-Iike lattice, increases with increasing temperature; the role of oxygen vacancy diffusion in the perovskite layers increases when temperature decreases. This behavior was attributed to the lower activation energy for ionic conduction via the vacancy diffusion mechanism. The oxygen permeability of the title materials was found to be limited by both bulk ionic conductivity and surface exchange rates and may thus be enhanced by catalytically active layers, including Pt, Ag and praseodymium oxide, deposited on the membrane surface.

We report measurements of the oxygen diffusivity parallel and perpendicular to the [001] direction, from 450 to 900 degreesC, using the technique combining isotopic O-16/O-18 exchange and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) spectroscopy. The diffusion is about one to two orders of magnitude higher in the (a,b) plane when compared to the perpendicular direction. The activation energy of the diffusion measured in the (a,b) plane is close to the one (E-a similar to 0.9 eV) measured in the ceramics and in agreement, as expected, with a mechanism involving the interstitial oxygen O-i(2-) as major diffusing species. This prevailing mechanism may explain, at least partly, the good efficiency of such materials when used as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) devices. Although the diffusivity parallel to the [001] axis is small, its activation energy is about four times weaker (E-a similar to 0.25 eV) than the one observed in the (a,b) plane. This result is in agreement with a non-stoichiometry model involving anti-phase boundaries in such materials, which induce the stabilization of oxygen vacancies in the NiO2 layers. The corresponding proposed mechanism involves the transfer of smaller O-i(-) species, with a low concentration but a high mobility. Furthermore, electronic conduction seems to play a key role in this mechanism. Finally, we measured a low anisotropy for the values of the surface exchange coefficients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The present neutron scattering study of an x = 0.225 crystal demonstrates that the spin and charge order can also be incommensurate. In fact, the incommensurability is temperature dependent, as observed previously in La2NiO4.125, indicating that such behavior is intrinsic to the doped NiO2 layers and not dependent on ordering of the dopant ions. A careful analysis of the unusual variation of peak widths as a function of momentum transfer perpendicular to the planes shows that the charge- and spin-density modulations are tied to the lattice, with the shift in phase of the charge modulations from one layer to the next equal to exactly one in-plane lattice spacing.

The direct decomposition of NO over perovskite and related mixed oxide catalysts follows a redox mechanism. The lower valent metal ions Ni2+ and disordered oxygen vacancies seem to be the active sites in the redox process. The oxygen vacancy plays an important role favorable for the adsorption and activation of NO molecules on one hand and on the other hand for increasing the mobility of lattice oxygen which is beneficial to the reproduction of active sites.

The structure of the La2NiO4 lattice between the interstitial layers is of the Bmab-type; the superlattice peaks result from the ordered autiphase domain boundaries induced by the interstitial oxygens, which sit at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)-type position.. Observed orderings involve interstitial layers separated by two to four Ni-O layers. Peak shapes and positions are modelled quantitatively using the formulas of Hendricks and Teller for one-dimensional disorder in a layer lattice. Besides the one-dimensional ordering of the intercalant layers, temperature-dependent phase separations are observed. Because of the slow ordering kinetics, phase separation can be suppressed by rapid cooling.", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "50", "authors": ["TRANQUADA, JM", "KONG, Y", "LORENZO, JE", "BUTTREY, DJ", "RICE, DE", "SACHAN, V"], "issue": "9", "pages": "6340-6351"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.35.7126", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 1 1987", "title": "TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLASMON IN NONSTOICHIOMETRIC LA2NIO4\n", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.35.7126", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "35", "authors": ["BASSAT, JM", "ODIER, P", "GERVAIS, F"], "issue": "13", "pages": "7126-7128"}, {"DOI": "10.1006/jcat.2000.2941", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951700929415/pdf?md5=d330a4778492bf238cb857497438c9a7&pid=1-s2.0-S0021951700929415-main.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 10 2000", "title": "CO2/CH4 reforming over Ni-La2O3/5A: An investigation on carbon deposition and reaction steps", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951700929415", "abstract": "Carbon deposition and reaction pathways in CO2/CH4 reforming over Ni-La2O3/5A have been studied by means of XRD, in situ TG, pulse experiments, chemical trapping, TEM, and EPR. The XRD results revealed that due to the formation of perovskite-like La2NiO4 phase in Ni-La2O3/5A, the small-size (ca. 9 nm) Ni-0 crystallites formed in H-2 reduction remained unsintered during 48 h of on-stream reaction at 800 degrees C. The accumulation of carbon on the active sites was the main reason for Ni-La2O3/5A deactivation. The detection of (CO2)-C-13 and CO2 in O-2 pulsing onto a sample pretreated with (CH4)-C-13/CO2 confirmed that the deposited carbon was from both CH4 and CO2. The (CO2)-C-13/CO2 molar ratio decreased with the rise in temperature, indicating that the contribution of CO2 toward deposited carbon was larger than that of CH4 at higher temperatures. In CO and CO2/CH4 atmospheres, we observed similar TG patterns and obtained identical TEM images of deposited carbon; we propose that carbon deposition is mainly via CO disproportionation. The observation of CD3COOH in CD3I chemical trapping experiments suggested that HCOO was an intermediate of CO2/CH4 reforming. The amount of CO2 converted was roughly proportional to the amount of H present on the catalyst surface. These results indicate that CO2 activation could be H-assisted. Pulsing CH4 onto a H-2-reduced Ni-La2O3/5A catalyst and a similar catalyst treated with CO2, we found that CH4 conversion was higher in the latter case. Hence, the idea of oxygen-assisted CH4 dissociation is plausible. As for methane conversion, k(H)/k(D) of 1.2 and 1.1 at 600 and 700 degrees C, respectively, were observed, implying that C-H cleavages are slow kinetic steps in CH4/CO2 reforming. Based on these experimental results, we have derived reaction pathways for CO2/CH4 reforming, the decomposition of CHxO (x = 1 or 2) is considered to be the rate-determining step for syngas formation.

The catalysts were tested in reduced and non-reduced form. High CH4 and CO2 conversion were obtained without carbon deposition. This result was explained by the occurrence of the RWGS (reverse water gas shift) reaction. The La2NiO4 perovskite used as precursor presents the smallest nickel particles after the reduction treatment. Consequently the catalytic activity is higher than that obtained with Ni/La2O3 or LaNiO3.\n\nWhen La2NiO4 is used without treatment prior to the reaction high methane and carbon dioxide conversions are reached but a carbon deposition is observed. The perovskite structure is not completely transformed and the presence of metallic nickel particles at the surface of La2NiO4 would be responsible for the carbon deposition. It is assumed that the role of the support is to allow the activation of carbon dioxide, which is favoured over La2O3 whereas it is limited over La2NiO4. Consequently the reaction between the complex C-Ni species (resulting from methane activation at the surface of the nickel particle) and gaseous CO2 is inhibited over Ni/La2NiO4 leading to a carbon accumulation at the surface of the catalyst.\n\nAs soon as the perovskite structure is completely transformed, after reductive treatment or during the reaction, a high activity is reached and no carbon deposition was further observed, the catalytic performances being optimal when the average nickel particles size is the smallest, (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Measurements were performed on c-axis oriented La2NiO4+delta films grown on SrTiO3 (100) and NdGaO3 (110) by pulsed injection metal organic chemical vapour deposition (PIMOCVD), with different thicknesses ranging from 33 to 370 nm. The effect that the strain induced by the film-substrate mismatch has on the oxygen diffusion through the film was evaluated. Both tracer diffusion coefficients, along the c-axis and along the ab plane, were found to increase with film thickness, i.e., as the stress of the film decreases, while the thickness seems to have no effect on the tracer surface exchange coefficient. Best fits were obtained when considering the thickest films composed by two regions with different c-axis tracer diffusion coefficient values, a higher and constant D* close to the film surface and a variable decreasing D* closer to the substrate. As expected, the tracer diffusion and surface exchange coefficients are thermally activated and are approximately two orders of magnitude higher along the ab plane than along the c- axis. The low activation energies of D* compared with bulk values for both directions at low temperatures seem to confirm the contribution of a vacancy mechanism to the ionic conduction.", "ISSN": "0959-9428", "pub": "JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY", "volume": "18", "authors": ["Burriel, M", "Garcia, G", "Santiso, J", "Kilner, JA", "Richard, JCC", "Skinner, SJ"], "issue": "4", "pages": "416-422"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.52.9576", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 1 1995", "title": "THEORY OF PHONON-ASSISTED MULTIMAGNON OPTICAL-ABSORPTION AND BIMAGNON STATES IN QUANTUM ANTIFERROMAGNETS", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.52.9576", "abstract": "We calculate the effective charge for multimagnon infrared absorption assisted by phonons in a perovskitelike antiferromagnet and we compute the spectra for two-magnon absorption using interacting spin-wave theory.

The compounds were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The LaNiO3 perovskite exhibited activity to methane reforming, but suffered a slow deactivation with time-on-stream. Nevertheless, substitution of the A site metal ion with a tetravalent metal cation (Ce) led to an increase in catalytic activity. Moreover, the insertion of Ce increased the stability of the catalysts with respect to the reforming reaction. The La0.95Ce0.05NiO3 catalyst showed the highest activity, with CO2 conversion of 62% at 1023 K. The XRD and TPR analyses confirmed that at high Cc contents, ceria appears as segregated CeO2 Phase and interferes with the rate of perovskite structure formation, so that NiO and La2NiO4 are produced. As a consequence of the low solubility of cerium oxide, its insertion in the perovskite structure is also possible in the low Ce-content regions. This low amount of cerium incorporated is responsible not only for the enhancement of catalytic performance of the perovskite after its activation by reduction, but also for the inhibition of carbon formation.

The thermal expansion coefficients have been determined to be in the range of 10.8-13.0 x 10(-6) K-1. Total conductivity values are as good as 87 S cm(-1) at 580 degrees C for x= 0.4.

For all the electrode compositions studied, the best specific resistance (ASR) values were obtained with LSGM as electrolyte. The better performance of x=0.4 and 0.6 (ASR similar to 1 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C) compositions has been associated with the magnitude of the total conductivity and the matching of the TEC values of the cathodes with those of the electrolytes.

Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques-analytical (spin-wave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renormalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical Neel ground state, appear to be small. At any nonzero temperature the order disappear and the correlation length at low temperature T(k(B)T/J << 1, where J is the antiferromagnetic coupling) follows the singular form zeta(T) = C exp(alpha-J/k(B)T). In the long-wavelength limit and at low T, the model has the same behavior as the quantum nonlinear-sigma-model in two spatial dimensions and one Euclidean time dimension, which we also study with available analytical and Monte Carlo techniques. The quasiparticles of the theory are bosons; at low T and for wavelengths shorter than the correlation length they are well-defined spin-wave excitations. The spectrum of such excitations and the temperature-dependent correlation length have been determined by neutron and Raman scattering experiments done on La2CuO4. The good agreement of the experimental data with the predictions of this theory suggests that the magnetic state of the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss, within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term, introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform susceptibility.

Recently the mercury-bearing compound HgBa2RCu2O6+delta (Hg-1212) was synthesized3 (where R is a rare-earth element), with a structure similar to the thallium-bearing superconductor TlBa2CaCu2O7 (Tl-1212), which has one TlO layer and two CuO2 layers per unit cell, and a T(c) of 85 K (ref. 2).

The measurements are made at room temperature over an energy range from 0.004 to 35 eV for the polarization parallel to the CuO2 planes.  They are also extended to the perpendicular polarization to study anisotropy and to discriminate the contribution from the CuO2 plane.  The present study focuses on the x dependence of the optical spectrum, which makes it possible to sort out the features of the excitations in the CuO2 plane and thus to characterize the electronic structure of the CuO2 plane in the respective phase.  Upon doping into the parent insulator La2CuO4 with a charge-transfer energy gap of about 2 eV the spectral weight is rapidly transferred from the charge-transfer excitation to low-energy excitations below 1.5 eV.  The low-energy spectrum is apparently composed of two contributions; a Drude-type one peaked at omega = 0 and a broad continuum centered in the midinfrared range.  The high-T(c) superconductivity is realized as doping proceeds and when the transfer of the spectrum weight is saturated.

We first present accurate measurements of the magnetic correlation length and the sublattice magnetization of a carrier-free La2CuO4 crystal and analyze these in the context of recent theoretical predictions. We then systematically investigate the influence of different dopants on the magnetism: Our measurements indicate that static vacancies in the La2Cu1-yZnyO4 system affect the magnetic correlations in a similar manner as electrons in Pr2-xCexCuO4. The magnetic correlation length is much more rapidly suppressed as a function of x in La2-xSrxCuO4, and for x less-than-or-equal-to 0.04 we find that it obeys the empirical relation xi-1(x,T)=xi-1(x,0)+xi-1(0,T), where xi(0,T) is the measured correlation length of the carrier-free sample.

Our neutron measurements show that the generalized susceptibility of this sample follows a surprisingly simple scaling function in the variable omega/T.

Then, the high-energy and chain-related degrees of freedom are integrated out and we arrive at two, nearest-neighbor, orthogonal, two-center, 8-band Hamiltonians H-8(+) and H-8(-) for respectively the even and odd bands of the bi-layer. Of the 8 orbitals Cu(x)2-(y)2. O2(x), O3(y) and Cu-s have sigma character and Cu-xz, Cu-yz, O2(z), and O3(z) have pi character. The roles of the Cu-s orbital, which has some Cu(3z)2-(1) character, and the four pi orbitais are as follows: Cu-s provides 2nd- and 3rd-nearest-neighbor (t' and t '') intra-plane hopping, as well as hopping between planes (t(perpendicular to)). The pi-orbitals are responsible for bifurcation of the saddle-points for dimpled planes. The 4-sigma-band Hamiltonian is generic for flat CuO2 planes and we use it for analytical studies The k(parallel to)-dependence is expressed as one on u = (cos bk(y) + cos ak(x))/2 and one on nu = (cos bk(y) - cos ak(x))/2. The latter arises solely through the influence of Cu-s. The reduction of the (sigma-Hamiltonian to 3- and 1-band Hamiltonians is explicitly discussed and we point out that, in addition to the hoppings commonly included in many-body calculations, the 3-band Hamiltonian should include hopping between all 2nd-nearest-neighbor oxygens and that the 1-band Hamiltonian should include 3rd-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We calculate the single-particle hopping between the planes of a bi-layer and show that it is generically: t(perpendicular to) (k(parallel to)) approximate to 0.25 eV .nu(2) (1 - 2ut'/t)(-2). The hopping through insulating spacers such as (BaO)Hg(BaO) is an order of magnitude smaller, but seems to have the same k(parallel to)-dependence. We show that the inclusion of t' is crucial for understanding ARPES for the anti-ferromagnetic insulator Sr2CuO2Cl2. Finally, we estimate the value of the inter-plane exchange constant J(perpendicular to) for an un-doped bi-layer in mean-field theory using different single-particle Hamiltonians, the LDA for YBa2Cu3O6, the eight- and four-band Hamiltonians, as well as an analytical calculation for the latter.

In this work we present the method which delivers the correct insulating antiferromagnetic ground state in the correlated oxides preserving other properties as well as the efficiency of the standard LDA. The method embeds the relevant (for a given system of electrons) part of the Hubbard Hamiltonian into the Kohn-Sham LDA equation.

In the case of La2CuO4 the energy gap and the value of the localized magnetic moment in the stable insulating antiferromagnetic solution are in good agreement with experiment. We compare our results with the standard local spin density approximation calculation and multiband Hubbard model calculations, as well as with results of spectroscopy: inverse photoemission, valence photoemission, and x-ray absorption at the K edge of oxygen.

The underlying evolution of the electron system in the absence of superconductivity is still unclear, and a question of central importance is whether it involves any intermediate phase with broken symmetry(1). The Fermi surface of the electronic states in the underdoped 'YBCO' materials YBa2Cu3Oy and YBa2Cu4O8 was recently shown to include small pockets(2-4), in contrast with the large cylinder that characterizes the overdoped regime(5), pointing to a topological change in the Fermi surface. Here we report the observation of a negative Hall resistance in the magnetic-field-induced normal state of YBa2Cu3Oy and YBa2Cu4O8, which reveals that these pockets are electron-like rather than hole-like. We propose that these electron pockets most probably arise from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by the onset of a density-wave phase, as is thought to occur in the electron-doped copper oxides near the onset of antiferromagnetic order(6,7). Comparison with materials of the La2CuO4 family that exhibit spin/charge density-wave order(8-11) suggests that a Fermi surface reconstruction also occurs in those materials, pointing to a generic property of high-transition-temperature (T-c) superconductors.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "450", "authors": ["LeBoeuf, D", "Doiron-Leyraud, N", "Levallois, J", "Daou, R", "Bonnemaison, JB", "Hussey, NE", "Balicas, L", "Ramshaw, BJ", "Liang, RX", "Bonn, DA", "Hardy, WN", "Adachi, S", "Proust, C", "Taillefer, L"], "issue": "7169", "pages": "533-536"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.69.064512", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2004", "title": "Effect of chemical inhomogeneity in bismuth-based copper oxide superconductors", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.69.064512", "abstract": "We examine the effect on the superconducting transition temperature (T-c) of chemical inhomogeneities in Bi2Sr2CuO6+delta and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta single crystals.
