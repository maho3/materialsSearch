Here, we generated tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible transgenic mice (Ick-(ERSCL)-S-T2_) to study the consequences of acquired SCL activation during T-cell development. Aberrant activation of SCL in thymocytes resulted in the accumulation of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) (double-positive, DP) cells by preventing normal surface expression of the T-cell receptor alpha beta (TCR alpha beta) complex. SCL-induced immature DID cells were further characterized by up-regulated NOTCH1 and generated noncycling polyclonal CD8(+)TCR beta(low) cells. The prevalence of these cells was SCL dependent because TAM withdrawal resulted in their disappearance. Furthermore, we observed that SCL activation led to a dramatic up-regulation of NOTCH1 target genes (Hes-1, Deltex1, and CD25) in thymocytes. Strikingly, NOTCH1 target gene up-regulation was already observed after short-term SCL induction, implying that enhanced NOTCH signaling is mediated by SCL and is not dependent on secondary genetic events. These data represent the basis for a novel pathway of SCL-induced leukemogenesis and provide a functional link between SCL and NOTCH1 during this process.", "ISSN": "0006-4971", "pub": "BLOOD", "volume": "110", "authors": ["Gothert, JR", "Brake, RL", "Smeets, M", "Duhrsen, U", "Begley, CG", "Izon, DJ"], "DOIlink": "http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/110/10/3753?sso-checked=true", "issue": "10", "pages": "3753-3762"}]], [{"formation_energy_per_atom": -1.8286234165033328, "band_gap": 2.3644999999999996, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

The sensor Is basically one application of a dissolved oxygen electrode. Magnetic sludge was prepared by mixing magnetite powder with acclimated activated sludge. A magnetic cathode, comprised of a Sm-Co magnet plated with platinum, was covered by a Teflon membrane; magnetic sludge was simply layered on the membrane by magnetic attraction. The magnetic sludge decomposed the BOD component with consumption of oxygen. The BOD could therefore be determined by measuring the electric current produced by the BOD sensor. This current was then converted into the concentration change of oxygen transported through the Teflon membrane from the magnetic sludge layer.", "ISSN": "0922-338X", "pub": "JOURNAL OF FERMENTATION AND BIOENGINEERING", "volume": "80", "authors": ["SAKAI, Y", "ABE, N", "TAKEUCHI, S", "TAKAHASHI, F"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0922338X9590836O", "issue": "3", "pages": "300-303"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/BF00865164", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00865164.pdf", "pubDate": "1996", "title": "Relationships of Australian sugarcane yields to various climatic variables", "abstract": "The relationship between the sugarcane yield anomalies in northeastern Australia and various atmospheric and oceanic variables is examined with the help of three different climatological data sets, the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS), the Southern Hemisphere Analyses data set (SHANAL) and the Tabulated Data Set (TDS). Correlation coefficients of 10 different climatological variables with the yields are presented for lags up to twelve months prior to the harvest. The results suggest that the sugarcane yields show the strongest positive (negative) response to anomalous sea surface temperature (SSTA) and mean sea level pressure (MSLPA) changes occurring in the central and eastern Pacific during the austral spring 7 to 10 months prior to the sugarcane harvest. These correlations are accompanied by an opposite pattern of anomalies located north of Australia. At the same time, anomalies in the strength of the zonal components of the surface winds can be found over the western tropical Pacific (positive correlations) and the eastern Indian Ocean (negative correlations). These patterns are characteristic of the Fl Nine-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal and support the findings of a previous Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)-oriented study. However, the maximum correlations with the SSTA and MSLPA are substantially higher (around \\0.8\\) than those reached with the SOI (-0.65). Furthermore, it appears that the large-scale circulation indices are better indicators of sugarcane yields than the regional (Cairns) climatological variables.

While initial twin jet deposition of the reagents did not lead to product formation, new bands were noted following irradiation with light lambda > 300 nm. In the reactions of CrCl2O2 and aniline, irradiation led to HCl formation, very likely accompanied by CrClO2(H)NC6H5 formation, and a mixture of isomers of CrCl2O-aminocyclohexa-2,4-dienone via oxygen atom transfer. CrCl2O2 and aniline were also codeposited as cryogenic thin films, producing new bands. Irradiation of these films led to further growth of these bands. The same products were identified in the thin film studies as were observed in the argon matrix experiments. The irradiation of the matrices containing CrCl2O2 and anisole and N,N-dimethylaniline were shown to lead to oxygen atom transfer, forming complexes between the corresponding cyclic ketone derivatives and CrCl2O. The identification of the complexes were supported by density functional calculations at the B3LYF/6-311G++(d,2p) level and isotopic labeling (in the case of aniline). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The variation of the atomic coordinates and interatomic distances, observed between the RMnSi2 and RMnCu0.5Ge1.5 series, well account for enhanced Cu-Ge bonds compared to the corresponding Si-Si ones. Simultaneously, a weakening of the Mn-Ge bonds is observed. The modifications of these chemical bondings are correlated to drastic changes of the Mn sublattice magnetic properties.

The first polymorphism examined, a C-->T transition at nucleotide position 181 of the DYS199 locus, was previously reported only in Native American populations. To investigate the origin of this DYS199 polymorphism, we screened Y chromosomes from a number of Siberian, Asian, and Native American populations for this and other markers. This survey detected the T allele in all five Native American populations studied at an average frequency of 61%, and in two of nine native Siberian populations, the Siberian Eskimo (21%) and the Chukchi (17%). This finding suggested that the DYS199 T allele may have originated in Beringia and was then spread throughout the New World by the founding populations of the major subgroups of modem Native Americans. We further characterized Native American Y chromosome variation by analyzing two additional Y chromosome polymorphisms, the DYS287 Y Alu polymorphic (YAP) element insertion and a YAP-associated A-->G transition at DYS271, both commonly found in Africans. We found neither African allele associated with the DYS199 T allele in any of the Native American or native Siberian populations. However, we did find DYS287 YAP+ individuals who harbored the DYS199 C allele in one Native American population, the Mire, and in one Asian group, the Tibetans. A correlation of these Y chromosome alleles in Native Americans with these of the DYS1 locus, as detected by the p49a/p49f (p49a,f) probes on TaqI-digested genomic DNA, revealed a complete association of DYS1 alleles (p49a,f haplotypes) 13, 18, 66, 67 and 69 with the DYS199 T allele, while DYS1 alleles 8 and 63 were associated with both the DYS199 C and T allele.", "ISSN": "0340-6717", "pub": "HUMAN GENETICS", "volume": "100", "authors": ["Lell, JT", "Brown, MD", "Schurr, TG", "Sukernik, RI", "Starikovskaya, YB", "Torroni, A", "Moore, LG", "Troup, GM", "Wallace, DC"], "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004390050548", "issue": "5-6", "pages": "536-543"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0022-0248(02)02292-3", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022024802022923/pdfft?md5=40f82a89cc82061c816cd5b9c36e4f3e&pid=1-s2.0-S0022024802022923-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 2003", "title": "Ordered arrays of rare-earth silicide nanowires on Si(001)", "abstract": "Ordered arrays of self-assembled ErSi2-x, SMSi2-x, and DySi2-x nanowires aligned along Si [1 1 0] have been grown at 600degreesC on Si(0 0 1) vicinal substrates.

H pylori in the above mentioned tissues was detected by Warthin-Starry stain and rapid urease tests.

Inhibiting the activity of NF-kappa B is an effective and promising way to prevent intestinal type gastric carcinoma.", "ISSN": "1007-9327", "pub": "WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY", "volume": "10", "authors": ["Yang, GF", "Deng, CS", "Xiong, YY", "Gong, LL", "Wang, BC", "Luo, J"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "4", "pages": "491-496"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.1897424", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/apl/86/14/1.1897424.pdf;jsessionid=apbcpffa8p6t.x-aip-live-02?itemId=/content/aip/journal/apl/86/14/10.1063/1.1897424&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/apl", "pubDate": "APR 4 2005", "title": "Epitaxial DySi2 nanowire formation on stepped si(111)", "abstract": "We report the growth of epitaxial DySi2 nanowires (NW) with a single orientation on miscut Si(111).

The thickness of the a-Si was selected to be such that the consumption of Si atoms from the substrate is minimized by taking into account the formation of an amorphous interlayer at the Dy/Si(111) interface. Based on our experimental findings, a new mechanism for the formation of pinhole is proposed. The Stranski-Krastanov growth behavior of epitaxial DySi2-x on Si(111) by solid phase epitaxy leads to the apparently random formation of a high density of recessed regions at the initial stage of silicidation. Polycrystalline DySi2-x was found to be present at the areas inside and epitaxial DySi2-x outside the recessed regions. Large numbers of Si atoms from the substrate can therefore diffuse through the recessed regions. As a result, the depth and size of the recessed regions increase with annealing time. Finally, the DySi2-x thin layer inside the recessed regions with higher interface energy is thermally unstable and breaks apart to form pinholes. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

Using quantitative real-time PCR amplification of the DYS1 sequence, elevation of plasma fDNA levels after TOP was observed, especially in the late first trimester. This corresponds with the functional development of the placental vascular structure and fetal hematopoiesis.

Therefore, we also developed a real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR assay of the gamma-globin transcript as a marker of fetal erythroid cells. Although plasma gamma-globin mRNA levels were decreased after TOP in many patients, an elevation was observed in some patients at greater than 9 weeks' gestation, which is consistent with the increase in plasma fDNA levels.

The CrB-ordering is described by the wave vector: q(1) = (0, 0, 1/2) over the entire magnetically ordered regime with a uniaxial magnetic structure along the shortest axis c. The FeB-type magnetic phase diagram reveals three distinct regions of magnetic ordering below T(N) and one first order transition at T(2)=23.5K (on heating). The ordering is described by two symmetry independent magnetic vectors q(2)=(0, 1/2,1/6) and q(3)=(0, q(3y), q(3z)) with a temperature variable length. At 1.5 K q(3y) approximate to 1/2 and q(3z) approximate to 1/11. The two phases coexist in the form of domains. They differ in the moment orientation of the q(3) phase that deviates by similar to 22 degrees from the b-axis in the (0, 0, 1) plane. The low temperature range (LT) 1.5 K-T(2) subdivides into two regions: (i) LT-1, between 1.5 K-T(1) where the relative amount of the two phases remains unchanged and in (ii) LT-2: T(1)-T(2) where the amount of the incommensurate q3 phase increases at the cost of the commensurate q(2) amplitude modulated structure which remains unchanged but fully disappears at the first order transition at T(2)=23.5 K. The q(3) phase undergoes minor changes until 22 K and gets destabilised at T(2) where the q(3z) component jumps from the LT value q(3z) approximate to 1/11 to the HT value approximate to 1/7 and the q(3y) component increases from 0.484(1) to 0.495(1).

The wave vector q(2) when referring to the (a, 2b, c) cell and the wave vector q = (0, 0, 1/6) corresponds to a transversal modulation, which by a proper origin choice can be also described as an antiphase domain structure with two amplitudes. The moments point to the b-axis and are stacked in the sequence (+m(o)/2, -m(o)/2, -m(o), -m(o)/2, + m(o)/2, +m(o), ...) along the c-direction, while t(b) acts as an antitranslation.

At room temperature, the magnetic structures are characterized by a stacking of antiferromagnetic (001) Mn layers with Mn magnetic moments (about 3.6-3.2 mu(B), at 2 K) at 40 degrees (CeMnGe) or along the c axis. In all cases, this antiferromagnetic arrangement of the Mn sublattice persists down to 2 K. At lower temperature, the R sublattice orders in ferromagnetic (001) layers, with various ordering schemes along the stacking axis. At 150 K, PrMnGe exhibits ferromagnetic behaviour followed by a ferro-antiferromagnetic transition below 80 K simultaneously with a crystallographic phase transition (tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry).\n\nBelow 200 K, NdMnGe exhibits a ferromagnetic ordering of the Nd sublattice which persists until 2 K. Within the complete ordering temperature range, the Pr and Nd magnetic moments are in the basal plane with a magnitude of 2.45(3) and 3(1) mu(B), for Pr and Nd, respectively, at 2K. The magnetic structures correspond to the sequence Mn(AF)R(+)R(+)Mn(AF)R(-or+). The Mn moments rotate at 50 degrees from the c axis in PrMnGe, while they are in quadrature in NdMnGe. In CeMnGe, the Ce-sublattice orders antiferromagnetically below about 130 K (not detected in the magnetometric measurements), yielding the following ordering scheme: Mn(AF)Ce(+)Ce(+)Mn(AF)Ce(-)Ce(-); at 2 K the Ce moment value is 2.2(1) mu(B). The Mn and Ce moment directions are almost parallel, and make an angle of about 35 degrees with the c axis. The results are discussed and compared to those obtained previously on the corresponding ternary silicides and germanides of the CeFeSi- and ThCr2Si2-type structures.", "ISSN": "0925-8388", "pub": "JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS", "volume": "228", "authors": ["WELTER, R", "VENTURINI, G", "RESSOUCHE, E", "MALAMAN, B"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0925838895016597", "issue": "1", "pages": "59-74"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2005", "title": "Static Properties of Magnetic Phase Transition for Pr0.8La0.2MnGe", "abstract": "The static properties of the magnetic phase transitions for the layered structure Pr0:8La0:2MnGe have been studied in the temperature range from 300 K to 10 K.

PrMnGe is known to be antiferromagnetic with T-N = 415 K. It orders ferromagnetically at 150 K and again becomes antiferromagnetic below 80 K. We have found that the ferromagnetic ordering temperature (T-2) and the magnetization decrease with increasing La concentration in Pr1-xLaxMnGe. The low-temperature antiferromagnetic ordering temperature (T-1) is also found to decrease with increasing La concentration. The small Pr-Pr contact distance (which may occur due to a low affinity of lanthanide and Mn elements) is thought to be responsible for the high ordering temperature of Pr moments. Resistivity data have clearly indicated the antiferro- to ferromagnetic (T-2) and the ferro- to antiferromagnetic (T-1) transitions. Thermal expansivity data suggest the T-1 transition to be of first order and the T-2 transition to be of second order.

Changes in Ca2+i produced by cyanide greatly exceeded those induced by GLU.  The NaCN response was mimicked when oxidative metabolism was also disrupted by sodium azide, oligomycin, or dinitrophenol.  Noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists and enzymatic GLU degradation abolished the GLU-induced Ca2+i increases and attenuated those produced by NaCN.  Only NaCN-induced increases were blocked when dantrolene and ruthenium red were applied to prevent release from intracellular pools.  All responses were reduced proportionally in the absence of added external calcium.  These results suggest that extracellular GLU accumulation and subsequent activation of GLU receptors were involved in the NaCN response.

Since paclitaxel is excluded from some tumors by p-glycoprotein (p-gp), the same mechanism may prevent entry into the brain. in vitro, paclitaxel transport was examined in capillaries from rat brains by confocal microscopy using BODIPY Fl-paclitaxel. Western blots and immunostaining demonstrated apical expression of p-gp in isolated endothelial cells, vessels, and tissue. Secretion of BODIPY Fl-paclitaxel into capillary lumens was specific and energy-dependent. Steady state luminal fluorescence significantly exceeded cellular fluorescence and was reduced by NaCN, paclitaxel, and SDZ PSC-833 (valspodar), a p-gp blocker. Leukotriene C-4 (LTC4), an Mrp2-substrate, had no effect. Luminal accumulation of NBDL-cyclosporin, a p-gp substrate, was inhibited by paclitaxel. In vivo, paclitaxel levels in the brain, liver, kidney, and plasma of nude mice were determined after intravenous injection. Co-administration of valspodar led to increased paclitaxel levels in brains compared to monotherapy.

The TBA has a random coil structure that changes into a G-quartet structure and a hairpin-like structure upon binding Pb(2+) and Hg(2+) ions, respectively. As a result, the fluorescence decreases through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorophore and quencher.'Ibese changes in fluorescence intensity allow the selective detection of Pb(2+) and Hg(2+) ions at concentrations as low as 300 pM and 5.0 nM using this TBA probe in the presence of phytic acid and a random DNA/NaCN mixture, respectively. The linear correlation existed between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of Pb(2+) and Hg(2+) over the range of 0.5-30 nM (R(2) = 0.98) and 10-200 nM (R(2) = 0.98), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a single DNA-based sensor that allows the detection of both Hg(2+) and Pb(2+) ions.

Here, we examined whether these neurons respond to peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation and whether the input is direct from the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) or indirect via the respiratory network. A dense neuronal projection from commissural NTS (commNTS) to RTN was revealed using the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). Within RTN, 51% of BDA-labelled axonal varicosities contained detectable levels of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2) but only 5% contained glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67). Awake rats were exposed to hypoxia (n = 6) or normoxia (n = 5) 1 week after injection of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) into RTN. Hypoxia-activated neurons were identified by the presence of Fos-immunoreactive nuclei. CommNTS neurons immunoreactive for both Fos and CTB were found only in hypoxia-treated rats. VGLUT2 mRNA was detected in 92 +/- 13% of these neurons whereas only 12 +/- 9% contained GAD67 mRNA. In urethane-chloralose-anaesthetized rats, bilateral inhibition of the RTN with muscimol eliminated the phrenic nerve discharge (PND) at rest, during hyperoxic hypercapnia (10% CO2), and during peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation (hypoxia and/or i.v. sodium cyanide, NaCN). RTN CO2-activated neurons were recorded extracellularly in anaesthetized intact or vagotomized rats. These neurons were strongly activated by hypoxia (10-15% O-2; 30 s) or by NaCN. Hypoxia and NaCN were ineffective in rats with carotid chemoreceptor denervation. Bilateral injection of muscimol into the ventral respiratory column 1.5 mm caudal to RTN eliminated PND and the respiratory modulation of RTN neurons. Muscimol did not change the threshold and sensitivity of RTN neurons to hyperoxic hypercapnia nor their activation by peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation. In conclusion, RTN neurons respond to brain P-CO2 presumably via their intrinsic chemosensitivity and to carotid chemoreceptor activation via a direct glutamatergic pathway from commNTS that bypasses the respiratory network.

The uterus, cervix, and vaginal canal are innervated by afferent fibers in the hypogastric and pelvic nerves. Four studies compared the innervation territory and sensitivity to peripheral stimuli of the two sets of fibers in adult virgin rats.\n\n2. Innervation territory was studied anatomically by injecting different fluorescent dyes into different parts of the reproductive, lower urinary, and lower digestive tracts and examining retrogradely labeled neurons in dorsal root ganglia. It was also studied electrophysiologically in anesthetized rats by summing potentials evoked in branches of the two nerves by electrical stimulation of different parts of the reproductive tract.\n\n3. In both studies sensory innervation of the reproductive tract shifted from the pelvic to the hypogastric nerve (i.e., shifted entry into the spinal cord from the L6-S1 to the T13-L3 dorsal root ganglia, respectively) as the dye or stimulating electrode shifted from the vaginal entrance to the uterine horns, with fibers from both nerves densely innervating the cervix region (i.e., entering the spinal cord through both sets of ganglia). The anatomic results suggested that the regions innervated by fibers in one nerve might also be innervated by a small component of normally quiescent fibers in the other nerve.\n\n4. Response sensitivity was studied electrophysiologically by simultaneously recording multiunit activity in branches of the hypogastric and pelvic nerves in two ways. First, in intact, anesthetized rats, activity was recorded during mechanical stimulation of the reproductive tract (distension of the vagina and uterus, probing the cervix). Second, in an in vitro organ preparation of the uterus and vagina, activity was recorded during chemical stimulation through the uterine artery with bradykinin, serotonin, NaCN, CO2, and KCl.\n\n5. Pelvic nerve fibers were markedly more sensitive than hypogastric nerve fibers to uterine and cervical mechanostimulation. Similarly, pelvic nerve fibers were more likely to respond or responded more vigorously than hypogastric nerve fibers to all chemical stimuli (except KCl).\n\n6. These results provide strong evidence that afferent fibers in the pelvic and hypogastric nerves of nulliparous adult rats subserve different functions in reproduction and sensation.

We isolated a rice mutant (GR1) that is defective in active Si uptake by screening M-2 seeds (64,000) of rice cv Oochikara that were treated with 10(-3) M sodium azide for 6 h at 25degreesC. There were no phenotypic differences between wild type (WT) and GR1 except that the leaf blade of GR1 remained droopy when Si was supplied. Uptake experiments showed that Si uptake by GR1 was significantly lower than that by WT at both low and high Si concentrations. However, there was no difference in the uptake of other nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium. Si concentration in the xylem sap of WT was 33-fold that of the external solution, but that of GR1 was 3-fold higher than the external solution at 0.15 mm Si. Si uptake by WT was inhibited by metabolic inhibitors including NaCN and 2,4-dinitrophenol and by low temperature, whereas Si uptake by GR1 was not inhibited by these agents. These results suggest that an active transport system for Si uptake is disrupted in GR1. Analysis of F-2 populations between GR1 and WT showed that roots with high Si uptake and roots with low Si uptake segregated at a 3:1 ratio, suggesting that GR1 is a recessive mutant of Si uptake.", "ISSN": "0032-0889", "pub": "PLANT PHYSIOLOGY", "volume": "130", "authors": ["Ma, JF", "Tamai, K", "Ichii, M", "Wu, GF"], "DOIlink": "http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/130/4/2111", "issue": "4", "pages": "2111-2117"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 1940", "title": "Metabolism of the estrogens - The effect of liver and uterus upon estrone, estradiol and estriol", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0013-7227", "pub": "ENDOCRINOLOGY", "volume": "26", "authors": ["Heller, CG"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "4", "pages": "619-630"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1933", "title": "Testings on the causes of selective resorption of sugar from the intestine.", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0366-0753", "pub": "BIOCHEMISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT", "volume": "259", "authors": ["Wilbrandt, W", "Laszt, L"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "398-417"}, {"DOI": "10.1126/science.111.2890.543", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/111/2890/543.full.pdf", "pubDate": "1950", "title": "FORMATION OF PENTOSE PHOSPHATE FROM 6-PHOSPHOGLUCONATE", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0036-8075", "pub": "SCIENCE", "volume": "111", "authors": ["COHEN, SS", "SCOTT, DBM"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/111/2890/543", "issue": "2890", "pages": "543-544"}, {"DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M006461200", "pdflink": "http://www.jbc.org/site/misc/ASBMBjournals_MEDIAKIT.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 24 2000", "title": "Tobacco nectarin I - Purification and characterization as a germin-like, manganese superoxide dismutase implicated in the defense of floral reproductive tissues", "abstract": "Nectarin I, a protein that accumulates in the nectar of Nicotiana sp., was determined to contain superoxide dismutase activity by colorimetric and in-gel assays. This activity was found to be remarkably thermostable. Extended incubations at temperatures up to 90 degreesC did not diminish the superoxide dismutase activity of nectarin I. This attribute allowed nectarin I to be purified to homogeneity by heat denaturation of the other nectar proteins. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, nectarin I appeared as a 29-kDa monomer. If the protein sample was not boiled prior to loading the gel, then nectarin I migrated as 165-kDa oligomeric protein. By matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the protomer subunit was found to be a 22.5-kDa protein. Purified nectarin I contained 0.5 atoms of manganese/monomer, and the superoxide dismutase activity of nectarin I was not inhibited by either H2O2 or NaCN. Following denaturation, the superoxide dismutase activity was restored after Mn2+ addition. Addition of Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+/Zn2+ did not restore superoxide dismutase activity. The quaternary structure of the reconstituted enzyme was examined, and only tetrameric and pentameric aggregates were enzymatically active, The reconstituted enzyme was also shown to generate H2O2,.

After a critical period of ischemia, reperfusion precipitates irreversible injury. Previous work showed that reperfusion injury to cultured neonatal myocytes was precipitated by a rapid return to physiological pH, a ''pH paradox'' (Bond, J., B. Herman, and J. Lemasters. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 179: 798-803, 1991). The aim of this study was to measure intracellular pH (pH(i)) and cytosolic free Ca2+ during the pH paradox of reperfusion injury to cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. pH(i) and free Ca2+ were measured by ratio imaging of 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein and fura 2 fluorescence. To simulate ATP depletion and acidosis of ischemia, myocytes were incubated with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose plus 2.5 mM NaCN at pH 6.2. During simulated-ischemia, pH(i) dropped to <6.5 and subsequently remained constant. During this time, some blebbing but little hypercontraction occurred. After 3 or 4 h of simulated ischemia, inhibitors were removed and cells were incubated at pH 7.4 to simulate reperfusion. pH(i) began to increase, blebbing accelerated, and myocytes hypercontracted. As pH(i) increased, viability was lost. The same occurred if pH was increased but metabolic inhibitors were not removed. Monensin, a Na+-H+ ionophore, accelerated the increase of pH after reperfusion and hastened cell killing. Hypercontraction, blebbing, and loss of viability did not occur when inhibitors were removed at pH 6.2 or in the presence of dimethylamiloride, an inhibitor of Na+-H+ exchange. Protection was associated with maintenance of an acidotic pH(i). Free Ca2+ progressively increased during simulated ischemia. After simulated reperfusion, free Ca2+ increased further. When Ca2+ was excluded from the reperfusate, free Ca2+ increased transiently and then began to fall, but lethal reperfusion injury still occurred. If inhibitors were removed at pH 6.2, free Ca2+ remained elevated, but cells did not die. We conclude that return of pH(i) to physiological levels during reperfusion precipitates lethal cell injury. Reperfusion injury does not appear to be triggered by Ca2+ overload.", "ISSN": "0002-9513", "pub": "AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY", "volume": "265", "authors": ["BOND, JM", "CHACON, E", "HERMAN, B", "LEMASTERS, JJ"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "C129-C137"}, {"DOI": "10.1113/jphysiol.2004.072033", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "OCT 15 2004", "title": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia enhances cat chemosensory and ventilatory responses to hypoxia", "abstract": "The carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors may play an important role in the enhanced hypoxic ventilatory response induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). We studied the effects of cyclic hypoxic episodes of short duration on cat cardiorespiratory reflexes, heart rate variability, and CB chemosensory activity. Cats were exposed to cyclic hypoxic episodes (Po-2 similar to 75 Torr) repeated during 8 h for 2-4 days. Cats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (40 mg kg(-1) (I.P.,) followed by 8-12 mg (I.V.)), and ventilatory and cardiovascular responses to NaCN (0.1-100 pg kg(-1) (I.V.)) and several isocapnic levels of oxygen (Po-2 similar to 20-740 Torr) were studied. After studying the reflex responses, we recorded the CB chemosensory responses induced by the same stimuli. Results showed that CHI for 4 days selectively enhanced cat CB ventilatory (V-T and V-I) responses to hypoxia, while responses to NaCN remained largely unchanged. Similarly, basal CB discharges and responses to acute hypoxia (PO2 < 100 Torr) were larger in CIH than in control cats, without modification of the responses to NaCN. Exposure to CIH did not increase basal arterial pressure, heart rate, or their changes induced by acute hypoxia or hyperoxia. However, the spectral analysis of heart rate variability of CIH cats showed a marked increase of the low-/high-frequency ratio and an increase of the power spectral distribution of low frequencies of heart rate variability. Thus, the enhanced CB reactivity to hypoxia may contribute to the augmented ventilatory response to hypoxia, as well as to modified heart rate variability due to early changes in autonomic activity.", "ISSN": "0022-3751", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON", "volume": "560", "authors": ["Rey, S", "Del Rio, R", "Alcayaga, J", "Iturriaga, R"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/maintenance/?DOI=10.1113/jphysiol.2004.072033", "issue": "2", "pages": "577-586"}, {"DOI": "10.1172/JCI114235", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "SEP 1989", "title": "EXTRACELLULAR PROTONS ACIDIFY OSTEOCLASTS, REDUCE CYTOSOLIC CALCIUM, AND PROMOTE EXPRESSION OF CELL-MATRIX ATTACHMENT STRUCTURES", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0021-9738", "pub": "JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION", "volume": "84", "authors": ["TETI, A", "BLAIR, HC", "SCHLESINGER, P", "GRANO, M", "ZAMBONINZALLONE, A", "KAHN, AJ", "TEITELBAUM, SL", "HRUSKA, KA"], "DOIlink": "http://www.jci.org/articles/view/114235", "issue": "3", "pages": "773-780"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 1943", "title": "The effect of narcotics on the balance between central and chemoreceptor control of respiration", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-3565", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS", "volume": "77", "authors": ["Dripps, RD", "Dumke, PR"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "290-300"}]], [{"formation_energy_per_atom": -1.83964674996, "band_gap": 2.1309, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

However, the effects of this drug on parameters of microvascular flow in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have not been completely evaluated.\n\nMETHODS: Ninety-two patients presenting with STEMI where randomized to a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg) or ticagrelor (180 mg) before undergoing primary angioplasty. We assessed angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters of myocardial reperfusion. Blinded operators calculated angiographic corrected TIMI Frame count (cTFC) and myocardial blush grade (MBG) before and after stent implantation. ST segment resolution was also measured in all patients. Primary endpoint was cTFC after PCI. Secondary endpoints were cTFC prior to PCI, TIMI flow grade, MBG and the percentage of ST resolution.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 92 randomized patients, 70 patients were analyzed. Mean age of patients was 58.8\u00b110 years. Patients presented with a mean ischemic time of 4.4\u00b12.6 hours. There were no significant differences in the time between loading dose and stent deployment (35.2\u00b136.4 in ticagrelor and 42.7\u00b129.5 min in clopidogrel, p=0.36). cTFC before angioplasty was significantly lower in ticagrelor than in clopidogrel (81.1\u00b129.4 vs. 95.1\u00b117.5 frames respectively, p=0.01). After angioplasty there were no differences between ticagrelor and clopidogrel in cTFC (24.6\u00b19.3 vs. 27.0\u00b113.4 frames respectively, p=0.62); MBG grade 3 was present in 76.4 vs. 69.4% of patients, respectively (p=0.41). The percentage of ST resolution did not show any differences between groups (84.8\u00b123.4 in ticagrelor vs. 70.8\u00b133.7 in clopidogrel, p=0.36).\n\nCONCLUSION: Compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor loading in patients presenting with STEMI is not associated with an improvement of angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters of myocardial reperfusion after angioplasty.

Use of enoxaparin during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) can also improve the outcome. Administration of ticlopidine and aspirin for a few days before PCI decreases frequency of ischaemic complications. There is lack of data about safety and efficacy of combined administration of enoxaparin, ticlo-pidine and aspirin during PCI.\n\nMETHODS: 61 patients with coronary artery disease were involved in the study. All patients were pretreated with aspirin (75-325 mg/d) and ticlopidine (2 x 250 mg) for at least 3 days before PCI. PCI procedures were conducted after i.v. administration of 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin. After PCI bleeding and ischaemic complications were monitored.\n\nRESULTS: In the treated group, no major bleeding occurred, while minor bleeding was noted in 6.5% of patients. No periprocedural major adverse cardiac events (death, Q wave infarction, urgent revascularisation) were observed.

For a particular size n, the measured valence electronic transitions of all these systems fall into either one of two categories, reflecting the influence of the different oxidation states of the lanthanide atoms involved. In one, the spectra of YbSin- and EuSin- are nearly identical to each other, while in the other the spectra of GdSin-, HOSin-, and PrSin- are essentially identical. SMSin- clusters exhibit an intermediate behavior with smaller clusters resembling the former category and larger clusters resembling the latter category. In the intermediate size range, 7 <= n <= 10, for SMSin- both categories appear to be present, with one matching the EuSin--Iike systems and the other HoSin--like clusters. The distinction between LnSin- categories strongly correlates with the oxidation state of the particular lanthanide as usually found in its compounds. On the basis of this observation, we conclude that, among the Ln-silicon clusters studied herein, Yb, Eu, and in case of Sm, sizes n >= 10, adopt a nominal +2 oxidation state while Ho, Pr, Gd, and in case of Sm, sizes n <= 7, exhibit a nominal +3 oxidation state. Furthermore, dramatic increases in adiabatic electron affinity values observed at n = 10 for the Ln(III)Si(n) series and at n = 12 for the Ln(II)Si(n) series were attributed to an inherent electronic stabilization of those particular clusters, rather than to the lanthanides' encapsulation. The observed limited effect of f-electrons on the valence electronic structure and thus on bonding in LnSin- clusters may leave these electrons available for inducing magnetism.

The films are prepared by self-assembly from aqueous colloids of chemically exfoliated GO onto substrates of different nature: Al2O3; MgO; ZnO; Si; GdSi (42% Si) powders fumed silica and a Si plate containing surface nanostructured Si layer. The procedure works on both planar and high surface area substrates. It was found by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photon spectroscopy analysis that the chemical nature of substrate surface, in particular its basicity, determines the structure and particles orientation of the GO layer whose thickness increases with an increase of GO concentration in the starting suspension. Thermal treatment of the GO films leads to GO decomposition and the formation of supported carbon films. The GO deposition has been shown to increase 8-30 times the adsorption capacity of the substrates toward Cu(II) amino complexes. The GO film adsorption capacity can be controlled by varying GO concentration of the starting suspension. The maximum GO adsorption capacity (24 mmol g(-1)) is observed for the samples which were prepared using the suspensions with GO concentration of 0.3-0.4 gl (-1), and is close to the total quantity of oxygen-containing groups in GO.

The electronic conductance in quantum wires, however, is often dictated by structural instabilities and electron localization at the atomic scale. Here we report on the evolutions of electronic transport as a function of temperature and interwire coupling as the quantum wires of GdSi2 are self-assembled on Si(100) wire-by-wire. The correlation between structure, electronic properties, and electronic transport are examined by combining nanotransport measurements, scanning tunneling microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. A metal-insulator transition is revealed in isolated nanowires, while a robust metallic state is obtained in wire bundles at low temperature. The atomic defects lead to electron localizations in isolated nanowire, and interwire coupling stabilizes the structure and promotes the metallic states in wire bundles.

The results indicate that the morphology of the primary Mg2Si is changed from coarse dendrite into fine polygon with the increasing Gd content. The average size of the primary Mg2Si significantly decreases with increasing Gd content up to 1.0 wt.%, and then slowly increases. Interestingly, when the Gd content is increased to 4.0 and 8.0 wt.%, the primary and eutectic Mg2Si evidently decrease and even disappear. The modification and refinement of the primary Mg2Si is mainly attributed to the poisoning effect. The GdMg2 phase in the primary Mg2Si is obviously coarsened as the Gd content exceeds 2.0 wt.%. While the decrease and disappearance of the primary and eutectic Mg2Si are ascribed to the formation of vast GdSi compound. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that proper Gd (1.0 wt.%) addition can effectively modify and refine the primary Mg2Si. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In materials that have significant localized and itinerant spins, it is not obvious which will induce order. We combine electrical transport, X-ray magnetic diffraction, and photoemission studies with band structure calculations to characterize successive anti-ferromagnetic transitions in GdSi. GdSi has both sizable local moments and a partially nested Fermi surface, without confounding contributions from orbital effects. We identify a route to incommensurate order where neither type of moment dominates, but is rooted in cooperative feedback between them. The nested Fermi surface of the itinerant electrons induces strong interactions between local moments at the nesting vector, whereas the ordered local moments in turn provide the necessary coupling for a spin-density wave to form among the itinerant electrons. This mechanism echoes the cooperative interactions between electrons and ions in charge-density-wave materials, and should be germane across a spectrum of transition-metal and rare-earth intermetallic compounds.", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "pub": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "volume": "110", "authors": ["Feng, YJ", "Wang, JY", "Silevitch, DM", "Mihaila, B", "Kim, JW", "Yan, JQ", "Schulze, RK", "Woo, N", "Palmer, A", "Ren, Y", "van Wezel, J", "Littlewood, PB", "Rosenbaum, TF"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1217292110", "issue": "9", "pages": "3287-3292"}, {"DOI": "10.1002/anie.201003490", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2010", "title": "Unusual Silicon Connectivities in the Binary Compounds GdSi5, CeSi5, and Ce2Si7", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "1433-7851", "pub": "ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION", "volume": "49", "authors": ["Wosylus, A", "Meier, K", "Prots, Y", "Schnelle, W", "Rosner, H", "Schwarz, U", "Grin, Y"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/maintenance/?DOI=10.1002/anie.201003490", "issue": "47", "pages": "9002-9006"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/s10008-002-0310-7", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10008-002-0310-7.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2003", "title": "Features of behavior of solid-state CO2 sensors at low temperatures", "abstract": "The dependence of the impedance of low-temperature sensors for carbon dioxide based on the solid-state electrochemical cells Na0.5WO3/Na5GdSi4O12/SnO2(Sb2O4) on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air was studied.

In the case of Gd-silicide, an orthorhombic GdSi2 phase exists at high temperature; the transition temperature is related to the thickness and crystalline quality of the silicide. In the case of the lightest rare-earth metals, such as Nd, silicides only exist in a tetragonal or orthorhombic phase, which cannot grow epitaxially on Si(111). However, introduction of a fraction of yttrium (YSi1.7 also possesses the aforementioned hexagonal lattice) drives the Nd-Si system into a hexagonal lattice structure. A combined backscattering and channeling spectrometry (RBS/C), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study shows that an epitaxial, continuous ternary silicide is formed land not a mixture of binaries) with a hexagonal structure, which is stable up to 950 degrees C. Further annealing, however, results in a gradual transformation into polycrystalline phases. The experimental results are compared to total energy calculations of these (meta-)stable rare-earth silicides, using the density functional theory (DFT). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
