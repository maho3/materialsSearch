Such studies have been performed extensively on graphite, transition-metal dichalcogenides and oxide bronzes(1). Interest in redox intercalation reactions(2) has increased recently because the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors based on copper oxide also have layered structures, the superconductivity occurring within two-dimensional CuO2 planes separated by charge-reservoir oxide layers(3). Similarly, in metal-doped fullerenes, which show relatively high transition temperatures, the electron donor atoms sit in the interstitial sites between adjacent fullerene balls(4). In a previous study(5), we described a layered nitride, beta-ZrNCl, consisting of Zr-N double layers sandwiched between two close-packed chlorine layers. On lithium intercalation, the crystal changed from a semiconductor to a metal, and became a superconductor at 13 K. Here we report the properties of the isostructural compound beta-HfNCl. After electron-doping the crystal by lithium intercalation, we observe superconductivity with a T-c of up to 25.5 K. This transition temperature is higher than that observed in any intermetallic compound, and suggests that layered nitride structures may offer transition temperatures comparable to those observed in layered copper oxide structures.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "392", "authors": ["Yamanaka, S", "Hotehama, K", "Kawaji, H"], "issue": "6676", "pages": "580-582"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/NMAT2587", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/nmat/journal/v9/n2/extref/nmat2587-s1.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2010", "title": "Liquid-gated interface superconductivity on an atomically flat film", "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT2587", "abstract": "Liquid/solid interfaces are attracting growing interest not only for applications in catalytic activities and energy storage(1,2), but also for their new electronic functions in electric double-layer transistors (EDLTs) exemplified by high-performance organic electronics(3-7), field-induced electronic phase transitions(8-11), as well as superconductivity in SrTiO(3) (ref. 12). Broadening EDLTs to induce superconductivity within other materials is highly demanded for enriching the materials science of superconductors. However, it is severely hampered by inadequate choice of materials and processing techniques(13). Here we introduce an easy method using ionic liquids as gate dielectrics, mechanical micro-cleavage techniques for surface preparation, and report the observation of field-induced superconductivity showing a transition temperature T(c) = 15.2 K on an atomically flat film of layered nitride compound, ZrNCl.

Polar solvent molecules such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, and propylene;carbonate were co-intercalated with the alkali metals, expanding the interlayer spacing. The T-c was dependent solely on the amount of intercalated alkali metals, or the doping level; the kind of intercalated alkali metals and the interlayer separation were not influential to the T-c. Although beta-ZrNCl is a semiconductor, only a small amount of doping of alkali metals was necessary for the superconductivity.

The recent finding of superconductivity below 26 K in some intercalated beta-HfNCl phases suggests that high transition temperatures might be achievable in compounds with triangular or graphite-like nets as well. Here we present key features of high level ab initio band structure calculations on the insulating ZrNCl and HfNCl parent compounds.

The structural and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a combination of resonant valence bond and excitonic insulator physics, and incorporating boson-fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different fashion, the latter leads to some similarities with the high temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The excitonic insulator behaviour sees spin density wave, charge density wave/periodic structural distortion, and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour.

Whereas several samples of beta-ZrNBr and beta-ZrNCl showed reproducibility in the lithium uptake and in the corresponding critical temperatures, different samples of beta-HFNCl subjected to the same treatment in n-buthyllithium showed lithium uptakes ranging from 0.07 to 0.67, and corresponding critical temperatures between 0 and 24 K. A linear dependence of T-c versus the lithium content is observed when all the superconducting samples are considered.

The pristine compound is a band insulator with the BiS2 layer, which accommodates electron carriers through the La substitution for Sr, as evidenced by the change in x-ray absorption spectra reflecting the occupancy of Bi 6p orbitals. With increasing the carrier density, the resistivity progressively decreases and a bad metallic state appears for x >= 0.45, where bulk superconductivity manifests itself below approximately 3K. The value of T-c gradually increases with decreasing x from 0.6 to 0.45 and immediately decreases down to zero at the critical concentration of x similar to 0.4, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition highly sensitive to the carrier density. Thermodynamic measurements furthermore have revealed the possible enhancement of the superconducting coupling strength as the insulating phase is approached. The obtained superconducting phase diagram is markedly different from the broad dome-shaped superconducting phase previously reported for RO1-xFxBiS2 (R: rare-earth ion), suggesting a strong influence of the blocking layer on the superconductivity. Instead all these features are similar to those observed in Li-intercalated ZrNCl superconductor, except for the critical electron concentration of as low as 6% in the latter compound.

Such studies have been performed extensively on graphite, transition-metal dichalcogenides and oxide bronzes(1). Interest in redox intercalation reactions(2) has increased recently because the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors based on copper oxide also have layered structures, the superconductivity occurring within two-dimensional CuO2 planes separated by charge-reservoir oxide layers(3). Similarly, in metal-doped fullerenes, which show relatively high transition temperatures, the electron donor atoms sit in the interstitial sites between adjacent fullerene balls(4). In a previous study(5), we described a layered nitride, beta-ZrNCl, consisting of Zr-N double layers sandwiched between two close-packed chlorine layers. On lithium intercalation, the crystal changed from a semiconductor to a metal, and became a superconductor at 13 K. Here we report the properties of the isostructural compound beta-HfNCl. After electron-doping the crystal by lithium intercalation, we observe superconductivity with a T-c of up to 25.5 K.

The structural and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a combination of resonant valence bond and excitonic insulator physics, and incorporating boson-fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different fashion, the latter leads to some similarities with the high temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The excitonic insulator behaviour sees spin density wave, charge density wave/periodic structural distortion, and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural form which it can engender.

Whereas several samples of beta-ZrNBr and beta-ZrNCl showed reproducibility in the lithium uptake and in the corresponding critical temperatures, different samples of beta-HFNCl subjected to the same treatment in n-buthyllithium showed lithium uptakes ranging from 0.07 to 0.67, and corresponding critical temperatures between 0 and 24 K. A linear dependence of T-c versus the lithium content is observed when all the superconducting samples are considered.

The pristine compound is a band insulator with the BiS2 layer, which accommodates electron carriers through the La substitution for Sr, as evidenced by the change in x-ray absorption spectra reflecting the occupancy of Bi 6p orbitals. With increasing the carrier density, the resistivity progressively decreases and a bad metallic state appears for x >= 0.45, where bulk superconductivity manifests itself below approximately 3K. The value of T-c gradually increases with decreasing x from 0.6 to 0.45 and immediately decreases down to zero at the critical concentration of x similar to 0.4, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition highly sensitive to the carrier density. Thermodynamic measurements furthermore have revealed the possible enhancement of the superconducting coupling strength as the insulating phase is approached. The obtained superconducting phase diagram is markedly different from the broad dome-shaped superconducting phase previously reported for RO1-xFxBiS2 (R: rare-earth ion), suggesting a strong influence of the blocking layer on the superconductivity. Instead all these features are similar to those observed in Li-intercalated ZrNCl superconductor, except for the critical electron concentration of as low as 6% in the latter compound.

Linear relations between the enthalpy DeltaH(ox) and nitrogen content were found in all oxynitrides. They indicate that, within the experimental range of nitrogen concentrations, sites occupied by nitrogen ions are energetically equivalent in a given substitutional series. The enthalpies normalized per mole of nitrogen, DeltaH(ox)(n), for compounds of Y-Zr-N-O, Ca-Zr-N-O, and Zr-N-O are similar, about -500 kJ/(mol of N). A more exothermic value of DeltaH(ox)(n), of about -950 kJ/(mol of N), is seen in Mg-Zr-N-O compounds.
