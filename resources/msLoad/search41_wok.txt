Laboratory bench-scale mixing experiments were carried out in both Cr(VI)-bearing artificial solutions and industrial wastewaters under controlled conditions. The effects of solution pH, Cr(VI) concentration, mineral grain size, mineral/solution ratio, and reaction time on the Cr(VI) removal were studied. Chromium was effectively removed from the solutions and wastewaters. After the treatment, the liquid was clean enough to be discharged directly into the natural environment. The Cr(VI) removal process involved sequentially the adsorption of Cr(VI), in the form of Cr2O72- or CrO42-, onto the mineral surface, the reduction of the adsorbed Cr(VI) to Cr(III), catalyzed at the vacant Fe sites of the mineral, and finally the precipitation of Cr(III) as Cr2S3, Cr2O3, and Cr(OH)3 solid phases. Conditions such as a fine mineral grain size, an excessive quantity of clino-pyrrhotite and a weak acidic media, favored the removal process. For clino-pyrrhotite with a restricted grain size, the minimum required quantity of the mineral was proportional to the total quantity of Cr(VI) to be removed. Quantitatively, one cubic meter of industrial wastewater that contained similar to 1 mmol dm(-3) of Cr(VI) and had a pH value between 1 and 10 would be effectively treated after it was in contact with 220 kg of 145 +/- 28 mu m clinopyrrhotite for an hour. Furthermore, the quantity of the final solid waste byproduct was small, and the solid residue of clino-pyrrhotite could be reused after a simple rinse with water. Compared to the previous Cr(VI)-bearing wastewater treatment schemes, this method was simple, effective, economical, and environmentally sound.

Empirical volcano curves can be explained by microkinetic models including chemical descriptors calculated at an ab initio level. This approach was successfully applied in the field of hydrotreating catalysis using the metal-sulfur bond energy descriptor. The purpose of the present work was to extend this approach by exploring the effect of reaction conditions (partial pressure of H2S) on the volcano curve. On the one hand, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images combined with molecular modeling of morphologies and surfaces exposed by catalysts provide an estimate of the number of potential active sites. This approach is illustrated for the relevant case of unsupported or alumina supported Co9S8 sulfide. On the other hand, an improved microkinetic model is proposed in order to reflect the dual effects of H2S observed in the hydrogenation of toluene : an inhibiting effect for MoS2, Rh2S3, RuS2, NiMoS and a promoting effect for Cr2S3 et Co9S8.

Niobium, molybdenum and tantalum are highly resistant to sulfide corrosion. Their sulfidation resistance is further enhanced by alloying with aluminum. Although Cr-refractory metal alloys also reveal high sulfidation resistance, their sulfidation rates do not become lower than those of the corresponding refractory metals. The sulfide scales formed on the Al-refractory metal and Cr-refractory metal alloys consist of two layers., comprising an outer Al2S3 or Cr2S3 layer and an inner refractory metal disulfide layer. The inner layer has a columnar structure, and the growth direction of the refractory metal disulfides is perpendicular to 001 direction. Intercalation of Al3+ ions into NbS2 and a decrease in the sulfur activity at the outer layer/inner layer interface by the presence of the Al2S3 layer are probably responsible for the improvement of the sulfidation resistance by the addition of aluminum. The oxidation resistance of niobium and tantalum is improved more effectively by the addition of chromium rather than aluminum. Although preferential oxidation of chromium does not occur, an outer protective Cr2O3 layer in the oxide scales is formed on Cr-rich Cr-Nb and Cr-Ta alloys due to outward diffusion of Cr3+ ions. In contrast, continuous alumina layer cannot be formed on the Al-Nb and Al-Ta alloys, and the alloys reveal a pest phenomenon at 1073 K, and at higher temperatures rapid oxidation occurs. Concerning the oxidation of molybdenum, the addition of aluminum, which has higher activity for oxidation than chromium, is more effective in improving the oxidation resistance of molybdenum than chromium addition, since preferential oxidation of aluminum suppresses the formation of volatile molybdenum oxide.

This original method permitted us a better understanding of these relatively poorly documented catalytic systems. Experiences confirmed that, in a first step, for temperatures inferior to 400degreesC, CrS., species are progressively formed. Then, in a second step for a temperature near 400 degreesC, formation of Cr2S3 entities is achieved, leading to their decomposition into CrS. This showed that the catalytic phase morphology depends drastically on the sulfidation temperature. Moreover, it was found that the increase in DBT activity with the Cr content previously observed was due to a modification of the nature of the active phase and not to an increase in its quantity. Indeed, whilst the sulfur quantity that accumulated on the catalysts containing 11.1 and 22.2 wt.% CrO3 was almost the same, the DBT HDS activity of the latter was similar to50% higher.

The sulfidation and oxidation behavior of the alloys has been studied as a function of temperature in sulfur vapor pressure of 10(3) Pa and in oxygen of 2 x 10(4) Pa, respectively. The sulfidation of these alloys generally follows a parabolic rate law, being thus diffusion controlled. The sulfidation rates of Al-refractory metal and Cr-refractory metal alloys are several orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional high temperature alloys and comparable to or even lower than those of the corresponding refractory metals. The sulfide scales formed on these alloys consist of two layers, comprising an outer Al2S3 or Cr2S3 layer and an inner refractory metal disulfide layer. The formation of the inner layer is attributed to the excellent sulfidation resistance of these alloys. The oxidation resistance of Al-refractory metal alloys is not sufficiently high, but the addition of silicon improves remarkably their oxidation resistance by synergistic effect of aluminum and silicon. Although the Cr-Mo alloys possess poor oxidation resistance, due to the formation of volatile molybdenum oxide, the oxidation resistance of the Cr-Nb and Cr-Ta alloys is as high as that of typical chromia-forming alloys.

Sulphidation attack is particularly severe in environments of low oxygen (P-O2 similar to 10(-18) Pa) and high sulphur (p(S2) similar to 10(-1)-(10-3) Pa) potentials at temperatures above 700 degrees C. Recognizing that refractory metals have a high resistance to sulphidation in reducing environments, their use as overlay coatings in sulphur-containing environments deserves serious consideration. In the adoption of such an approach, Mo has been recognized as a highly sulphidation-resistant metal with a Kp value of 10(-12) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) in an atmosphere of p(S2) similar to 10(-1) Pa at 750 degrees C.\n\nIn this study, Mo was deposited on two superalloys, Inconel 600 and Nimonic PE11, using air plasma spraying. The coated specimens were tested at 750 degrees C for up to 168 h in an environment comprising p(S2) similar to 10(-1) Pa and p(O2) similar to 10(-18) Pa. The sulphidation kinetics (this is not real through-layer kinetics, since the specimens had open edges) were determined by a discontinuous gravimetric method. The exposed samples were characterized and analysed using SEM, EDX and XRD techniques. For uncoated Inconel 600, a duplex scale was formed which consisted of an outer Ni3S2 layer and an inner Cr2S3 layer. The scale developed on uncoated Nimonic PE11 comprised three sub-scale layers - an outer (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 layer, a mid Cr2S3 layer and an inner MoS2 layer. However, after prolonged exposure, the outer layer contained both (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 and Ni3S2 on the surface of the uncoated Nimonic PE11.\n\nThe kinetics results demonstrated that Mo coating enhanced the corrosion resistance of both alloys, and particularly so for Nimonic PE11. For both substrates, Mo coating led to the development of two sub-scale layers at the early stages of exposure (e.g. up to 5 h). The outer layer consisted of Ni3S2 for Inconel 600 and (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 for Nimonic PE11. A MoS2 layer constituted the inner layer for both materials. After prolonged sulphidation, a Cr2S3 layer gradually developed between the outer layer and the inner MoS, layer.

This paper reports the effect of yttrium, aluminium and yttrium plus aluminium addition on the sulphidation behaviour of an Fe-20Cr alloy in H(2)-2%H(2)S at 700 and 800 degrees C. The effect of preoxidation of these alloys on sulphidation behaviour was also investigated. The initial stages of sulphidation of these alloys were observed and overall sulphidation kinetics was determined. In the presence of yttrium, the sulphidation rate of the alloy decreased by an order of magnitude, and the sulphide layer on the FeCrY alloy was significantly thinner than that formed on the FeCr alloy. Aluminium addition increased sulphidation resistance even more. The FeCrAl and FeCrAlY alloys exhibited parabolic sulphidation kinetics at the two temperatures. On both alloys, initial chromium sulphide (Cr(2)S(3)) formation at grain boundaries and Al(2)S(3) and FeCr(2)S(4) formation over the grains was followed by formation of an outer Cr2S3 layer over a mixed sulphide layer. Preoxidation of the two alloys resulted in an 'incubation period' with practically no sulphidation during subsequent exposure to S bearing environments. After this incubation period, the sulphidation behaviour of the FeCr alloy was similar to that when the alloy was not preoxidised. The incubation period of the FeCrAl alloy was significantly longer, over 45 h, compared with 2 h for the Al free alloy.

At the same time in the presence of chromium, the synergy of catalytic activity between Ni and Mo in the reaction of HDS of thiophene was lowered, apparently because of hindering of formation of mixed sulfide Ni-Mo-S active sites due to the stronger interaction between Ni and Cr species than that of Ni and Mo.", "ISSN": "1011-372X", "pub": "CATALYSIS LETTERS", "volume": "55", "authors": ["Thiollier, A", "Afanasiev, P", "Cattenot, M", "Vrinat, M"], "issue": "1", "pages": "39-45"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-5088(90)90308-7", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022508890903087/pdf?md5=586dd5f2de8da9a4f6d00692a701bee1&pid=1-s2.0-0022508890903087-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 1990", "title": "THE SYSTEM NIS-CR2S3-IN2S3", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022508890903087", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-5088", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE LESS-COMMON METALS", "volume": "161", "authors": ["SCHMIDT, T", "LUTZ, HD"], "issue": "1", "pages": "7-16"}, {"DOI": "10.1143/JPSJ.39.647", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1975", "title": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF RHOMBOHEDRAL CR2S3 SINGLE-CRYSTAL .2.

The results showed that the corrosion kinetics followed the parabolic rate law in all cases. The parabolic rate constants decreased with decreasing temperature, but fluctuated with increasing Cr-content. It was found that Fe-28Al-5Cr revealed the best performance to improve the corrosion resistance compared with Fe-28Al in the ternary alloys studied. The Fe-28Al-10Cr alloy showed poor corrosion resistance, and whose corrosion rates were only slightly lower than those of Fe-28Al and much higher than those of low-Cr alloys. The addition of Y did not provide any significant reduction in the corrosion rates as compared with those of Fe-28Al-5Cr at T less than or equal to 800 degreesC. The scales formed on Fe-28Al-xCr were strongly dependent on temperature and Cr-content, consisting of most Al2O3, some FeS, and minor Cr2S3/Cr3S4 (for 2Cr- and 5Cr-content alloys) and of most FeS, minor amounts of Cr2S3/Cr3S4 and Al2O3 (for Fe-28Al-10Cr). The scales formed on the Y-containing alloy were nearly identical to those of Fe-28Al-5Cr. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The energies of the transversal and longitudinal optic phonon modes were determined from dielectric dispersion relations epsilon \" and -Im(1/epsilon), respectively, via Kramers Kronig analyses. The highest-energy phonon mode exhibits one-mode behaviour whereas the three low-energy phonons reveal two-mode behaviour in contrast to M1-xMx'CoCr2S4 spinel-type solid solutions (with M and M' bivalent metal atoms at the tetrahedral 8a site), which mainly display one-mode behaviour. This different behaviour of CoCr2-xIn2xS4 solid solutions is owing to the change of the metal atom distribution mentioned above in addition to the different masses of the atoms involved. The one-mode behaviour of the highest-energy phonon mode at 389 and 401 cm(-1) (CoCr2S4) and at 323 and 350 cm(-1) (CoIn2S4) is due to the fact that in the eigenvectors of this phonon almost only motions of the nonmetal atoms are involved. The spectra of the solid solutions under investigation, which decompose on annealing at elevated temperatures to chromium and indium rich specimens, reveal further that there is a random distribution of the atoms at the octahedral 16d sites not only in the X-ray but also in the vibration spectroscopic size scale.

Many thermoelectric oxides were investigated for this purpose, but their power factor (PF) values were too small (similar to 10(-4) W m(-1) K-2) to yield a satisfactory figure of merit zT. Changing the anions from O2- to S2- and then to Se2- is a way to increase the covalency. In this review, some examples of sulfides (binary Cr-S or derived from layered TiS2) and an example of selenides, AgCrSe2, have been selected to illustrate the characteristic features of their physical properties. The comparison of the only two semiconducting binary chromium sulfides and of a layered AgCrSe2 selenide shows that the PF values are also in the same order of magnitude as those of transition metal oxides. In contrast, the PF values of the layered sulfides TiS2 and Cu0.1TiS2 are higher, reaching similar to 10(-3) W m(-1) K-2. Apparently the magnetism related to the Cr-S network is detrimental for the PF when compared to the d(0) character of the Ti4+ based sulfides. Finally, the very low PF in AgCrSe2 (PF = 2.25 x 10(-4) W m(1) K-2 at 700 K) is compensated by a very low thermal conductivity (kappa = 0.2 W m(-1) K-1 from the measured C-p) leading to the highest zT value among the reviewed compounds (zT(700 K) = 0.8). The existence of a glassy-like state for the Ag+ cations above 475 K is believed to be responsible for this result. This result demonstrates that the phonon engineering in open frameworks is a very interesting way to generate efficient thermoelectric materials.", "ISSN": "1468-6996", "pub": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS", "volume": "13", "authors": ["Maignan, A", "Guilmeau, E", "Gascoin, F", "Breard, Y", "Hardy, V"], "issue": "5", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0925-8388(98)00876-7", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838898008767/pdfft?md5=0e21007938ead2e46b3f34fff4ae0ce5&pid=1-s2.0-S0925838898008767-main.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 1 1999", "title": "Point defects in the bimetallic sulfides MCr2S4 (M=V, Fe or Mn): Comparison with CuCrS2 and the corresponding monometallic sulfides", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838898008767", "abstract": "The variations of the chemical compositions of MnS and MnCr2S4 are both very small, whereas those of FeCr2S4 are large, and those of FeS very large.

Upon Sr doping, the material segregates into hole-rich, metallic ferromagnetic regions and a hole-poor matrix similar to LaCoO3. The Co ions of the ferromagnetic phase are in intermediate-spin configurations; the hole-poor matrix experiences a thermally induced low-spin to high-spin transition. For low Sr doping (x < 0.20), the hole-rich regions are isolated from one another and show superparamagnetic behavior below T-c approximate to 240 K; long-range magnetic order via frustrated intercluster interactions occurs below a superparamagnetic freezing temperature T-g that increases with x. At x = 0.20, the coupling between the intermediate-spin, metallic ferromagnetic clusters within an interpenetrating matrix reaches a magnetic percolation threshold that orders the clusters ferromagnetically below T-c approximate to 250 K. However, the electrical conduction in the ferromagnetic regions is modulated by the matrix, which has a spin state that varies with temperature. This causes a reentrant semiconductive behavior in the samples with 0.20 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.25. Metallic ferromagnetic behavior is found for 0.30 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.50 even though the presence of an interpenetrating hole-poor matrix persists to x = 0.50. A ferromagnetic fraction less than unity leads to peculiar magnetic properties that have been attributed in the literature to a magnetic ''cluster glass.''

The ground state is found to be a nonmagnetic insulator with Co ions in a low-spin state. Somewhat higher in energy, we find two intermediate-spin states followed by a high-spin state at significantly higher energy. The calculations show that Co 3d states of t(2g) symmetry form narrow bands which could easily localize, while e(g) orbitals, due to their strong hybridization with the oxygen 2p states, form a broad sigma* band. With temperature variation which is simulated by a corresponding change of the lattice parameters, a transition from the low- to intermediate-spin state occurs. This intermediate-spin (occupation t(2g)(5)e(g)(1)) can develop an orbital ordering which can account for the nonmetallic nature of LaCoO3 at 90 K<T<500 K.

The compositions studied span the range from the end-member LaCoO3 (x=0.0) through to x=0.7. These materials have attracted attention recently, primarily due to the spin-state transition phenomena in LaCoO3 and the unusual nature of the magnetic ground state for finite x. In this paper we present a consistent picture of the magnetic behavior of La1-xSrxCoO3 in terms of short-range ferromagnetic ordering and intrinsic phase separation. At high Sr doping (x>0.2) the system exhibits unconventional ferromagnetism (with a Curie temperature up to 250 K), which is interpreted in terms of the coalescence of short-range-ordered ferromagnetic clusters. Brillouin function fits to the temperature dependence of the magnetization as well as high-temperature Curie-Weiss behavior suggest that the Co3+ and Co4+ ions are both in the intermediate spin state. At lower Sr doping (x<0.18) the system enters a mixed phase that displays the characteristics of both a spin glass and a ferromagnet. A cusp in the zero-field-cooled dc magnetization, a frequency-dependent peak in the ac susceptibility and time-dependent effects in both dc and ac magnetic properties all point towards glassy behavior. On the other hand, field cooling results in a relatively large ferromagneticlike moment, with zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetizations bifurcating at an irreversibility point. Even in the region above x=0.2 the out-of-phase component of the ac susceptibility shows frequency-dependent peaks below the Curie temperature (indicative of glassy behavior) which have previously been interpreted in terms of the freezing of clusters. All of the results are consistent with the existence of a strong tendency towards magnetic phase separation in this material, a conclusion which is further reinforced by consideration of the electronic properties. The metal-insulator transition is observed to be coincident with the onset of ferromagnetic ordering (x=0.18) and has a behavior in the doping dependence of the low-temperature conductivity which is strongly suggestive of percolation. This can be interpreted as a percolation transition within the simple ferromagnetic cluster model. On the metallic side of the transition the system exhibits colossal magnetoresistance-type behavior with a peak in the negative magnetoresistance (similar to10% in 90 kOe) in the vicinity of the Curie temperature. As the transition is approached from the metallic side we observe the onset of a negative magnetoresistance that increases in magnitude with decreasing temperature, reaching values as large as 90% in a 90-kOe field.

The results give direct evidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of the Sr2+ ions and the segregation of the material into hole-rich ferromagnetic regions and a hole-poor semiconducting matrix at lower values of x. The holes introduced by Sr doping are attracted to the Sr2+ ions where they stabilize to lowest temperatures an intermediate-spin state at neighboring trivalent cobalt.

In the present work, we extend the paramagnetic-scattering measurements up to a temperature of 700 K. We find that the magnetic-scattering intensity decreases monotonically for temperatures above 300 K, indicating that the high-temperature transition is not dominantly magnetic in origin. Furthermore, the anomalous thermal expansion associated with the low-temperature transition is measured and shown to be consistent with a simple theoretical model for the spin-state transition.

Compared to the conventional mixed electronic-ionic conductors such as LaCoO3, these LaGaO3-based oxides exhibited a lower electronic conductivity but a higher oxide ion conductivity. In particular, Fe-doped LaGaO3 exhibited a high oxygen permeation rate and a stability against reduction. Consequently, higher CH, conversion in the partial oxidation of CH, was attained by using La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.6Fe0.4O3 in the place of the conventional candidate material of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 for the oxygen permeation membrane. As a result, this study revealed that LaGaO3-based oxide doped with Fe, Co or Ni for Ga site is a new family of mixed electronic-oxide ionic conductors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A simple flow-through reactor has been used to study the combustion of methane between room temperature and 1100 degrees C. Using a gel-type precipitation method it has been proved possible to synthesise a single phase perovskite material with a bulk La:Co metal atom ratio of 1:1.1. PXRD, Rietveld analysis and density measurements show that the perovskite phase is nonstoichiometric with a deficiency of lanthanum ions in the lattice. This material is rather ineffective as a catalytic material. A more active form can be prepared at a La:Co metal atom ratio of 1:1 when a mixed phase (perovskite/lanthana) is produced. This material exhibits both higher activity to methane combustion and the storage/evolution of oxygen (as measured using DSC and TPD techniques).\n\nThe results of activity tests have been rationalised using XPS where large amounts of O- species are seen at the surface. It is proposed that these ions occupy anion vacancies created to compensate for the reduced cation charge in the lattice. This is not possible for the single phase material where vacancies are compensated for by the presence of valency changes of cobalt and/or oxygen.\n\nFurther work has been carried by doping of the perovskite with cations of valencies +2, +3 and +4 in an attempt to control the non-stoichiometry. In this way, it has been proved possible to provide simple synthetic routes to active methane combustion catalysts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Five LaCoO3 Samples were prepared by different methods: solid state (SS), coprecipitation (COP), citrate complexation (CIT) and reactive grinding of the single oxides (RG) and of an amorphous precursor (COPRG). TPD-O-2 experiments showed three kinds of oxygen. First, two surface oxygen species (designated as alpha-oxygens) were distinguished. The amounts of oxygen desorbing in the two alpha-oxygen desorption peaks were found to be mainly dependant on the specific surface area of the samples and stay lower than one monolayer (0.7-0.8). The last desorption peak, which is generally attributed to the desorption of some lattice oxygens (beta-oxygens), was found to be more dependant on the morphology of the sample. H-2 reduction experiments (TPR-H-2) showed the usual two-step reduction. The reduction temperatures were found. to be directly related to the calcination temperatures. H-2 uptakes and XRD analysis suggest a reduction of slightly more than one e(-) in the first step and the formation of some Coo before the beginning of the second reduction step. Kinetic analysis for the CH4 oxidation reaction showed that the specific reaction rate is significantly affected by the synthesis procedure. Grinding an amorphous precursor results in a perovskite which combines a high specific surface area (made possible by the use of grinding) and a high activity. The RG sample presents a lower activity than COPRG, due to a higher iron contamination. Nevertheless, the differences observed in the oxidation reaction rate could not be correlated to the redox properties, measured by TPD-O-2 and TPR-H-2, of the catalysts. Then, these methods, are not adequate to evaluate the reactivity of the solids. When tested in the CO oxidation reaction, the samples present different comportments than in the CH4 oxidation reaction. These differences are discussed on the basis of the oxidation mechanisms involved in the two reactions.

The low-temperature Curie-Weiss paramagnetic susceptibility of LCoO3 is an intrinsic property arising from surface cobalt and, possibly, a LS ground state bearing some IS character caused by the virtual excitation to the IS state. The transition from a LS to a IS/HS state introduces bond-length fluctuations that suppress the phonon contribution to kappa(T) below 300 K.

Laboratory bench-scale mixing experiments were carried out in both Cr(VI)-bearing artificial solutions and industrial wastewaters under controlled conditions. The effects of solution pH, Cr(VI) concentration, mineral grain size, mineral/solution ratio, and reaction time on the Cr(VI) removal were studied. Chromium was effectively removed from the solutions and wastewaters. After the treatment, the liquid was clean enough to be discharged directly into the natural environment. The Cr(VI) removal process involved sequentially the adsorption of Cr(VI), in the form of Cr2O72- or CrO42-, onto the mineral surface, the reduction of the adsorbed Cr(VI) to Cr(III), catalyzed at the vacant Fe sites of the mineral, and finally the precipitation of Cr(III) as Cr2S3, Cr2O3, and Cr(OH)3 solid phases. Conditions such as a fine mineral grain size, an excessive quantity of clino-pyrrhotite and a weak acidic media, favored the removal process. For clino-pyrrhotite with a restricted grain size, the minimum required quantity of the mineral was proportional to the total quantity of Cr(VI) to be removed. Quantitatively, one cubic meter of industrial wastewater that contained similar to 1 mmol dm(-3) of Cr(VI) and had a pH value between 1 and 10 would be effectively treated after it was in contact with 220 kg of 145 +/- 28 mu m clinopyrrhotite for an hour. Furthermore, the quantity of the final solid waste byproduct was small, and the solid residue of clino-pyrrhotite could be reused after a simple rinse with water. Compared to the previous Cr(VI)-bearing wastewater treatment schemes, this method was simple, effective, economical, and environmentally sound.

The purpose of the present work was to extend this approach by exploring the effect of reaction conditions (partial pressure of H2S) on the volcano curve. On the one hand, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images combined with molecular modeling of morphologies and surfaces exposed by catalysts provide an estimate of the number of potential active sites. This approach is illustrated for the relevant case of unsupported or alumina supported Co9S8 sulfide. On the other hand, an improved microkinetic model is proposed in order to reflect the dual effects of H2S observed in the hydrogenation of toluene : an inhibiting effect for MoS2, Rh2S3, RuS2, NiMoS and a promoting effect for Cr2S3 et Co9S8.

Niobium, molybdenum and tantalum are highly resistant to sulfide corrosion. Their sulfidation resistance is further enhanced by alloying with aluminum. Although Cr-refractory metal alloys also reveal high sulfidation resistance, their sulfidation rates do not become lower than those of the corresponding refractory metals. The sulfide scales formed on the Al-refractory metal and Cr-refractory metal alloys consist of two layers., comprising an outer Al2S3 or Cr2S3 layer and an inner refractory metal disulfide layer. The inner layer has a columnar structure, and the growth direction of the refractory metal disulfides is perpendicular to 001 direction. Intercalation of Al3+ ions into NbS2 and a decrease in the sulfur activity at the outer layer/inner layer interface by the presence of the Al2S3 layer are probably responsible for the improvement of the sulfidation resistance by the addition of aluminum. The oxidation resistance of niobium and tantalum is improved more effectively by the addition of chromium rather than aluminum. Although preferential oxidation of chromium does not occur, an outer protective Cr2O3 layer in the oxide scales is formed on Cr-rich Cr-Nb and Cr-Ta alloys due to outward diffusion of Cr3+ ions. In contrast, continuous alumina layer cannot be formed on the Al-Nb and Al-Ta alloys, and the alloys reveal a pest phenomenon at 1073 K, and at higher temperatures rapid oxidation occurs. Concerning the oxidation of molybdenum, the addition of aluminum, which has higher activity for oxidation than chromium, is more effective in improving the oxidation resistance of molybdenum than chromium addition, since preferential oxidation of aluminum suppresses the formation of volatile molybdenum oxide.

This original method permitted us a better understanding of these relatively poorly documented catalytic systems. Experiences confirmed that, in a first step, for temperatures inferior to 400degreesC, CrS., species are progressively formed. Then, in a second step for a temperature near 400 degreesC, formation of Cr2S3 entities is achieved, leading to their decomposition into CrS. This showed that the catalytic phase morphology depends drastically on the sulfidation temperature. Moreover, it was found that the increase in DBT activity with the Cr content previously observed was due to a modification of the nature of the active phase and not to an increase in its quantity.

The sulfidation and oxidation behavior of the alloys has been studied as a function of temperature in sulfur vapor pressure of 10(3) Pa and in oxygen of 2 x 10(4) Pa, respectively. The sulfidation of these alloys generally follows a parabolic rate law, being thus diffusion controlled. The sulfidation rates of Al-refractory metal and Cr-refractory metal alloys are several orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional high temperature alloys and comparable to or even lower than those of the corresponding refractory metals. The sulfide scales formed on these alloys consist of two layers, comprising an outer Al2S3 or Cr2S3 layer and an inner refractory metal disulfide layer. The formation of the inner layer is attributed to the excellent sulfidation resistance of these alloys. The oxidation resistance of Al-refractory metal alloys is not sufficiently high, but the addition of silicon improves remarkably their oxidation resistance by synergistic effect of aluminum and silicon. Although the Cr-Mo alloys possess poor oxidation resistance, due to the formation of volatile molybdenum oxide, the oxidation resistance of the Cr-Nb and Cr-Ta alloys is as high as that of typical chromia-forming alloys.

Sulphidation attack is particularly severe in environments of low oxygen (P-O2 similar to 10(-18) Pa) and high sulphur (p(S2) similar to 10(-1)-(10-3) Pa) potentials at temperatures above 700 degrees C. Recognizing that refractory metals have a high resistance to sulphidation in reducing environments, their use as overlay coatings in sulphur-containing environments deserves serious consideration. In the adoption of such an approach, Mo has been recognized as a highly sulphidation-resistant metal with a Kp value of 10(-12) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) in an atmosphere of p(S2) similar to 10(-1) Pa at 750 degrees C.\n\nIn this study, Mo was deposited on two superalloys, Inconel 600 and Nimonic PE11, using air plasma spraying. The coated specimens were tested at 750 degrees C for up to 168 h in an environment comprising p(S2) similar to 10(-1) Pa and p(O2) similar to 10(-18) Pa. The sulphidation kinetics (this is not real through-layer kinetics, since the specimens had open edges) were determined by a discontinuous gravimetric method. The exposed samples were characterized and analysed using SEM, EDX and XRD techniques. For uncoated Inconel 600, a duplex scale was formed which consisted of an outer Ni3S2 layer and an inner Cr2S3 layer. The scale developed on uncoated Nimonic PE11 comprised three sub-scale layers - an outer (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 layer, a mid Cr2S3 layer and an inner MoS2 layer. However, after prolonged exposure, the outer layer contained both (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 and Ni3S2 on the surface of the uncoated Nimonic PE11.\n\nThe kinetics results demonstrated that Mo coating enhanced the corrosion resistance of both alloys, and particularly so for Nimonic PE11. For both substrates, Mo coating led to the development of two sub-scale layers at the early stages of exposure (e.g. up to 5 h). The outer layer consisted of Ni3S2 for Inconel 600 and (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 for Nimonic PE11. A MoS2 layer constituted the inner layer for both materials. After prolonged sulphidation, a Cr2S3 layer gradually developed between the outer layer and the inner MoS, layer.

The effect of preoxidation of these alloys on sulphidation behaviour was also investigated. The initial stages of sulphidation of these alloys were observed and overall sulphidation kinetics was determined. In the presence of yttrium, the sulphidation rate of the alloy decreased by an order of magnitude, and the sulphide layer on the FeCrY alloy was significantly thinner than that formed on the FeCr alloy. Aluminium addition increased sulphidation resistance even more. The FeCrAl and FeCrAlY alloys exhibited parabolic sulphidation kinetics at the two temperatures. On both alloys, initial chromium sulphide (Cr(2)S(3)) formation at grain boundaries and Al(2)S(3) and FeCr(2)S(4) formation over the grains was followed by formation of an outer Cr2S3 layer over a mixed sulphide layer. Preoxidation of the two alloys resulted in an 'incubation period' with practically no sulphidation during subsequent exposure to S bearing environments. After this incubation period, the sulphidation behaviour of the FeCr alloy was similar to that when the alloy was not preoxidised.

The energies of the transversal and longitudinal optic phonon modes were determined from dielectric dispersion relations epsilon \" and -Im(1/epsilon), respectively, via Kramers Kronig analyses. The highest-energy phonon mode exhibits one-mode behaviour whereas the three low-energy phonons reveal two-mode behaviour in contrast to M1-xMx'CoCr2S4 spinel-type solid solutions (with M and M' bivalent metal atoms at the tetrahedral 8a site), which mainly display one-mode behaviour. This different behaviour of CoCr2-xIn2xS4 solid solutions is owing to the change of the metal atom distribution mentioned above in addition to the different masses of the atoms involved. The one-mode behaviour of the highest-energy phonon mode at 389 and 401 cm(-1) (CoCr2S4) and at 323 and 350 cm(-1) (CoIn2S4) is due to the fact that in the eigenvectors of this phonon almost only motions of the nonmetal atoms are involved. The spectra of the solid solutions under investigation, which decompose on annealing at elevated temperatures to chromium and indium rich specimens, reveal further that there is a random distribution of the atoms at the octahedral 16d sites not only in the X-ray but also in the vibration spectroscopic size scale.

Many thermoelectric oxides were investigated for this purpose, but their power factor (PF) values were too small (similar to 10(-4) W m(-1) K-2) to yield a satisfactory figure of merit zT. Changing the anions from O2- to S2- and then to Se2- is a way to increase the covalency. In this review, some examples of sulfides (binary Cr-S or derived from layered TiS2) and an example of selenides, AgCrSe2, have been selected to illustrate the characteristic features of their physical properties. The comparison of the only two semiconducting binary chromium sulfides and of a layered AgCrSe2 selenide shows that the PF values are also in the same order of magnitude as those of transition metal oxides. In contrast, the PF values of the layered sulfides TiS2 and Cu0.1TiS2 are higher, reaching similar to 10(-3) W m(-1) K-2. Apparently the magnetism related to the Cr-S network is detrimental for the PF when compared to the d(0) character of the Ti4+ based sulfides. Finally, the very low PF in AgCrSe2 (PF = 2.25 x 10(-4) W m(1) K-2 at 700 K) is compensated by a very low thermal conductivity (kappa = 0.2 W m(-1) K-1 from the measured C-p) leading to the highest zT value among the reviewed compounds (zT(700 K) = 0.8). The existence of a glassy-like state for the Ag+ cations above 475 K is believed to be responsible for this result.

For the oxides with the fixed valence B-site ions, Al3+ and Zr1+, the change in nonstoichiometry, delta, with P(O2) is small and oxide-ion conduction is predominant with small p-type electronic conduction. In a solid solution of the (SrZrO3)y (La0.75Sr0.25FeO3)1-y system, a continuous conductivity change was observed from semiconductor type to small polaron hopping-type with decrease in y.  La1-xSrxBO3-delta (B=Cr and Fe) shows hopping-type conduction: delta-changes with P(O2) in the range between 0 and a value around x/2. With an increase in delta, [B(B).] decreases and [B(B)'] increases. The conductivity, sigma, is proportional to [B(B).] and [B(B)']. Sigma shows a minimum at the electronic stoichiometry of [B(B).] = [B(B)']. La2-xSrxCoO4, BaBiO3, and La1-xSrxMnO3 (x<0.2) show hopping-type conduction. But the value of sigma is very large at the electronic stoichiometry. The conduction in these oxides was interpreted as electron hopping between the levels which are energetically close to each other. Semi-metallic conduction is observed for La1-xSrxMnO3-delta (x>0.2) and La1-xSrxCoO3-delta. From the measurement of ionic conductivity. chemical diffusion, and isotope diffusion, the oxide vacancy diffusion coefficient. D(V), was obtained.

For the semiconducting end member, BaBiO3, two Bi-O distances, separated by 0.18 angstrom, could be distinguished, consistent with diffraction results.  After alloying with Pb, two Bi-O distances are still observed in the semiconducting alloys (x = 0.75 and 0.50) as well as in the metallic and superconducting phase (x = 0.25).  In all the alloys, the two Bi-O distances and their separations decrease somewhat with increasing Pb concentration.  The weighted average of the Bi-O and Pb-O distances is consistent with half the pseudocubic cell edge (V1/3) determined from diffraction.  The different Bi-O bond lengths are accompanied by charge-density fluctuations which may enhance local, breathing-type phonon modes and thereby increase the coupling between electron and phonon states.

Using the linear-response approach developed in the framework of the linear muffin-tin-orbital method the phonon spectrum of the Ba0.6K0.4BiO3 system is calculated and is compared with the results of the neutron-diffraction measurements. The effect of doping in the calculation is modeled by the virtual crystal and mass approximations. The electron-phonon coupling constant lambda is then evaluated for a grid of phonon wave vector's using the change in the;potential due to phonon distortion found self-consistently. A large coupling of the electrons to the bond-stretching oxygen vibrations and especially to the breathing like vibrations is established. Also, a strongly anharmonic potential well, is found for the tiltinglike motions of the oxygen octahedra. This mode is not coupled to the electrons to linear order in the displacements; therefore an anharmonic contribution to lambda is estimated using the frozen-phonon method. Our total (harmonic plus anharmonic) lambda is found to be 0.34. This is too small to explain high-temperature superconductivity in Ba0.6K0.4BiO3 within the standard;mechanism. Finally, based on standard LDA and LDA + U like calculations, a number of properties of pure BaBiO3 such as-tilting of the octahedra, breathing-distortion, charge disproportionation; and semiconducting energy gap value is evaluated and discussed in connection with the negative-U extended Hubbard model frequently applied to this compound.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "57", "authors": ["Meregalli, V", "Savrasov, SY"], "issue": "22", "pages": "14453-14469"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 13 1997", "title": "Discovery of a second family of bismuth-oxide-based superconductors", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The superconducting oxide BaPb1-xBixO3, discovered in 1975 (ref. 1), is an exotic system having an unusually high transition temperature (T-c) of similar to 12 K, despite a relatively low density of states at the Fermi level. The subsequent prediction(2) that doping the electronically inactive barium donor sites, instead of the bismuth sites, might induce superconductivity with a higher T-c led to the discovery(3,4) in 1988 of superconductivity in the Ba1-xKxBiO3 system (T-c similar to 30 K for x = 0.4). But it remains an open question why many of the superconducting properties of these materials are similar to those of the well-known copper oxide superconductors(5), despite their pronounced structural differences: the former have a three-dimensional bismuth-oxygen framework, whereas the structures of the latter are predominantly two-dimensional, consisting of copper-oxygen planes. Understanding of the copper oxide superconductors has gained immensely from the study of many different superconducting systems, and so it might be expected that the identification of bismuth oxide superconductors beyond the substituted BaBiO3 compounds will prove to be similarly fruitful. Here we report the synthesis of a second family of superconducting bismuth oxides, based on SrBiO3. We show that partial substitution of potassium or rubidium for strontium induces superconductivity with T-c values of similar to 12 K for Sr1-xKxBiO3 (x=0.45-0.6) and similar to 13 K for Sr1-xRbxBiO3 (x = 0.5).", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "390", "authors": ["Kazakov, SM", "Chaillout, C", "Bordet, P", "Capponi, JJ", "NunezRegueiro, M", "Rysak, A", "Tholence, JL", "Radaelli, PG", "Putilin, SN", "Antipov, EV"], "issue": "6656", "pages": "148-150"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0038-1098(85)90414-4", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038109885904144/pdf?md5=0094e9dedfec0c66db7f42893076398c&pid=1-s2.0-0038109885904144-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1985", "title": "THE DETERMINATION OF THE BI VALENCE STATE IN BABIO3 BY NEUTRON POWDER DIFFRACTION DATA", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038109885904144", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0038-1098", "pub": "SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS", "volume": "56", "authors": ["CHAILLOUT, C", "REMEIKA, JP", "SANTORO, A", "MAREZIO, M"], "issue": "10", "pages": "829-831"}, {"DOI": "10.1006/jssc.1996.7200", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002245969697200X/pdf?md5=4bd002537ea88f89e7d30515efeacebe&pid=1-s2.0-S002245969697200X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 1 1997", "title": "Crystal structure of 4H BaRuO3: High pressure phase prepared at ambient pressure", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002245969697200X", "abstract": "Single crystals of BaRuO3 were grown using a BaCl3 flux at ambient pressure, Most of the crystals had the nine-layer rhombohedral structure (9R) which is considered to be the stable form of BaRuO3 at ambient pressure, However, some BaRuO3 crystals in this preparation had the four-layer hexagonal (4H) structure which had been considered as a phase produced only at high pressure (15-30 kbar), The crystal structure of 4H BaRuO3 was refined for the first time, Single crystal X-ray diffraction data gave a space group of P6(3)/mmc (No. 194), a=5.729(1) Angstrom, c=9.500(1) Angstrom, Z=4, a final conventional R(based on F-0) of 2.01% and a wR2 (based on F-0(2)) of 4.07%.

For the parent insulator BaBiO3, the peak-to-peak splitting of the Bi 6s band is found to be large, whereas, the minimum gap is much smaller, qualitatively consistent with the large (approximately 2 eV) optical gap of the direct type and the smaller (approximately 0.5 eV) transport gap of indirect type. Pb substitution for Bi induces new states of Pb 6s character outside the band gap of BaBiO3 and does not induce in-gap spectral weight unlike in cuprate superconductors; the splitting of the Bi 6s band is not significantly reduced by Pb substitution throughout the semiconducting region. Substituted Pb remains tetravalent in the semiconducting phase and does not supply the Bi-O network with extra holes, which explains the stability of the semiconducting phase up to the Pb content of approximately 65%. Nevertheless, the band gap collapses in the metallic region (x <0.35), where a clear Fermi edge is observed. The shifts of the core-level and valence-band peaks with x suggest that a small (approximately 0.3 eV) rigid-band shift of the Fermi level occurs in the metallic region.

The MD simulations are carried out with an effective interaction potential which includes steric effects, Coulomb interactions, and the charge-dipole interactions due to the electronic polarizability of O2-.  The MD results are in good agreement with the INS experiments and electron-tunneling measurements.  Partial DOS of Ba, K, Bi, and O in BaBiO3 and Ba0.6K0.4BiO3 are also determined from MD simulations.

Barium was incorporated with x ranging from 0.0 to 0.82. The temperature variation of the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient) S shows that the critical transition temperature T-c(0) is enhanced (to 93 K) up to x = 0.45 and then disappears for x = 0.82. The results have also suggested an increased interaction of electrons and holes with phonons at low temperatures. The enhancement of T-c(0) is ascribed to the improvement in electric connection between superconducting grains. XRD data show that the high-T-c (2:2:2:3) phase increases and the low-T-c (2:2:1:2) phase decreases as the barium concentration changes from x = 0.0 to 0.45. SEM analysis of a sample (x = 0.45) shows that plate-like grains (2223 phase) are formed. Also, an appropriate level of Ba dopant improves the microhardness and fracture toughness remarkably. The optimum dopant level of Ba from the point of view of mechanical properties is x = 0.45. The improvement of mechanical characteristics is due to the fact that Ba2+ can fill the intergrain spaces, and thereby reinforce the coupling between granules. From the above results, it is inferred that the added Ba has the positive effect of decomposing the structure of the low-T-c phase, leading to the production of BaBiO3 and BaCuO2 and enhancing the high-T-c phase creation.", "ISSN": "0964-1726", "pub": "SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES", "volume": "14", "authors": ["Khalil, SM"], "issue": "4", "pages": "804-810"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0038-1098(91)90216-I", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003810989190216I/pdf?md5=4027a3558a7393505f713e290a8fc7ee&pid=1-s2.0-003810989190216I-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 1991", "title": "ELECTROCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING BA1-XKXBIO3 SINGLE-CRYSTALS", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003810989190216I", "abstract": "We succeeded in the elaboration of Ba(1-x)KxBiO3 single crystals using the electrocrystallization method.

The results obtained using GW (Green's function G and screened Coulomb potential W) based schemes on top of hybrid functionals, including fully self-consistent GW calculations with vertex corrections in the dielectric screening, qualitatively confirm the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof picture but a systematic overestimation of the band gap by about 0.4 eV is observed.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "81", "authors": ["Franchini, C", "Sanna, A", "Marsman, M", "Kresse, G"], "issue": "8", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-4596(91)90353-J", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002245969190353J/pdf?md5=30714fe9776d4643a2c03907c336edaf&pid=1-s2.0-002245969190353J-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 1991", "title": "BABIO2.5, A NEW BISMUTH OXIDE WITH A LAYERED STRUCTURE", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002245969190353J", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-4596", "pub": "JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY", "volume": "92", "authors": ["LIGHTFOOT, P", "HRILJAC, JA", "PEI, S", "ZHENG, Y", "MITCHELL, AW", "RICHARDS, DR", "DABROWSKI, B", "JORGENSEN, JD", "HINKS, DG"], "issue": "2", "pages": "473-479"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0038-1098(96)00698-9", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038109896006989/pdf?md5=5b0995e827ac869f2cd7af37058ab027&pid=1-s2.0-S0038109896006989-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 1997", "title": "Local oxygen octahedra rotations in Ba1-xKxBiO3 and BaBiO3\n", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038109896006989", "abstract": "We report XAFS investigations of BaBiO3 and Ba0.6K0.4BiO3 in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K extending out to fourth nearest neighbours. The results show that in both systems the local structure differs substantially from the average structure determined by neutron diffraction measurements. At temperatures up to at least T = 80 K the local oxygen octahedra rotations in BaBiO3 have in addition to the [1 1 0] component a disordered rotation component about the [0 0 1] axis. To within the experimental accuracy the local rotation components about the [10 0], [0 1 0] and [0 0 1] axes are equal. The results in superconducting Ba0.6K0.4BiO3, are consistent with oxygen octahedra rotations either around [1 1 1] or [1 1 0] type axes. If the rotation is assumed to be about [1 1 1] type axes, the rotation angles are 4.5 degrees up to at least T = 220 K. This local rotation exists in spite of the fact that the crystal is on the average cubic at all temperatures. A theoretical study of the effect of these random rotations on the superconducting properties of Ba1-xKxBiO3 may be of interest.

Disk membranes with z > 1.33, associated with a lower amount of Bi-rich perovskite phase, showed mechanically weak properties while membranes with z <= 1 showed superior stability at temperatures in excess of 800 degrees C. The best performance was obtained for the z = 0.86 disk membrane, reaching oxygen fluxes of 1.2 ml min(-1) cm(-2) at 950 degrees C. This was attributed to the higher sintering temperature and the formation of oxygen deficient phase of BaBiO3-delta perovskite. For gas testing temperatures above 800 degrees C, it was found that the oxygen permeation was limited by both bulk diffusion and surface kinetics as oxygen flux did not increase proportionally to the inverse of membrane thickness reduction. Further analysis showed that the activation energy for oxygen ionic transport changed at 800 degrees C, however the z = 1 sample displayed the opposite trend from other compositions, indicating the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice. Mechanically stable disk membranes exposed to thermal cycling tests resulted in crystal structure instability of the pure perovskite (z = 1) and loss of oxygen vacancies while the z < 1 sample was relatively stable. Conversely, z > 1 sample showed superior thermal cycling and crystal structure stability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results in the present report are rather compatible with the electronic structure proposed by Namatame et al., which involves both holes and electrons, but the indirect gap of the frozen lattice must be wider than they predicted. The holes move easily, while the electrons are in a polaron state and immobile in a static field, but can hop under the action of alternating fields.

For the oxides with the fixed valence B-site ions, Al3+ and Zr1+, the change in nonstoichiometry, delta, with P(O2) is small and oxide-ion conduction is predominant with small p-type electronic conduction. In a solid solution of the (SrZrO3)y (La0.75Sr0.25FeO3)1-y system, a continuous conductivity change was observed from semiconductor type to small polaron hopping-type with decrease in y.  La1-xSrxBO3-delta (B=Cr and Fe) shows hopping-type conduction: delta-changes with P(O2) in the range between 0 and a value around x/2. With an increase in delta, [B(B).] decreases and [B(B)'] increases. The conductivity, sigma, is proportional to [B(B).] and [B(B)']. Sigma shows a minimum at the electronic stoichiometry of [B(B).] = [B(B)']. La2-xSrxCoO4, BaBiO3, and La1-xSrxMnO3 (x<0.2) show hopping-type conduction.

But it remains an open question why many of the superconducting properties of these materials are similar to those of the well-known copper oxide superconductors(5), despite their pronounced structural differences: the former have a three-dimensional bismuth-oxygen framework, whereas the structures of the latter are predominantly two-dimensional, consisting of copper-oxygen planes. Understanding of the copper oxide superconductors has gained immensely from the study of many different superconducting systems, and so it might be expected that the identification of bismuth oxide superconductors beyond the substituted BaBiO3 compounds will prove to be similarly fruitful.

Pb substitution for Bi induces new states of Pb 6s character outside the band gap of BaBiO3 and does not induce in-gap spectral weight unlike in cuprate superconductors; the splitting of the Bi 6s band is not significantly reduced by Pb substitution throughout the semiconducting region. Substituted Pb remains tetravalent in the semiconducting phase and does not supply the Bi-O network with extra holes, which explains the stability of the semiconducting phase up to the Pb content of approximately 65%. Nevertheless, the band gap collapses in the metallic region (x <0.35), where a clear Fermi edge is observed. The shifts of the core-level and valence-band peaks with x suggest that a small (approximately 0.3 eV) rigid-band shift of the Fermi level occurs in the metallic region.

Barium was incorporated with x ranging from 0.0 to 0.82.

The results have also suggested an increased interaction of electrons and holes with phonons at low temperatures. The enhancement of T-c(0) is ascribed to the improvement in electric connection between superconducting grains. XRD data show that the high-T-c (2:2:2:3) phase increases and the low-T-c (2:2:1:2) phase decreases as the barium concentration changes from x = 0.0 to 0.45. SEM analysis of a sample (x = 0.45) shows that plate-like grains (2223 phase) are formed. Also, an appropriate level of Ba dopant improves the microhardness and fracture toughness remarkably. The optimum dopant level of Ba from the point of view of mechanical properties is x = 0.45. The improvement of mechanical characteristics is due to the fact that Ba2+ can fill the intergrain spaces, and thereby reinforce the coupling between granules.

At temperatures up to at least T = 80 K the local oxygen octahedra rotations in BaBiO3 have in addition to the [1 1 0] component a disordered rotation component about the [0 0 1] axis. To within the experimental accuracy the local rotation components about the [10 0], [0 1 0] and [0 0 1] axes are equal.

Disk membranes with z > 1.33, associated with a lower amount of Bi-rich perovskite phase, showed mechanically weak properties while membranes with z <= 1 showed superior stability at temperatures in excess of 800 degrees C. The best performance was obtained for the z = 0.86 disk membrane, reaching oxygen fluxes of 1.2 ml min(-1) cm(-2) at 950 degrees C. This was attributed to the higher sintering temperature and the formation of oxygen deficient phase of BaBiO3-delta perovskite. For gas testing temperatures above 800 degrees C, it was found that the oxygen permeation was limited by both bulk diffusion and surface kinetics as oxygen flux did not increase proportionally to the inverse of membrane thickness reduction. Further analysis showed that the activation energy for oxygen ionic transport changed at 800 degrees C, however the z = 1 sample displayed the opposite trend from other compositions, indicating the formation of more oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice. Mechanically stable disk membranes exposed to thermal cycling tests resulted in crystal structure instability of the pure perovskite (z = 1) and loss of oxygen vacancies while the z < 1 sample was relatively stable. Conversely, z > 1 sample showed superior thermal cycling and crystal structure stability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

When holes are added to BaBiO3 by doping, it remains insulating until a very large hole concentration is reached, at which point it becomes superconducting. The mechanism for insulating behavior of more lightly doped samples is formation of small polarons or bipolarons. These are self-organized point defects in the Peierls order parameter, which trap carriers in bound states inside the Peierls gap. We calculate properties of the polarons and bipolarons using the Rice-Sneddon model.

Although the host material BaBiO3 has a monoclinic structure, the system changes from a monoclinic to an orthorhombic structure with a small doping of potassium (0 less than or equal to x 0.35) and behaves similar to a doped semiconductor, without exhibiting superconductivity. In the composition range, holes are majority carriers in the transport phenomena. When x exceeds a critical value (similar to 0.35), the system goes into a cubic superconducting phase with a single metallic band. The vicinity of the critical composition transport phenomena is easy to understand assuming the existence of two conducting channels that are made up of metallic and semiconducting phases. Maximum T-c exceeding 30 K was observed at x similar to 0.4, where carrier density was at its maximum. Overdoping with potassium suppresses superconductivity. In the metallic composition of x > 0.45, transport seems to correlate with the phonon mode with an energy distribution of 15-43 meV. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The first one is the standard method, based on the comparison of total-energy curvatures. The second method, proposed in the present work, relies on the analysis of single particle energies and yields much smaller numerical errors. For BaBiO3 interaction parameters are obtained for the following models: (i) s and p orbitals at Bi and p orbitals at O sites. Here, U-s = 3.1 +/- 0.4 eV, U-sp = 1.4 +/- 0.2 eV, U-p = 2.2 +/- 0.4 eV are found, (ii) s(Bi) and p(O) orbitals, yielding U-s = 1.9 +/- 0.7 eV, and (iii) an effective one-band model, leading to U-s = 0.6 +/- 0.4 eV. Further studies have been performed for breathing distorted BaBiO3 and for various Ba1-xKxBi1-yPbyO3 alloys using virtual crystal approximations.

Even through careful comparison of the full-width at half-maximum values, we found no evidence for Ba2LaIrO6 adopting either monoclinic (I2/m) or mixed rhombohedral (R (3) over bar) and monoclinic (I2/m) structures at room temperature, becoming triclinic (I (1) over bar) at below about 200 K. The correct space group is just R (3) over bar at temperatures between 82 and 653 K. Furthermore, the R (3) over bar -> Fm (3) over barm phase transition does occur in Ba2LaIrO6, but the transition temperature is found to be much higher than the reported value. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Ba2LaSbO6 was synthesized for the first time by conventional solid state reaction process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and Rietveld analysis revealed that, contrary to the other Ba2RESbO6 (RE=Rare-Earth other than La) complex perovskites, which are cubic, Ba2LaSbO6 crystallizes in a monoclinic system having space group P2(1)/n. Dielectric properties of Ba2LaSbO6 at frequencies up to 40 GHz and in temperatures ranging from 50 to 350 K were determined by analyzing the resonant modes in cavities totally filled with the measured material. The dielectric constant (epsilon')=15.8+/-0.2% and at 77 K loss factor (tgdelta)approximate to9x10(-4). Preliminary studies reveal that at the processing temperatures, Ba2LaSbO6 do not react with YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) and Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox [Bi (2212)] superconductors.

Dielectric relaxation peaks are observed in the imaginary part of complex permittivity of the spectra. The frequency dependence of real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity is analyzed using Cole-Cole model. The temperature dependent relaxation time is found to obey the Arrhenius law having activation energy 0.48 eV which indicates that the conduction mechanism in the materials may be due to polaron hopping based on electron carriers.

Pr L-III XANES measurements show that at room temperature the Pr is trivalent in the Ru-rich compounds with x < 0.25. At higher Ir contents the Pr is tetravalent. High-resolution powder synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction methods have been used to study the composition and temperature dependence of the crystal structures of these oxides. The Ru and Ir are statistically distributed on one of the two available B-sites. The oxides undergo an apparently first-order monoclinic P2(1)/n to tetragonal P4/mnc phase transition in response to the change on the Pr and Ru/Ir valence. High temperatures and Ru contents favor the lower symmetry monoclinic structure, that is arises from the presence of the larger Pr-III cations. The variations in the observed metal-oxygen bond distances are consistent with a simultaneous change in the valence of the Ru/Ir accompanying the Pr-III-Pr-IV valence transition.

The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern shows the monoclinic I-2/m symmetry of the system. The X-ray photo-emission spectroscopy (XPS) is used to obtain the oxidation states of the constituent ions of BLT. The band gap energy of BLT obtained from UV-visible spectrum is found to be 2.03 eV. Raman spectroscopy is applied to analyze the crystal structure and the vibrational modes of BLT. The density functional theory calculations implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package with generalized gradient approximation are performed to obtain the density of states (DOS) and the eigen vectors and the eigen frequencies of vibrational modes. The calculated vibrational modes are compared with the experimental Raman modes. The calculated DOS spectrum is compared with the valence band XPS spectrum. The dielectric relaxation of the sample is investigated in the frequency range from 50 Hz to 1 MHz and in the temperature range from 30 degrees C to 300 degrees C using alternating current impedance spectroscopy. The relaxation mechanism is explained by fitting the experimental dielectric data with the Cole-Cole model. The frequency dependent ac conductivity spectra are found to follow the power law.

In both series extensive phase segregation is observed demonstrating limited solubility of Sb5+ in these Nb5+ perovskites, irrespective of the precise structures of the double perovskite. Evidence for a monoclinic I2/m phase in the series formed between tetragonal I4/m Ba2EuNbO6 and rhombohedral R (3) over bar Ba2EuNbO6 is presented.

In the case of M = Ca, the space groups are either monoclinic P2(1)/n (M' = U) or cubic Fm (3) over barm (M' = W and Te). The tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetry reported earlier for Ba2SrTeO6 and Ba2CaUO6, respectively, were not observed. In addition, non-ambient X-ray diffraction data were collected and analyzed for Ba2SrWO6 and Ba2CaWO6 in the temperature range between 80 and 723 K. It was found that the rhombohedral R (3) over bar structure exists in Ba2SrWO6 above room temperature between the monoclinic and the cubic structure, whereas the cubic Ba2CaWO6 undergoes a structural phase transition at low temperature to the tetragonal I4/m Structure.
