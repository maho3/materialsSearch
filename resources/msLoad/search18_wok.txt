Compounds in class 1 are based on the hexagonal Li3N structure, unique to nit-ides. Compounds in group 2, by contrast, crystallise with oxide structures (alpha -NaFeO2 or KCoO2). Specific and unusual synthetic methods have been developed to reproducibly prepare these compounds. Compounds in series 1 contain ordered or disordered Li vacancies at increased levels relative to the parent Li3N, itself a Li+ fast ion conductor. Nitrides in series 2 should be nominally diamagnetic (S=0), yet magnetic measurements reveal behaviour seemingly inconsistent with this assumption. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Large in-plane electronic transport and small electronic transport perpendicular to the layers along the c-axis arose from reduced electronic dispersion along the c-axis compared with other in-plane directions.

We find that the majority of compounds are more stable with the KCoO2 structure-type where M is coordinated to five nitrogen atoms in a distorted square-based pyramidal geometry.

Room temperature TEM studies show that several classes of superstructures exist in the stoichiometric single crystals of this phase; on cooling the TEM diffraction patterns change and become more complex. Temperature-dependent lattice constants of polycrystalline BaCoS2-delta show anomalies near -60 degrees C. BaCoS2-delta is a metastable compound that is prepared above 850 degrees C and subsequently quenched. Synthetic studies show that (1) at the preparation temperature BaCoS2 is in equilibrium with S vapor at pressures on the order of an atmosphere, producing a nonstoichiometric phase BaCoS2-delta; (2) adding some excess sulfur can reduce delta to zero; and (3) too much excess sulfur results in partial or complete melting of the system (however, stoichiometric BaCoS2 crystals can be obtained from those melts).

We estimate the electronic structure parameters of the system and deduce that the hopping interaction strength t(pd) decreases in the solid solution with a decrease of the Ni content, while U-dd and Delta do not change appreciably. Thus, the metal-to-insulator transition in this system is found to be driven primarily by covalency effects, though the static disorder in the system is expected to play an important role in determining the details of physical properties.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "63", "authors": ["Krishnakumar, SR", "Saha-Dasgupta, T", "Shanthi, N", "Mahadevan, P", "Sarma, DD"], "issue": "4", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.59.8745", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 1 1999", "title": "Electronic transport and antiferromagnetism in the layered compound BaCoS2\n", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.59.8745", "abstract": "\nBaCoS2 is a Mott insulator with a Neel temperature (7(N)) close to room temperature.

The crystal structure of these new intermetallic superconductors, typified by LuNi2B2C (ref. 7), consists of one square layer of rock-salt-type LnC (where Ln stands for a rare-earth element) alternating with one layer of transition-metal boride tetrahedra. Here we report superconductivity at 12-13 K in a new quaternary intermetallic system, lanthanum nickel boro-nitride. We have determined the formula and crystal structure of superconducting La3Ni2B2N3, and also of a related non-superconducting phase LaNiBN. The crystal structure of La3Ni2B2N3 is related to that of LuNi2B2C, but consists of three rock-salt-type LaN layers alternating with tetrahedral Ni2B2 layers, an arrangement considerably more two-dimensional than is found for the superconducting boro-carbides. These discoveries strongly suggest that a large number of unusual superconducting intermetallic phases are get to be found, based on materials more complex than have previously been considered as candidates for superconductivity.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "372", "authors": ["CAVA, RJ", "ZANDBERGEN, HW", "BATLOGG, B", "EISAKI, H", "TAKAGI, H", "KRAJEWSKI, JJ", "PECK, WF", "GYORGY, EM", "UCHIDA, S"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v372/n6503/abs/372245a0.html", "issue": "6503", "pages": "245-247"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/372759a0", "pdflink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v372/n6508/pdf/372759a0.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 22 1994", "title": "STRUCTURE OF THE 13-K SUPERCONDUCTOR LA3NI2B2N3 AND THE RELATED PHASE LANIBN\n", "abstract": "THE recent discovery of superconductivity in a number of alloys containing boron and carbon has revived interest in the field of intermetallic superconductors(1-3). Although two structural forms have now been identified(4-6), most of the new intermetallic superconductors have a crystal structure typified by that of the quaternary alloy LuNi2B2C, in which layers of rock-salt-structured LuC alternate with nickel boride tetrahedra(4,5). The range of superconducting intermetallic compounds was extended recently by the discovery of superconductivity in a system of quaternary boro-nitride alloys, La-Ni-B-N (ref. 7). Here we report the structure of the superconducting phase in this system, La3Ni2B2N3, together with that of the related non-superconducting phase, LaNiBN. We find that these two phases are members of a homologous series (LaN)(n)(Ni2B2), with n = 3 and n = 2, respectively. Furthermore, our samples contain planar defects that suggest the existence of phases with larger n. Varying the number, n, of LaN layers within this system might thus provide a way to investigate the effect of dimensionality on the superconducting properties of intermetallics.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "372", "authors": ["ZANDBERGEN, HW", "JANSEN, J", "CAVA, RJ", "KRAJEWSKI, JJ", "PECK, WF"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v372/n6508/abs/372759a0.html", "issue": "6508", "pages": "759-761"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja211293x", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 8 2012", "title": "Superconductivity in LaTMBN and La3TM2B2N3 (T-M = Transition Metal) Synthesized under High Pressure", "abstract": "Various layered boronitrides (LaN)(n)(TM2B2) (T-M = transition metal; n = 2, 3) have been prepared using a high-pressure synthesis technique in which an inverse alpha-PbO-type TM2B2 layer is separated by two or three rock salt-type LaN layers and these layers are connected through linear (BN) units.

Such materials exhibit layered structures of the general type (LnX)(n)(Ni2B2) (Ln = lanthanide, particularly the nonmagnetic La-III or Lu-III; X = C or N; n = 1, 2, or 3) containing planar square Ni nets bonded to BCB2- ligands in the superconducting LnNi(2)B(2)C, BC3- ligands in the nonsuperconducting LnNiBC and Ln(2)NiBC(2), and BN2- ligands in the superconducting La3Ni2B2N3. The linear BCB2- bridges linking adjacent Ni layers in LnNi(2)B(2)C lead to a porous conducting skeleton in LnNi(2)B(2)C. The BC3- ligands in the nonsuperconducting LuNiBC and the closely related Ln(2)NiBC(2) = Ln(2)C(2) . 2LnNiBC do not link adjacent Ni layers in LuNiBC so that LuNiBC has only a two-dimensional conducting skeleton, which is not necessarily porous in these two dimensions. The superconducting La3Ni2B2N3 = LaN . 2LaNiBN has a similar local Ni environment as LuNiBC but with BN2- rather than the isoelectronic BC3- ligands above and below each Ni layer. However, in La3Ni2B2N3 unlike LuNiBC the LaNiBN units are linked electronically by the La atoms in the intermediate LaN layer leading to a three-dimensional conducting skeleton in La3Ni2B2N3 rather than the two-dimensional conducting skeleton of LuNiBC. The linear BNLaNB units linking the Ni layers in La3Ni2B2N3 lead to a porous conducting skeleton similar to that in the LnNi(2)B(2)C superconductors.

We have found that their electronic structures are substantially three-dimensional, leading to metallicity both in NiB (PtB) and the intervening LaN layers. Our ab initio phonon calculations show that almost all phonon modes contribute to the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) mechanism, reflecting that both layers are involved in the superconductivity. For LaNiBN, we obtain an EPC strength of lambda = 0.52 and a logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency of omega(log) = 376 K, leading to T-c = 3.9 K. Compared with the Ni B-1g mode in LaNiBN, the Pt B-1g mode in LaPtBN is reduced by similar to 70%, leading to a slightly enhanced lambda = 0.56 and an similar to 20% reduced omega(log). The estimated T-c is 5.4 K for LaPtBN, in good agreement with the experiment. We do not find any indication of magnetic instability for either LaNiBN or LaPtBN, which implies that both systems are EPC mediated superconductors. Further, we have found an interesting trend of monotonic increase of T-c with respect to the boron height in the NiB (PtB) layer of both borocarbide and boronitride superconductors, which suggests a possible way to enhance T-c in these systems.
