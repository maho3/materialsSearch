Although superconductivity exists in alloy that contains the element Fe, LaOMPn (with M = Fe, Ni; and Pn = P and AS) is the first system where Fe plays the key role to the occurrence of superconductivity. LaOMPn has a layered crystal structure with an Fe-based plane. It is quite natural to search whether there exists other Fe based planar compounds that exhibit superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity with zero-resistance transition temperature at 8 K in the PbO-type alpha-FeSe compound. A key observation is that the clean superconducting phase exists only in those samples prepared with intentional Se deficiency. FeSe, compared with LaOFeAs, is less toxic and much easier to handle. What is truly striking is that this compound has the same, perhaps simpler, planar crystal sublattice as the layered oxypnictides. Therefore, this result provides an opportunity to better understand the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in this class of unconventional superconductors.", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "pub": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "volume": "105", "authors": ["Hsu, FC", "Luo, JY", "Yeh, KW", "Chen, TK", "Huang, TW", "Wu, PM", "Lee, YC", "Huang, YL", "Chu, YY", "Yan, DC", "Wu, MK"], "issue": "38", "pages": "14262-14264"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0927-7757(94)03028-X", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092777579403028X/pdf?md5=de37ca4ea3b904fff70aae3e116936d3&pid=1-s2.0-092777579403028X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 10 1995", "title": "POLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE)-POLY(PROPYLENE OXIDE)-POLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE) BLOCK-COPOLYMER SURFACTANTS IN AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS AND AT INTERFACES - THERMODYNAMICS, STRUCTURE, DYNAMICS, AND MODELING", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092777579403028X", "abstract": "The association properties of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) copolymers (commercially available as Poloxamers and Pluronics) in aqueous solutions, and the adsorption of these copolymers at interfaces are reviewed. At low temperatures and/or concentrations the PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers exist in solution as individual coils (unimers). Thermodynamically stable micelles are formed with increasing copolymer concentration and/or solution temperature, as revealed by surface tension, light scattering, and dye solubilization experiments. The unimer-to-micelle transition is not sharp, but spans a concentration decade or 10 K. The critical micellization concentration (CMC) and temperature (CMT) decrease with an increase in the copolymer PPO content or molecular weight. The dependence of CMC on temperature, together with differential scanning calorimetry experiments, indicates that the micellization process of PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers in water is endothermic and driven by a decrease in the polarity of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) segments as the temperature increases, and by the entropy gain in water when unimers aggregate to form micelles (hydrophobic effect). The free energy and enthalpy of micellization can be correlated to the total number of EO and PO segments in the copolymer and its molecular weight. The micelles have hydrodynamic radii of approximately 10 nm and aggregation numbers in the order of 50. The aggregation number is thought to be independent of the copolymer concentration and to increase with temperature. Phenomenological and mean-field lattice models for the formation of micelles can describe qualitatively the trends observed experimentally. In addition, the lattice models can provide information on the distribution of the EO and PO segments in the micelle. The PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers adsorb on both air-water and solid-water interfaces; the PPO block is located at the interface while the PEO block extends into the solution, when copolymers are adsorbed at hydrophobic interfaces. Gels are formed by certain PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymers at high concentrations, with the micelles remaining apparently intact in the form of a ''crystal''. The gelation onset temperature and the thermal stability range of the gel increase with increasing PEO block length. A comparison of PEO-PPO copolymers with PEO-PBO and PEO-PS block copolymers and C(i)E(j) surfactants is made, and selected applications of PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer solutions (such as solubilization of organics, protection of microorganisms, and biomedical uses of micelles and gels) are presented.", "ISSN": "0927-7757", "pub": "COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS", "volume": "96", "authors": ["ALEXANDRIDIS, P", "HATTON, TA"], "issue": "1-2", "pages": "1-46"}, {"DOI": "10.1002/adfm.200390013", "pdflink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1616-3028/homepage/2126_media.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 2003", "title": "Novel nanostructures of functional oxides synthesized by thermal evaporation", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.200390013/abstract;jsessionid=3D4D237C47AE6537AFF76A5CEEBAE6FB.f02t02", "abstract": "Functional oxides are the fundamentals of smart devices.

As a result, helical nanostructures and nanorings are formed by rolling up single-crystal nanobelts; this phenomenon is a consequence of minimizing the total energy contributed by spontaneous polarization and elasticity.

A simple model is developed to show how the PBO relates to identified forms of matrix and functional organisation and a case study is used to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of the two organisational forms for CoPS production. On the positive side, the PBO is an intrinsically innovative form as it creates and recreates new organisational structures around the demands of each CoPS project and each major customer. The PBO is able to cope with emerging properties in production and respond flexibly to changing client needs. It is also effective at integrating different types of knowledge and skill and coping with the project risks and uncertainties common in CoPS projects. However, the PBO is inherently weak where the matrix organisation is strong: in performing routine tasks, achieving economies of scale, coordinating cross-project resources, facilitating company wide technical development, and promoting organisation-wide learning. The PBO can also work against the wider interests of corporate strategy and business coordination. Strategies to stimulate organisational learning and technical leadership include the deployment of coordinators along functional lines to cut across project interests and incentives. Project tracking and guidance at the corporate level is also important for achieving broader business goals. The paper illustrates the wide variety of organisational choices involved in producing CoPS and argues that the nature, composition, and scale of the product in question have an important bearing on appropriate organisational form.

Linear sweep voltammograms at a Pt anode at several concentrations, sweep rates, and pH were interpreted in terms of deposition of oligomers on the anode surface. Chronopotentiometry at Pt showed that the oxidation potentials of the chlorinated phenol congeners ranged from +0.6 to +1.3 V vs SHE in the pH range 2-12; four electrons are transferred for mono- and trichlorophenols and two for pentachlorophenol. Passivation increased in parallel with the uncompensated resistance of the solution and occurred only at potentials at which water is oxidized, suggesting that the formation of the oligomer film involves attack of hydroxyl radicals on electrochemically oxidized substrate. Seven chlorinated phenols were electrolyzed at PbO2, SnO2, and IrO2 anodes.

Methane data from the UARS Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer and water vapor from the Microwave Limb Sounder are also used to fill in winter polar latitudes (where HALOE measurements are unavailable), yielding complete global seasonal cycles. These data reveal well-known seasonal variations with novel detail, including 1) the presence of enhanced latitudinal gradients (mixing barriers) in the subtropics and across the polar vortices, 2) strong descent inside the polar vortices during winter and spring, and 3) vigorous seasonality in the tropical upper stratosphere, related to seasonal upwelling and the semiannual oscillation. The observed variations are in agreement with aspects of the mean meridional circulation derived from stratospheric meteorological analyses. Interannual variations are also investigated, and a majority of the variance is found to be coherent with the equatorial quasibiennial oscillation (QBO).

The often subtle response of the proxy records to this oscillation, in combination with its short duration, make it difficult to detect. Owing to its chronostratigraphic position between the 10000-9900 and 9600-9500 C-14 plateaux (c. 11300-11150 calendar yr BP) it is also difficult to C-14 date with precision. We find that the vegetation response to the PBO varies between sites and regions. In contrast to the pioneer vegetation in Iceland and southern Sweden, the expanding birch-pine forest in Germany-Denmark was more susceptible to deteriorating growing conditions. The combined lacustrine, tree-ring and glacial records imply that the PBO was characterised by cool and humid conditions throughout northwestern and central Europe. This is documented by vegetation changes, decreased aquatic production, increased soil erosion, increased H-2 and C-13 content in tree-rings, readvances or stillstands of the;ice sheet in Norway and Finland, and ingression of brackish water into the Baltic. Icelandic proxy records from lake sediments and glacial moraines imply cooler conditions than during the previous Preboreal period, but not as extreme as during the Younger Dryas. Greenland records suggest that the early Preboreal was characterised by ice readvances, as an effect of cool climate and increased precipitation (in relation to the Younger Dryas). It was not until the end of the PBO that climate was warm enough to melt the land-based ice sheet. This Preboreal oscillation, found on both sides of the Nordic Seas, is interpreted as an effect of increased freshwater forcing on the thermohaline circulation in the Nordic Seas, which is implied by a simultaneous and distinct rise in the atmospheric C-14/C-12 ratio. A slow-down of the thermohaline circulation may temporarily have pushed the Polar Front further south.

However, the timing of the collision is controversial and post-collisional exhumation has not been precisely dated. This study applies the electron microprobe Th-U-Pb monazite dating technique to determine the ages of the peak metamorphic event and subsequent exhumation of the low- to medium-grade Luliang and Wutai Complexes in the Trans-North China Orogen. Electron microprobe Th-U-Pb monazite data for the Luliang Complex reveal five ThO2*/PbO age ranges: (1) 1940-1938 Ma, (2) 1880-1847 Ma, (3) 1795-1755 Ma, (4) 1720-1703 Ma, and (5) similar to 1648 Ma. Of these age ranges, the first four have also been recorded in the Wutai Complex, which yields ThO2*/PbO ages of (1) similar to 1930Ma, (2) 1838-1822Ma, (3) similar to 1793 Ma, and (4) similar to 1719 Ma. The oldest age range of 1940-1930 Ma is interpreted to record the widespread emplacement of mafic dikes in rocks of the Luliang and Wutai Complexes. The age range of 1882-1822 Ma is in accord with the SHRIMP U-Pb ages of metamorphic zircons and mineral Sm-Nd and Ar-40/Ar-39 ages obtained for other complexes in the orogen, and is interpreted as the age of the major metamorphic event caused by amalgamation between the Eastern and the Western Blocks. The age range of 1795-1755 Ma is consistent with emplacement of large scale unmetamorphosed mafic swarms at 1800-1765 Ma, interpreted as the time of post-orogenic extension. The 1720-1703 Ma and similar to 1648 Ma ages are considered to date later multiple stages of hydrothermal alteration, since monazites with such young ages only occur along fractures in older monazite grains and at the rims. These new monazite ThO2*/PbO ages support the tectonic model for the evolution of the North China Craton that envisages discrete Eastern and Western Blocks colliding along the Trans-North China Orogen at similar to 1.85 Ga and then undergoing post-collisional extension in the period 1795-1755 Ma.

Study of the influence of temperature shows that the rate consumption of phenol initially at 21 mmol dm(-3) is mass transport limited. CO2 is immediately formed following the 1,4-BQ-maleic acid pathway involving 20 faradays and forming 4 mol of CO2 and/or the 1,4-BQ-intermediary in C2 pathway at 16 faradays with formation of 2 mol of CO2. The faradaic yield values show that a phenol molecule adsorbed on a catalytic site undergoes a succession of oxidation steps involving, on average, five electrons without desorption of the intermediate products. This number of electrons varies according to the operating conditions (temperature, anodic current density, initial phenol concentration, hydrodynamic conditions, etc.).

The present results demonstrate that conjugated polymer exciplexes represent a new approach to blue luminescence as well as a means to enhance the solid state fluorescence quantum efficiency of conjugated polymers.", "ISSN": "0024-9297", "pub": "MACROMOLECULES", "volume": "27", "authors": ["OSAHENI, JA", "JENEKHE, SA"], "issue": "3", "pages": "739-742"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.71.184302", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 2005", "title": "Finite-size and pressure effects on the Raman spectrum nanocrystalline anatse TiO(2)", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.184302", "abstract": "The Raman scattering behavior of anatase nanocrystals with average diameters of 4, 8, 20, and 34 nm has been compared with bulk crystal data in order to establish size-dependent changes to the phonon spectrum at ambient conditions. Further, the high-pressure behavior of the anatase nanocrystals was examined at room-temperature using in situ Raman scattering data obtained in diamond-anvil cells to a maximum pressure of 41 GPa. The size-dependent changes to the Raman spectrum are best explained in terms of three-dimensional confinement of phonons in finite-sized nanocrystalline anatase. The difference in slopes obtained for the pressure shifts of Raman modes between nanocrystalline and single crystal anatase is in conformity with the observed size-dependent bulk modulus values. The metastability of anatase as a function of pressure is demonstrated to be size dependent, with smaller crystallites preserving the structure to higher pressures. Three size regimes have been recognized for the pressure-induced phase transition of anatase at room temperature: an anatase-amorphous transition regime,at the smallest crystallite sizes, an anatase-baddeleyite transition regime at intermediate crystallite sizes, and an anatase-alpha-PbO(2) transition regime comprising large nanocrystals to macroscopic single crystals. This size-dependent phase selectivity of anatase at high pressures explains the recent contradictory experimental data. A semiquantitative phase diagram for anatase metastability as a function of size and pressure at room temperature is proposed.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "71", "authors": ["Swamy, V", "Kuznetsov, A", "Dubrovinsky, LS", "Caruso, RA", "Shchukin, DG", "Muddle, BC"], "issue": "18", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/b401472n", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "JUN 7 2004", "title": "Relativistic quantum chemistry: the multiconfigurational approach", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2004/CP/b401472n", "abstract": "A multiconfigurational approach to the quantum chemistry of heavy element compounds is described.

The present study extends this work by examining the interactions of selected Pb minerals and a Pb-contaminated soil with apatite. Specimen-grade PbO and PbCO3 were reacted separately with hydroxylapatite (HA) in controlled pH reactors. Hydroxypyromorphite (HP) formed at the expense of HA, PbO, and PbCO3 after a reaction period of 2 days, causing significant decreases in aqueous Pb concentrations. The extent of reaction was pH dependent, with more HP formation at pH 5 than at pH 6 or pH 7. Equilibrium modeling with MINEQL(+) indicated the stoichiometric conversion of the native Pb solids to HP at all pH values examined in laboratory experiments. In companion experiments, particle size and density separation techniques were used to obtain Pb-enriched fractions from a contaminated soil. These were identified as PbO and PbCO3 with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Pb-enriched fractions were reacted with HA, and the formation of HP (at the expense of ''native'' Pb solids) was observed by XRD and SEM.

The anode life after modification was greatly improved to be more than 10 yr in common electrochemical current conditions. Such an anode was effective for partial degradation of phenolic compounds, but selective because reactive activities were varied with different substituents. Characterized by SEM and XRD, the crystal form of the anode was verified to be mainly beta-PbO2, and it hardly changed when used for p-nitrophenol degradation for around 320 h although there existed slow electrode corrosion. The active species generated during anodic oxidation were determined to be mainly hydroxyl radical and little ozone.

QTP was rapidly dosed up to a maximum of 800 mg to 0.7-1.0 mEq/L; or DVP to 50-100 mug/mL.\n\nResults: Fifty-six of 91 (61.5%) individuals in the QTP + Li/DVP group compared with 49 of 100 (49%) taking PBO + Li/DVP completed the study. A significantly greater mean reduction in total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score was observed at end-point in patients receiving QTP + Li/DVP compared with those in the PBO + Li/DVP group (-13.76 versus -9.93; p = 0.021).

The polarized Raman spectra were deconvoluted into seven bands which have been classified into four sets of modes: (1) depolarized low-frequency Raman modes at 30-70 cm(-1), (2) strongly polarized Pb and Bi heavy metal vibrations at 120 to 140 cm(-1); (3) polarized Ga-O-Pb, Ga-O-Bi, Bi-O-Pb, Ga-O-Ga and Bi-O-Bi bridging-oxygen modes at 300-600 cm(-1); (4) non-bridging oxygen modes at 600-700 cm(-1). The optic vibrations observed in the series of glasses indicate that most cations behave essentially as network-formers. The low-frequency Raman scattering was analyzed on the basis of Martin and Brenig's acoustic model, from which some intermediate range structural information is derived. The structural correlation and structural units which determine the high frequency modes in these glasses are discussed.", "ISSN": "0022-3093", "pub": "JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS", "volume": "202", "authors": ["Kharlamov, AA", "Almeida, RM", "Heo, J"], "issue": "3", "pages": "233-240"}]]], [{"magnet": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], "ferromagnetism": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "band structure": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "x-ray": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "antiferromagnetism": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "DFT": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "doped": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "metal": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "mu-SR": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "resist": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "ferrimagnetism": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "nuclear magnetic resonance": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "DMFT": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "neutron": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "insulator": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "conduct": [9, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "NMR": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "\\d K": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "charge density wave": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "susceptibility": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "superconduct": [9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}], "#62846; #62847; #62848; #62849; #99776; #290409; #290411; #161788; #163555; #163556; #163557; #163558; #166439; #166440; #166441; #169283; #169285; #169287; #169289; #169291; #169293; #169295; #169297; #169299; #169301; #169303; #169306; #169309; #169311; #169313; #169315; #185465; #977900", "superconduct; conduct; resist; metal; insulator; doped; ferromagnetism; antiferromagnetism; ferrimagnetism; magnet; \\\\d K; DFT; DMFT; charge density wave; band structure; susceptibility; NMR; nuclear magnetic resonance; neutron; mu-SR; x-ray; "]
