Dynamic properties of charge carriers, including trapping, recombination, and transfer, in a number of semiconductor nanoparticle systems have been studied using powerful time-resolved laser techniques. Several interesting features have been identified, including exciton-exciton annihilation upon trap state saturation at high excitation intensities for CdS, CdSe, TiO2, ultrafast electron injection in dye sensitization of TiO2, increased transient absorption over transient bleach with increasing intensity for Ag2S and CuxS due to trap state saturation, surface dependence of electronic relaxation in PbI2 and BiI3, complex kinetics of the orange emission in Mn-doped ZnS, and surface-independent relaxation for Fe2O3 and PbS.

The 12-crown-4 complexes are seven-coordinate while all of the remaining complexes are 8-coordinate including two pentadentate EO5 complexes. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) ligands closely mimic the conformations of analogous crown ethers. When 18-crown-6 is used in these reactions, two completely different 8-coordinate complexes are isolated: the tridentate [BiCl3(MeOH)(18-crown-6)] and the ionic [BiBr2(18-crown-6)][BiBr4]. Reaction of BiBr3 with hexaethylene glycol (EO6) produces an 8-coordinate complex with a hexadentate EO6 ligand analogous to that obtained with 18-crown-6, [BiBr2(EO6)][BiBr4]. The use of BiI3 results in the formation of polymeric anions which hinder solubility and the isolation of pure complexes. The only completely characterized product was formed by reaction with EO5, [BiI2(EO5)][Bi2I7].2MeOH. (The glycol mimics 18-crown-6.) Structural analysis of the products appears to support the idea of a stereochemically active lone pair with several directed secondary interactions around the lone pair site. The strong influence of the pyramidal BiX3 unit and very long Bi-O contacts around locations where an active lone pair would be assumed to reside are taken as evidence of lone pair activity. The structurally characterized complexes include [BiBr3(12-crown-4)] (an incomplete characterization), [BiX3(15-crown-5)] (X = Cl, Br), [BiX3(benzo-15-crown-5)] (X = Cl, Br), [BiCl3(MeOH)(18-crown-6)], [BiBr2(18-crown-6)][BiBr4], [BiX3(EO4)] (X = Cl, Br), [BiCl3(EO5)] (form A), [BiCl3(EO5)] (form B), [BiI2(EO5)][Bi2I7].2MeOH, and [BiBr2(EO6)][BiBr4].", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "114", "authors": ["ROGERS, RD", "BOND, AH", "AGUINAGA, S", "REYES, A"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00034a032", "issue": "8", "pages": "2967-2977"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1966", "title": "CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF SBI3 AND BII3\n", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KRISTALLOGRAPHIE KRISTALLGEOMETRIE KRISTALLPHYSIK KRISTALLCHEMIE", "volume": "123", "authors": ["TROTTER, J", "ZOBEL, T"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "67-&"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/jo00059a040", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861387510/joceah-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 26 1993", "title": "NEW EFFECTIVE CATALYSTS FOR MUKAIYAMA-ALDOL AND MUKAIYAMA-MICHAEL REACTIONS - BICL3-METALLIC IODIDE SYSTEMS", "abstract": "Metallic iodide-activated bismuth(III) chloride efficiently catalyzes the Mukaiyama-Aldol and -Michael reactions.

The spectra exhibit bands originating from a molecule to five molecular clusters of HgI2 and PbI2, and from a monomer and a dimer of BiI3. The excitation energies are largely shifted to the higher energy side compared with the respective bulk exciton energies, and shift with decreasing the number of molecules, indicating the quantum size effect on the excitation energy.

Exceptional compounds are known, however, which display the \"inert pair effect\": they contain a lone pair of electrons that appear spherically symmetrical and are thus stereochemically inactive. We consider BiI63-, BiCl63- BiI3, and SbI3 as prototypical molecules and solids containing six-coordinate, group 15 atoms with stereochemically active or inactive lone pair electrons on the central atom. Extended Huckel molecular orbital and crystal orbital calculations show an underlying tendency for a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion from octahedral to trigonal coordination of the central atom. The distortion mixes the central atom p(z) character of the unoccupied orbitals with the s character of the HOMO and thus hybridizes the lone pair electrons toward the longer M-X bonds (M = Bi or Sb; X = I or Cl). For the MX3 compounds, the hybrid lone pair points toward the smaller X-M-X angles, and the basic assumption of the VSEPR model is confounded for extended solids. Whether or not the distortion is structurally realized for the BiI63- and BiCl63- molecules depends upon the balance between HOMO-LUMO mixing and (1) the mixing between the HOMO and a lower energy 1a1 orbital with ligand lone pair and Bi p(z) character and (2) repulsions among ligand lone pairs. The HOMO-1a1 mixing is strongest and ligand lone pair-lone pair repulsions are greatest for large, electropositive ligands. HOMO-LUMO mixing predominates for the compounds that display trigonal distortions (BiCl63- and SbI3), but not for those that remain octahedral (BiI63- and BiI3).", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "114", "authors": ["WHEELER, RA", "KUMAR, PNVP"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00038a049", "issue": "12", "pages": "4776-4784"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-2313(88)90045-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022231388900452/pdf?md5=1792082786256753ccb86134109ac74e&pid=1-s2.0-0022231388900452-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 1988", "title": "EXCITONS IN LAYERED BII3 SINGLE-CRYSTALS", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-2313", "pub": "JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE", "volume": "42", "authors": ["KAIFU, Y"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022231388900452", "issue": "2", "pages": "61-81"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja108278j", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 26 2011", "title": "Structural Diversity and Thermochromic Properties of Iodobismuthate Materials Containing d-Metal Coordination Cations: Observation of a High Symmetry [Bi3I11](2-) Anion and of Isolated I- Anions", "abstract": "Six new inorganic-organic salts, all containing iodobismuthate anions and d-metal coordination cations, were synthesized solvothermally from reactions of bismuth iodide, a transition metal (M) nitrate salt (M = Co, Fe or Zn), and a heterocyclic, chelating organic ligand: 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-phen), 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (TMphen), or 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine (tpy).

A discrete dinuclear anion [Sb2Br7(PEt3)2]- is present in this complex with a geometry best described as between face-shared bioctahedral and two square-based pyramids sharing a vertex.", "ISSN": "0300-9246", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY-DALTON TRANSACTIONS", "volume": "N/A", "authors": ["CLEGG, W", "ELSEGOOD, MRJ", "NORMAN, NC", "PICKETT, NL"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1994/DT/dt9940001753", "issue": "12", "pages": "1753-1757"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRev.178.497", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "1969", "title": "ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE STUDY OF CR IONS AND EXCHANGE-COUPLED CR ION PAIRS IN BII3 STRUCTURE", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0031-899X", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW", "volume": "178", "authors": ["BENE, RW"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.178.497", "issue": "2", "pages": "497-&"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.ssc.2006.01.012", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038109806000263/pdfft?md5=9740dabae4d3bb4c1ac29e80af74450f&pid=1-s2.0-S0038109806000263-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 2005", "title": "Bi2O3 rods deposited under atmospheric pressure by means of halide CVD on c-sapphire", "abstract": "Bismuth Oxide (Bi2O3) rods are successfully prepared on delta-Bi2O3 films under atmospheric pressure by means of halide chemical vapour deposition using BiI3 and O-2 as a starting material.

Cr(III) was earlier found to induce oxidative damage as documented by examining the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), an index for DNA damage, in isolated calf thymus DNA incubated with CrCl3 and H2O,. In the present in vitro study, we compared the ability of the free radical scavengers melatonin, N-1-acetyl-N-2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), resveratrol and uric acid to reduce DNA damage induced by Cr(III). Each of these scavengers markedly reduced the DNA damage in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations that reduced 8-OH-dG formation by 50% (IC50) were 0.10 muM for both resveratrol and melatonin, and 0.27 muM for AFMK. However, the efficacy of the fourth endogenous antioxidant, i.e. uric acid, in terms of its inhibition of DNA damage in the same in vitro system was about 60-150 times less effective than the other scavengers; the IC50 for uric acid was 15.24 muM. These findings suggest that three of the four antioxidants tested in these studies may have utility in protecting against the environmental pollutant Cr and that the protective effects of these free radical scavengers against Cr(III)-induced carcinogenesis may relate to their direct hydroxyl radical scavenging ability. In the present study, the formation of 8-OH-dG was likely due to a Cr(III)-mediated Fenton-type reaction that generates hydroxyl radicals, which in turn damage DNA. Once formed, 8-OH-dG can mutate eventually leading to cancer; thus the implication is that these antioxidants may reduce the incidence of Cr-related cancers.

A CrCl3 speciation model in conjunction with kinetics results indicates that the hydrolyzed Cr(III) complex [Cr(H2O)(5)OH](2+) is the most active Cr species in glucose isomerization and probably acts as a Lewis acid-Bronsted base bifunctional site. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations indicate a strong interaction between the Cr cation and the glucose molecule whereby some water molecules are displaced from the first coordination sphere of Cr by the glucose to enable ring-opening and isomerization of glucose. Additionally, complex interactions between the two catalysts are revealed: Bronsted acidity retards aldose-to-ketose isomerization by decreasing the equilibrium concentration of [Cr(H2O)(5)OH](2+). In contrast, Lewis acidity increases the overall rate of consumption of fructose and HMF compared to Bronsted acid catalysis by promoting side reactions. Even in the absence of HCl, hydrolysis of Cr(III) decreases the solution pH, and this intrinsic Bronsted acidity drives the dehydration and rehydration reactions. Yields of 46% levulinic acid in a single phase and 59% HMF in a biphasic system have been achieved at moderate temperatures by combining CrCl3 and HCl.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "135", "authors": ["Choudhary, V", "Mushrif, SH", "Ho, C", "Anderko, A", "Nikolakis, V", "Marinkovic, NS", "Frenkel, AI", "Sandler, SI", "Vlachos, DG"], "issue": "10", "pages": "3997-4006"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAY 2003", "title": "Melatonin, xanthurenic acid, resveratrol, EGCG, vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid differentially reduce oxidative DNA damage induced by Fenton reagents: a study of their individual and synergistic actions", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "DNA damage generated by oxygen-derived free radicals is related to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging. In the last several years, hundreds of publications have confirmed that melatonin is a potent endogenous free radical scavenger. In the present in vitro study, we have examined the efficacy of three polyphenolic antioxidants, i.e. xanthurenic acid, resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans -stilbene) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and two classical non-polyphenolic antioxidants, i.e. vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and alpha-lipoic acid (LA, 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid) in inhibiting (.)

We compared the efficacy of these five antioxidants with the effectiveness of melatonin (N -acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) and we also investigated the possible synergistic effects of melatonin with the other five molecules. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the formation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in purified calf thymus DNA treated with the Fenton reagents, chromium(III) (as CrCl3 ) plus hydrogen peroxide (H-2 O-2 ) (Cr(III)/H-2 O-2 ), was measured in the presence or absence of the antioxidants alone or in combination with melatonin. 8-OH-dG is considered a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage. Among the antioxidants tested, melatonin was the most effective of these with an IC50 = 3.6 +/- 0.1 mu m. For the other antioxidants the IC50 values were as follows: xanthurenic acid (IC50 = 7.9 +/- 0.3), resveratrol (IC50 = 10.9 +/- 0.3), EGCG (IC50 = 5.7 +/- 0.3), vitamin C (IC50 = 16.9 +/- 0.5) and LA (IC50 = 38.8 +/- 0.7).

This trace element is found in the workplace primarily in the valence forms Cr(III) and Cr(VI). Cr(III), which was thought originally to be relatively nontoxic, was recently found to be more reactive toward purified DNA than was chromium(VI). Herein, we examined the ability of Cr(III) to induce oxidative DNA damage by measuring the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in purified calf thymus DNA incubated with CrCl3 plus H2O2. In this system we observed that the Cr(III)-induced formation of 8-OH-dG in isolated DNA was both dose- and time-dependent. When melatonin and related molecules, including 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (pinoline), N-acetylserotonin, 6-hydroxymelatonin and indole-3-propionic acid, were co-incubated with CrCl3 plus H2O2, the accumulations of 8-OH-dG in DNA samples were markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of each indole required to reduce DNA damage by 50%, i.e. the IC50 values, were 0.48, 0.51, 0.88, 1.00 and 3.08 mu M for pinoline, melatonin, N-acetylserotonin, 6-hydroxymelatonin and indole-3-propionic acid, respectively. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which Cr(III) may induce cancer is via Fenton-type reactions which generate the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-.). The findings also indicate that the protective effects of melatonin and related molecules against Cr(III)-induced carcinogenesis relate to their direct (OH)-O-. scavenging ability which thereby reduces the formation of the damaged DNA product, 8-OH-dG.", "ISSN": "0742-3098", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH", "volume": "29", "authors": ["Qi, WB", "Reiter, RJ", "Tan, DX", "Manchester, LC", "Siu, AW", "Garcia, JJ"], "issue": "1", "pages": "54-61"}, {"DOI": "10.1210/me.2005-0255", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 2006", "title": "Chromium activates glucose transporter 4 trafficking and enhances insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via a cholesterol-dependent mechanism", "DOIlink": "http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/me.2005-0255", "abstract": "Evidence suggests that chromium supplementation may alleviate symptoms associated with diabetes, such as high blood glucose and lipid abnormalities, yet a molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that trivalent chromium in the chloride (CrCl3) or picolinate (CrPic) salt forms mobilize the glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Concomitant with an increase in GLUT4 at the plasma membrane, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was enhanced by chromium treatment. In contrast, the chromium-mobilized pool of transporters was not active in the absence of insulin. Microscopic analysis of an exofacially Myc-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein-GLUT4 construct revealed that the chromium-induced accumulation of GLUT4-containing vesicles occurred adjacent to the inner cell surface membrane. With insulin these transporters physically incorporated into the plasma membrane. Regulation of GLUT4 translocation by chromium did not involve known insulin signaling proteins such as the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt. Consistent with a reported effect of chromium on increasing membrane fluidity, we found that chromium treatment decreased plasma membrane cholesterol. Interestingly, cholesterol add-back to the plasma membrane prevented the beneficial effect of chromium on both GLUT4 mobilization and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Furthermore, chromium action was absent in methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-pretreated cells already displaying reduced plasma membrane cholesterol and increased GLUT4 translocation. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism by which chromium may enhance GLUT4 trafficking and insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

CrCl3 was poorly absorbed (estimated 0.13% bioavailability) and rapidly eliminated in urine (excretion half-life, similar to 10 hr), whereas Cr(III)-OJ was absorbed more efficiently (0.60% bioavailability) but more slowly (half-life, similar to 17 hr), and Cr(VI) had the highest bioavailability (6.9%) and the longest half-life (similar to 39 hr). All three chromium mixtures caused temporary elevations in red blood cell (RBC) and plasma chromium concentrations, but the magnitude and duration of elevation showed a clear trend (Cr(VI) > Cr(III)-OJ > CrCl3), The data suggest that nearly all the ingested Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) before entering the bloodstream based on comparison to RBC and plasma chromium patterns in animals exposed to high doses of Cr(VI), These findings support our prior work which suggests that water-soluble organic complexes of Cr(III) formed during the reduction of Cr(VI) in vivo explain the patterns of blood uptake and urinary excretion in humans at drinking water concentrations of 10 mg/liter or less.

The effects of catalyst dosage (mole ratio of catalyst to glucose units in the feedstock) and reaction temperature on HMF yields were investigated to obtain optimal process conditions. With the 1:1 mol ratio of catalyst to glucose unit, the HMF yield reached 62.3% at 160 degrees C for 10 min. Untreated wheat straw was also investigated as feedstock to produce HMF for the practical use of raw biomass, in which the HMF yield was comparable to that from pure cellulose.

Cr(III) is more reactive than Cr(VI) toward DNA under in vitro conditions. In the present study, we investigated the ability of Cr(III) to induce oxidative DNA damage by examining the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in calf thymus DNA incubated with CrCl(3) plus H(2)O(2) We measured 8-OH-dG using HPLC with electrochemical detection. In the presence of H(2)O(2), We observed that Cr(III)-induced formation of 8-OH-dG in isolated DNA was dose and time dependent. Melatonin, ascorbate, and vitamin E (Trolox), all of which are free radical scavengers, markedly inhibited the formation of 8-OH-dG in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration that reduced DNA damage by 50% was 0.51, 30.4, and 36.2 mu M for melatonin, ascorbate, and Trolox, respectively. The results show that melatonin is 60- and 70-fold more effective than ascorbate or vitamin E, respectively, in reducing oxidative DNA damage in this in vitro model. These findings also are consistent with the conclusion that the carcinogenic mechanism of Cr(III) is possibly due to Cr(III)mediated Fenton-type reactions and that melatonin's highly protective effects against Cr(III) relate, at least in part, to its direct hydroxyl radical scavenging ability.", "ISSN": "0091-6765", "pub": "ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES", "volume": "108", "authors": ["Qi, WB", "Reiter, RJ", "Tan, DX", "Garcia, JJ", "Manchester, LC", "Karbownik, M", "Calvo, JR"], "issue": "5", "pages": "399-402"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-1759(77)90198-3", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022175977901983/pdf?md5=dca2fc52cd6ff51e958618f57e700e2d&pid=1-s2.0-0022175977901983-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1977", "title": "SOME METHODOLOGIC ASPECTS OF CHROMIUM CHLORIDE METHOD FOR COUPLING ANTIGEN TO ERYTHROCYTES", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022175977901983", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-1759", "pub": "JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS", "volume": "16", "authors": ["KOFLER, R", "WICK, G"], "issue": "3", "pages": "201-209"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1994", "title": "COMPARATIVE RETENTION ABSORPTION OF CHROMIUM-51 (CR-51) FROM CR-51 CHLORIDE, CR-51 NICOTINATE AND CR-51 PICOLINATE IN A RAT MODEL", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "Recently, there has been a renewed interest in better defining the metabolism of chromium (Cr) with respect to both its absorption and cellular action.  In the current study we investigated the absorption/retention of 3 Cr(III) compounds (Cr chloride [CrCl], Cr nicotinate [CrNic], Cr picolinate [CrPic]) over a 12 h period in a rat model.  Male rats (150 - 170 g) were gavaged with 44 muCi (2.7 nmoles) Cr-51 as CrCl3 x 6 H2O, CrNic or CrPic.  Rats were killed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 h post-gavage.  Cardiac blood was collected and liver, kidneys, pancreas, testes, and gastrocnemius were removed, weighted and assayed for Cr-51.  The amount of Cr-51 in these tissues, along with that in urine (collected for the 6 and 12 h groups), was used to calculate Cr-51 absorbed/retained.  Urine, followed by muscle and blood, had the highest percent of absorbed/retained counts.  For the majority of the time points and tissues, the average percent Cr-51 retained was higher in CrNic-gavaged rats than in CrCl- or CrPic-gavaged rats.  Tissues collected 1 h post-gavage from CrNic rats had retention percentages that were 3.2 to 8.4- fold higher than in the CrPic or CrCl groups.  Three h post-gavage, CrNic rats had blood, muscle, and pancreatic Cr-51 retentions that were 2.4 to 8 times higher than CrPic-gavaged rats.  By 6 and 12 h post-gavage, the ''absorbed/retined'' tissues were 1.8 to 3.8 times higher in CrNic than in CrPic rats.

The proposed model is constituted by 2 kinds of elementary reactions: the one is that 2LiNH(2) decomposes to Li2NH and ammonia (NH3) the other is that the emitted NH3 reacts with LiH and transforms into LiNH2 and H-2. Since the former and the latter reactions are, respectively, endothermic and exothermic, the HD reaction corresponding to the latter reaction occurs as soon as LiNH2 has decomposed into Li2NH and NH3. Therefore, the HD reaction can be understood by the following processes: at the first step, LiNH2 decomposes into Li2NH/(2) + NH3/2, and then the emitted NH3/2 quickly reacts with LiH/2, transforming into LiNH2/2 + H-2/2; at the second one, the produced LiNH2/2 decomposes to Li2NH/4 + NH3/4, and then NH3/4 + LiH/4 transform to LiNH2/4 + H-2/4, and such successive steps continue until LiNH2 and LiH completely transform into Li2NH and H-2, even at low temperatures, by the catalytic effect of TiCl3.(.)", "ISSN": "1520-6106", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B", "volume": "108", "authors": ["Ichikawa, T", "Hanada, N", "Isobe, S", "Leng, HY", "Fujii, H"], "issue": "23", "pages": "7887-7892"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 26 1995", "title": "CARBONYL COUPLING REACTIONS CATALYTIC IN TITANIUM AND THE USE OF COMMERCIAL TITANIUM POWDER FOR ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The high thermodynamic stability of titanium oxides formed as the inorganic byproducts in McMurry-type reactions has so far prevented the development of a catalytic procedure for such reductive carbonyl coupling processes. Similarly, a tightly bound oxide layer passivates the surface of commercial titanium, which is unreactive toward organic substrates under conventional conditions. This paper outlines a way to overcome both of these problems. Thus, oxoamides 1a-h can be reductively cyclized to indoles 2a-h using only catalytic amounts of low-valent titanium if the reaction is carried out in the presence of a chlorosilane. Specifically, the method is based upon the in situ generation of an activated titanium species from TiCl3 and Zn in the presence of the substrate, followed by regeneration of titanium chloride from the titanium oxides formed via ligand exchange with the admired chlorosilane. Its proper choice is crucial for obtaining both good turnover numbers and clean conversions. Depending on the product structure, (TMS)Cl, ClMe(2)SiCH(2)CH(2)SiMe(2)Cl (5), or ClMe(2)Si(CH2)(3)CN (6) was found to be best suited. Similarly, chlorosilanes also effect the activation of commercial titanium powder which may then be used as a performant off-the-shelf reagent for various types of carbonyl and acetal coupling reactions, for the deoxygenation of epoxides and for the reductive cyclization of oxoamides or oxoesters to indoles, benzofurans, and 2-quinolones. Under these conditions retinal can be reductively dimerized to beta-carotene in good yield. Moreover, the titanium/ chlorosilane reagent combination exhibits a strong template effect, allowing macrocyclization reactions without recourse to high dilution. Up to 36-membered rings have been closed in that way. Si-29 NMR studies provide some insight into the elementary steps responsible for the degradation of the surface oxide layer on titanium by the chlorosilane.

At high temperature and low H-2 pressure, direct LiBH4 decomposition is both thermodynamically allowed and kinetically favored; thus, the second dehydrogenation step from LiBH4 produced LiH and amorphous boron along with the Mg metal from the first step. From this state, recombination of LiH with amorphous boron had very poor kinetics and the system did not fully rehydrogenate. Applying an H-2 gas overpressure of at least 3 bar during dehydrogenation, however, suppressed direct decomposition of LiBH4 and reaction of Mg with LiBH4 produced LiH and MgB2, which was fully reversible.", "ISSN": "1932-7447", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C", "volume": "111", "authors": ["Pinkerton, FE", "Meyer, MS", "Meisner, GP", "Balogh, MP", "Vajo, JJ"], "issue": "35", "pages": "12881-12885"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/b403657n", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2004", "title": "Combined TEM-EDX and XAFS studies of Ti-doped sodium alanate", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2004/CP/b403657n", "abstract": "In context of investigations of doped sodium alanate as a hydrogen storage material, an investigation combining a TEM-EDX study and XAFS measurements has been carried out on doped sodium alanate, using titanium tetrabutylate (Ti(OBun)(4)), colloidal titanium nanoparticles (Ti*) or TiCl3 as doping agents. It was found that the dehydrogenated wet-chemically Ti(OBun)(4) doped NaAlH4 consists of a crystalline Al and an amorphous NaH phase. The striking result of EDX analyses is that in each case the Ti-dopant is found to be present only in the Al phase. On the other hand, dehydrogenated NaAlH4 doped with Ti* or TiCl3 via ball milling is an amorphous material, with diffuse boundaries between Al and NaH phases and a highly uniform distribution of titanium in the Al-phase. Both the use of the ball milling doping method and of Ti* nanoparticles as dopants, are probable reasons for the outstanding kinetics of the Ti* doped material (B. Bogdanovic, M. Felderhoff, S. Kaskel, A. Pommerin, K. Schlichte and F. Schuth, Adv. Mater., 2003, 15, 1012; M. Fichtner, O. Fuhr, O. Kircher and J. Rothe, Nanotechnology, 2003, 14, 778). The course of hydrogen dis- and recharging reactions is discussed in light of the present TEM-EDX and the preceding XRD investigations of storage materials. Ti-EXAFS and XANES spectra of Ti-doped NaAlH4 after the doping, after several, and after 100 de- and rehydrogenation cycles are very close to each other. Apparently, after the Ti-doping, a zerovalent Ti species is formed which remains almost unchanged in the course of the cycle test. The XAFS spectra indicate that Ti is largely atomically dispersed in the Al phase, i.e. forms an Al-Ti alloy, thus confirming the earlier hypothesis (V.P. Balema, J.W. Wiench, K.W.M. Dennis, M.

For ring-opening reactions we distinguish between agostic assisted beta-hydrogen transfer and hydride formation. With the B3LYP functional it was found that the rate-determining step is the ring-opening reaction of the seven-membered metallacycle, exhibiting a barrier DeltaGdagger(298.15 K) of 18.4 kcal/mol. It appears that the selectivity of the reaction results from two effects: the stabilizing effect of the hemilabile phenyl ligand and the ring size of the metallacycle.

When they are implanted inside a body, metallic biomaterials may corrode and/or wear, releasing metal ions and debris which may have toxic effects on tissues and organs. Since it is important for biomaterials to have no toxicity against a living body, a systematic and quantitative evaluation of the cytotoxicity of metallic elements is required for the development of new metallic biomaterials with superior biocompatibility. In this study, the cytotoxicity of 43 metal salts were evaluated by the colony formation method using two kinds of cultured cells. The effects of the difference in valence numbers of metallic elements in the salts on cytotoxicity were examined. The cytotoxicity of the salts of metallic elements' oxo acids was also investigated. As a result, the intensity of metal salts' cytotoxicity tends to be quite similar between MC3T3-E1 and L929 (the correlation coefficient of metal salts' IC(50)s is 0.82). The intensity of metal salts' cytotoxicity depends on the kinds of metallic elements, their chemical states, and concentrations. The IC50 of the highest toxic salt is 1.36 x 10(-6) mol L-1, which differs four orders of magnitude from the IC50 of the lowest toxic salt. K2Cr2O7, CdCl2, VCl3, AgNO3, HgCl2, SbCl3, BeSO4, and InCl3 are high toxic salts in which IC(50)s are smaller then 10(-5) mol L-1 for both or either of the cell Lines. HgCl, Tl(NO3)(3), GaCl3, CuCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2, ZnCl2, NiCl2, SnCl2, IrCl4, TlNO3, CuCl, RhCl3, Pb(NO3)(2), Cr(NO3)(3) and Bi(NO3)(3) are relatively high toxic salts in which IC(50)s are smaller than 10(-4) mol L-1 for both or either cell Lines.

This new trivalent compound is a potent ethylene polymerization precatalyst, and polymers produced by the complex activated with PMAO showed a bimodal character in the GPC. Its bimodality is tentatively explained with the existence of two catalytically active species (mono and dialkylation of the vanadium center).

A catalytic effect due to the transition metal shell material has been observed, where solid state ion-ion exchange takes place, thus allowing penetration into the MgO or CaO particles and thereby regenerating the transition metal oxide for additional catalytic action. Due to this catalytic effect, the destructive adsorption reaction became nearly stoichiometric, and therefore much higher capacities for destruction/immobilization of the adsorbate under study were realized; For example, the reaction CCl4 + [V2O5]MgO --> CO2 + [V2O5]MgCl2 is greatly enhanced by the presence of the V2O5, and VCl5 or VCl3 appear to be intermediates in the process. The catalytic effects are proposed to be due to the intermediacy of transition metal chlorides, phosphates, or sulfites, which are mobile and seek out reactive sites on the MgO or CaO nanoparticles where ion-ion exchange can most readily take place, thereby regenerating the transition metaloxide catalyst.

Ab initio calculations on the latter show that the bonding of the bis(iminophosphoranyl)methanide ligand to nickel involves pi delocalisation over the N2P2C framework as well as sigma bonding between nickel and the P2CH carbon atom. Bis(iminophosphoranyl)pyridines C5H3N(R2P=NR')(2)-2,6 (R=Ph or cyclohexyl, R'=C6H2Me3-2,4,6, C6H3Pr2i-2,6 or SiMe3) reacted with VCl3(thf)(3), FeX2 (X=Cl or Br) or CoCl2 to give the corresponding octahedral (V) or five-co-ordinate (Fe, Co) complexes. The crystal structure of FeBr2{C5H3N(Ph2P=NSiMe3)(2)-2,6} has been determined; the complex is trigonal bipyramidal. In the presence of methylaluminoxane [MeAlO](n), cobalt complexes of bis(aryliminophosphoranyl)methane are moderately active in ethene polymerisation, while bis(iminophosphoranyl)pyridine iron complexes show only low activity. The vanadium complexes polymerise ethene under ambient conditions and give polymers of very high molecular weight.", "ISSN": "1470-479X", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY-DALTON TRANSACTIONS", "volume": "N/A", "authors": ["Al-Benna, S", "Sarsfield, MJ", "Thornton-Pett, M", "Ormsby, DL", "Maddox, PJ", "Bres, P", "Bochmann, M"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2000/DT/b006329k", "issue": "23", "pages": "4247-4257"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ic00011a009", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860116614/inocaj-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 29 1991", "title": "PYRIDINE AND RELATED ADDUCTS, (SILOX)3ML (M = SC, TI, V, TA) - ETA-1-PYRIDINE-N VS ETA-2-PYRIDINE-N,C LIGATION", "abstract": "Adducts of (silox)3M (M = Ta (1), Ti (2), Sc (3), V (4)) have been prepared in order to assess the various electronic factors responsible for eta-1-pyridine-N vs. eta-2-pyridine-N,C ligation.  Treatment of ScCl3(THF)3 or VCl3 with 3 equiv of Na(silox) in THF yielded (silox)3M(THF) (M = Sc (3-THF), V (4-THF)), and exposure of [(Me3Si)2N]3Sc to 5 equiv of (silox)H provided (silox)3ScNH3 (3-NH3), but the bases could not be removed.  Addition of C2H4, C2H3Me, 1-butene, and cis-2-butene to 1 afforded (silox)3Ta(olefin) (olefin = C2H4 (5a), C2H3Me (5b), C2H3Et (5c), cis-MeHC=CHMe (5d)), although cyclometalation to give (silox)2H activated TaOSi(t)Bu2CMe2CH2 (6) competed with the latter two.  In concentrated benzene solution (approximately 0.10 M), 1 trapped C6H6 to yield [(silox)3Ta]2{mu-eta-2(1,2):eta-2(4,5)-C6H6} (7; approximately 7%) along with 6.  Acetylene, 2-butyne, and F3CC=CCF3 reacted with 1 to give (silox)3Ta(alkyne) (alkyne = C2H2 (8a), C2Me2 (8b), C2(CF3)2 (8c)).  Ethylene did not displace the THF and NH3 from 3-THF, 3-NH3, and 4-THF, but reacted with 2 to provide [(silox)3Ti]2(mu-C2H4) (9).  Treatment of 1 with pyridine, 2-picoline, 2,6-lutidine, pyridazine (1,2-N2C4H4) and pyrimidine (1,3-N2C4H4) provided (silox)3Ta(eta-2-NC5H5-N,C) (10a), (silox)3Ta(eta-2-6-NC5H4Me-N,C) (10b), (silox)3Ta(eta-2-2,6-NC5H3Me2-N,C) (11b), (silox)3Ta(eta-2-N2C4H4-N,N') (12), and (silox)3Ta(eta-2-1,3-N2C4H4-N1,C6) (13), respectively.  Formation of these eta-2-heterocyclic adducts is proposed to occur via nucleophilic attack by 1 at the LUMO (predominantly C=N pi*) of the substrate, a process consistent with the generation of the pyridyl hydride (silox)3Ta(H)(C5H2Me2N) (11a) from 2,6-lutidine prior to equilibration with 11b.  Similar treatments of 2 yielded (silox)3Ti(eta-1-py) (2-py) and related eta-1-py derivatives of 3,5-lutidine (2-3,5-NC5H3Me2), 4-picoline (2-4-NC5H4Me), and 4-NC5H4(t)Bu (2-4-NC5H4(t)Bu).  Upon application of the McConnell equation to a(H) values obtained from the H-1 contact shifts of 2-py, the following spin density probabilities were obtained:  rho-2(2,6) = 0.13%; rho-2(3,5) = 0.01%; rho-2(4) = 0.16%.  eta-1-Pyridine adducts (silox)3M(py) (M = Sc (3-py), V (4-py)) were produced upon exposure of (silox)3M(THF) to py.  Interpretation of the UV-vis spectrum of 1 and EHMO calculations of eta-1 and eta-2 forms of (silox)3Ta(py) provide a rationale for the variation in pyridine ligation.  Of critical importance are the four-electron repulsion between the filled d(z)2 orbital of 1 and the py N-donor orbital and the capability of pyridine to function as a good pi-acceptor in the eta-2-mode.", "ISSN": "0020-1669", "pub": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "volume": "30", "authors": ["COVERT, KJ", "NEITHAMER, DR", "ZONNEVYLLE, MC", "LAPOINTE, RE", "SCHALLER, CP", "WOLCZANSKI, PT"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic00011a009", "issue": "11", "pages": "2494-2508"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja00541a029", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "1980", "title": "AN EFFICIENT PHOTO-CATHODE FOR SEMICONDUCTOR LIQUID JUNCTION CELLS - 9.4-PERCENT SOLAR CONVERSION EFFICIENCY WITH P-INP-VCL3-VCL2-HCL-C", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "102", "authors": ["HELLER, A", "MILLER, B", "LEWERENZ, HJ", "BACHMANN, KJ"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00541a029", "issue": "21", "pages": "6555-6556"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.mseb.2003.10.114", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921510703005415/pdfft?md5=e233f01399818b5afacc688407099d64&pid=1-s2.0-S0921510703005415-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 25 2004", "title": "Desorption of LiAlH4 with Ti- and V-based additives", "abstract": "Thermal desorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments show that ball-milling of LiAlD4 in presence of VCl3 or TiCl3 (.) 1/3(AlCl3) can reduce its thermal decomposition temperatures by 60 and 50degreesC, respectively.

S-Nitrosothiols were exposed to saturated VCl3 in HCl, 1% KI in acetic acid, photolysis, or CuCl and CSH in He; NO was measured by chemiluminescence, S-Nitrosothiols were readily detected in VCl3 but not in KI. Reduction in CuCl/cysteine was linear (r(2) = 1.0, n = 6), sensitive to 10 pmol, and eliminated by HgCl2; it did not detect NO2- NO3- or 3-nitrotyrosine. S-Nitrosothiols represented similar to 2.9% of NOx assayed by VCl3 in human serum, of which <5% were low-mass species. In summary, (i) conventional assays may misidentify NO3-, but not NO2- as SNOs; and (ii) chemiluminescence/reduction systems may be sensitive and specific as SNO assays.

Among the reducing agents tested, ascorbate afforded the highest selectivity and reactivity to phenol. With other reductants, such as dithioalcohols, high selectivity (>96%) was obtained toward more oxidised products (i.e. hydroquinone). The reactions were performed in the two-phase system formed by mixing water/acetonitrile/benzene which allows a good separation between reactant and product. The reaction rate and product selectivity depend upon the type of ligand interacting with vanadium as well as upon the ascorbate/V molar ratio. ESR measurements confirmed that V-IV species is rapidly formed in the reaction medium after the initial addition Of (VCl3)-Cl-III. Moreover, the observed initial induction period of benzene oxidation can be related to the formation of olicomeric V-IV species, as assessed by ESR analysis, rather than to the slow formation of V-ascorbate complex.

The biphasic reaction of an aqueous solution of ammonium vanadate and a dichloromethane solution of hexamethylphosphoramide (hmpa) and pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (pcaH) or pyrazine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (pdcaH(2)) or pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (pycaH(2)) yields yellow crystals of [VO2(pca)(hmpa)] (1), [(VO2)(2)(pdca)(hmpa)(2)] (2), and [VO2(pycaH)(hmpa)] (3), respectively. The single-crystal X-ray structure analyses reveal 1 and 3 to be mononuclear vanadium(V) complexes, in which a VO2 unit coordinates to one nitrogen and one oxygen atom of a pea or pycaH chelating ligand, and 2 to be a dinuclear vanadium(V) complex, in which two VO2 units are coordinated through one nitrogen and one oxygen atom of a pdca bridging ligand; in the three complexes the vanadium atoms also coordinate to the oxygen atom of a hmpa ligand. The reaction of N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)-2-hydroxo-1,3-diaminopropane (hptbH) and VOSO4 in methanol gives the cationic complex [(VO)(4)(hptb)(2)(pO)](4+) (4), which can be crystallized as the perchlorate salt. In this tetranuclear complex, two dinuclear vanadium(IV) units are held together by a mu-oxo bridge. The known complex [VOCl2(tmtacn)] (5) was synthesized from the reaction of 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (tmtacn) and VCl3 in acetonitrile; the reaction of tetrabutylammonium vanadate with pyro-cathecol (catH(2)) in acetonitrile gives the known anionic complex [V(cat)(3)](-) (6), in which the vanadium(V) center is bonded to three cat chelating ligands through the oxygen atoms, obtained as the tetrabutylammonium salt. All compounds synthesized are highly efficient oxidation catalysts for the reaction of cyclohexane with air and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of four equivalents of pcaH per vanadium, although the catalytic activity of the complexes containing bulky chelating ligands 4 and 5 is somewhat lower in the initial period of the reaction. During this period the active species are formed from the complexes and final turnover numbers are high. The catecholate ligands of complex 6 may reduce from V(V) to V(IV) in the beginning of the process, thus providing very high initial oxidation rates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Reaction of the lithium salts of the ligands with ScCl3. 3THF leads to the complexes LScCl2(THF)(n), which may be readily alkylated to form the dialkyl derivatives. Most are isolated as base-free, four-coordinate complexes. Several have been characterized via X-ray crystallography, and a detailed discussion of their structures is presented. Steric interactions between Ar and the Sc-alkyl groups force the scandium to adopt an out-of-plane bonding mode. In solution, this is manifested via a fluxional process which equilibrates the two diastereotopic alkyl groups and ligand groups as well. The barriers to this process roughly correlate with the steric bulk of the alkyl substituents. At elevated temperatures, the dialkyl derivatives LScR2 undergo a metalation process whereby one of the alkyl groups is eliminated as RH, and a ligand iPr group is metalated in the methyl position.

Treatment of ScCl3(THF)3 or VCl3 with 3 equiv of Na(silox) in THF yielded (silox)3M(THF) (M = Sc (3-THF), V (4-THF)), and exposure of [(Me3Si)2N]3Sc to 5 equiv of (silox)H provided (silox)3ScNH3 (3-NH3), but the bases could not be removed.  Addition of C2H4, C2H3Me, 1-butene, and cis-2-butene to 1 afforded (silox)3Ta(olefin) (olefin = C2H4 (5a), C2H3Me (5b), C2H3Et (5c), cis-MeHC=CHMe (5d)), although cyclometalation to give (silox)2H activated TaOSi(t)Bu2CMe2CH2 (6) competed with the latter two.  In concentrated benzene solution (approximately 0.10 M), 1 trapped C6H6 to yield [(silox)3Ta]2{mu-eta-2(1,2):eta-2(4,5)-C6H6} (7; approximately 7%) along with 6.  Acetylene, 2-butyne, and F3CC=CCF3 reacted with 1 to give (silox)3Ta(alkyne) (alkyne = C2H2 (8a), C2Me2 (8b), C2(CF3)2 (8c)).  Ethylene did not displace the THF and NH3 from 3-THF, 3-NH3, and 4-THF, but reacted with 2 to provide [(silox)3Ti]2(mu-C2H4) (9).  Treatment of 1 with pyridine, 2-picoline, 2,6-lutidine, pyridazine (1,2-N2C4H4) and pyrimidine (1,3-N2C4H4) provided (silox)3Ta(eta-2-NC5H5-N,C) (10a), (silox)3Ta(eta-2-6-NC5H4Me-N,C) (10b), (silox)3Ta(eta-2-2,6-NC5H3Me2-N,C) (11b), (silox)3Ta(eta-2-N2C4H4-N,N') (12), and (silox)3Ta(eta-2-1,3-N2C4H4-N1,C6) (13), respectively.  Formation of these eta-2-heterocyclic adducts is proposed to occur via nucleophilic attack by 1 at the LUMO (predominantly C=N pi*) of the substrate, a process consistent with the generation of the pyridyl hydride (silox)3Ta(H)(C5H2Me2N) (11a) from 2,6-lutidine prior to equilibration with 11b.  Similar treatments of 2 yielded (silox)3Ti(eta-1-py) (2-py) and related eta-1-py derivatives of 3,5-lutidine (2-3,5-NC5H3Me2), 4-picoline (2-4-NC5H4Me), and 4-NC5H4(t)Bu (2-4-NC5H4(t)Bu).  Upon application of the McConnell equation to a(H) values obtained from the H-1 contact shifts of 2-py, the following spin density probabilities were obtained:  rho-2(2,6) = 0.13%; rho-2(3,5) = 0.01%; rho-2(4) = 0.16%.  eta-1-Pyridine adducts (silox)3M(py) (M = Sc (3-py), V (4-py)) were produced upon exposure of (silox)3M(THF) to py.  Interpretation of the UV-vis spectrum of 1 and EHMO calculations of eta-1 and eta-2 forms of (silox)3Ta(py) provide a rationale for the variation in pyridine ligation.  Of critical importance are the four-electron repulsion between the filled d(z)2 orbital of 1 and the py N-donor orbital and the capability of pyridine to function as a good pi-acceptor in the eta-2-mode.", "ISSN": "0020-1669", "pub": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "volume": "30", "authors": ["COVERT, KJ", "NEITHAMER, DR", "ZONNEVYLLE, MC", "LAPOINTE, RE", "SCHALLER, CP", "WOLCZANSKI, PT"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic00011a009", "issue": "11", "pages": "2494-2508"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0022-328X(96)06768-X", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022328X9606768X/pdf?md5=b5fd89227686c82dd290f9e655b9405a&pid=1-s2.0-S0022328X9606768X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 1 1997", "title": "Highly electron deficient Group 3 organometallic complexes based on the 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane ligand system", "abstract": "Reaction of the neutral ligand 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (Cn) with MCl3(THF)(3) (M = Sc, Y) in acetonitrile affords the novel trihalide complexes CnMCl(3).

The compound has been studied using a combination of in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and vibrational and NMR spectroscopy. NaSc(BH4)(4) forms at ambient conditions in ball-milled mixtures of sodium borohydride and ScCl3. A new tertiary chloride Na3ScCl6 (P2(1)/n, a = 6.7375(3) angstrom, b = 7.1567(3) angstrom, c = 9,9316(5) angstrom, beta = 90.491(3)degrees, V = 478.87(4) angstrom(3)), isostructural to Na3TiCl6, was identified as an additional phase in all samples. This indicates that the formation of NaSc(BH4)(4) differs from a simple metathesis reaction, and the highest scandium borohydride yield (22 wt %) was obtained with a reactant ratio of ScCl3/NaBH4 of 1:2. NaSc(BH4)(4) crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group symmetry Cmcm (a = 8.170(2) angstrom, b = 11.875(3) angstrom, c = 9.018(2) angstrom, V = 874.9(3) angstrom(3)). The Structure of NaSc(BH4)(4) consists of isolated homoleptic scandium tetraborohydride anions, [Sc(BH4)(4)](-), located inside slightly distorted trigonal Na-6 prisms (each second prism is empty, triangular angles of 55.5 and 69.1 degrees). The experimental results show that each Sc3+ is tetrahedrally Surrounded by four BH4 tetrahedra with a 12-fold coordination of H to Sc, while Na+ is surrounded by six BH4 tetrahedra in a quite regular octahedral coordination with a (6 + 12)-fold coordination of H to Na.

The MMA polymerization in the presence of scandium trifluoromethanesulfonate [Sc(OTf)(3)] in toluene or CHCl3 produced a polymer with a higher isotacticity and heterotacticity than that produced in the absence of Sc(OTf)(3). Similar effects were observed during the polymerization of the other monomers. ScCl3, Yb(OTf)(3), Er(OTf)(3), HfCl4, HfBr4, and In(OTf)(3) also increased the isotacticity and heterotacticity of the polymers. The effects of the Lewis acids were greater in a solvent with a lower polarity and were negligible in tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide.

The title compound, KSc(BH4)(4), forms at ambient conditions in ball milled mixtures of potassium borohydride and ScCl3 together with a new ternary chloride K3ScCl6, which is also structurally characterized. This indicates that the formation of KSc(BH4)(4) differs from a simple metathesis reaction, and the highest scandium borohydride yield (similar to 31 mol %) can be obtained with a reactant ratio KBH4:ScCl3 of 2:1. KSc(BH4)(4) crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, a = 11.856(5), b = 7.800(3), c = 10.126(6) angstrom, v = 936.4(8) angstrom(3) at RT, with the space group symmetry Prima. KSc(BH4)(4) has a BaSO4 type structure where the BH4 tetrahedra take the oxygen positions. Regarding the packing of cations, K+, and complex anions, [Sc(BH4)(4)](-), the structure of KSc(BH4)(4) can be seen as a distorted variant of orthorhombic neptunium, Np, metal.

KSc(BH4)(4) is stable from RT up to similar to 405 K, where the compound melts and then releases hydrogen in two rapid steps approximately at 460-500 K and 510-590 K. The hydrogen release involves the formation of KBH4, which reacts with K3ScCl6 and forms a solid solution, K(BH4)(1-x)Cl-x.

The method has been published until now only for TiCl3 as a doping agent. In combination with ScCl3 or CeCl3 as doping agents, the one-step direct synthesis method delivers materials with hydrogen storage properties which come close to those required by the car industry for hydrogen supply of PEM fuel cells. With respect to the kinetics of the chemical reaction, hydrogenation rates corresponding to 3-5 min time for refuelling of a hydrogen tank can be realized, although removal of the resulting hydrogenation heat in such a short time posses a severe engineering problem. Release of all stored hydrogen in a time compatible with handling of a car is possible without additional heating devices, if instead of the current fuel cells, advanced designs on the basis of polybenzimidazole membranes are used. These fuel cells work at temperatures of 150-200 degrees C, so that their waste heat temperature level is sufficiently high for desorption of hydrogen from both dehydrogenation steps of the NaAlH4 system. Additionally, it has been reported that using mischmetal with 42 at.% of Ce as a dopant for NaAlH4, at 150 degrees C, similar to 5 wt.% of hydrogen can be desorbed in similar to 3 h. Moreover, in a 95 cycles de- and re-hydrogenation test the present Ce-doped NaAlH4 storage material showed stable storage properties. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Raman spectroscopic data suggest that the hexaaqua Sc(III) ion is stable in perchlorate solution within the concentration range measured. Furthermore, the frequency data confirm the centrosymmetry of the Sc(III) aqua complex, contrary to earlier Raman results. The ScO6 unit possesses. O-h symmetry (water seen as point mass).

These simulations, which use polarizable ion interaction models, have previously been shown to predict structural properties in excellent agreement with diffraction experiments. The dependence of the polarizability of the melt on the ionic positions, which determines the Raman spectrum through the time dependence of the polarizability correlation function, is modeled on the basis of ab initio electronic structure calculations carried out on alkali chlorides. New simulation techniques are introduced in order to allow the spectrum to be calculated with acceptable statistics. The calculated spectra are in semiquantitative agreement with experimental data. The distinctive bands which appear in the spectra of such complex melts are linked to the vibrations of the transient coordination complexes which form in these melts and new interpretations for the origin of several well-known features are proposed. The simulations thus enable a link between the structure of a melt as perceived through Raman spectroscopy and through diffraction experiments to be made.

The systematics of the Raman spectra indicate that in melt mixtures rich in KCl the predominant species are GdCl63- octahedra, while at higher GdCl3 mole fraction edge bridging of the octahedra occurs. At all compositions including the pure GdCl3 melt the gadolinium coordination is presumably six-fold. The electronic absorption spectra of Ho3+ in molten LiCl, CsCl and LiCl-KCl eutectic have been measured. The data suggest that the predominant factor affecting the intensities of the Ho3+ hypersensitive transitions is the degree of octahedral distortions in conjunction with the overall symmetry around the HoCl63-. Changes of the electron donating ability of the Cl- ligands by the polarizing power of the alkali metal counter cations do not affect drastically the f <-- f intensities. Electronic absorption spectral measurements of Ho3+ centers in different GdCl3-KCl molten mixtures show that the hypersensitive band intensities increase with increasing GdCl3 mole fraction. These changes are attributed to increasing octahedral distortion imposed on the HoCl63- octahedra by the host melt.

This, along with the modularity of their synthesis determines their coordination chemistry. The possibility to combine oxazolines, in which the stereogenic centers adjacent to the N-donor atoms have different absolute configuration, whilst retaining their ability to coordinate as tripodal ligands, has been demonstrated by the synthesis of the enantiomerically pure C-3-symmetric iPr-trisox(S,S,S) and C-1-symmetric iPr-trisox(S,S,R) and their reaction with [Mo(CO)(3)(NCMe)(3)] yielding [Mo{iPr-trisox(S,S,S)CO)(3)] (1a) and [Mo{iPr-trisox(S,S,R)}(CO)(3)] (1b), respectively. The non-autocomplementarity of two homochiral trisox ligands at one metal center has been demonstrated by reaction of rac-C-3 iPr-trisox with one equivalent of [Co(ClO4)(2)].6H(2)O, giving the centrosymmetric heterochiral complex [Co(iPr-trisox)(2)](ClO4)(2) (3), whereas an analogous reaction with the enantiopure ligand yielded a mixture of Con complexes, which is characterized by the total absence of a [(trisox)(2)Co](+/2+) ion. The scope of the trisox ligand in terms of facial coordination to both early and late transition metals was demonstrated by the synthesis and structural characterization of the mononuclear complexes [SCCl3(iPr-trisox)] (4), [Fe(tBu-trisox)(NCMe)(3)](BF4)(2) (5), and [Ru(eta(6)-p-cymene)(iPr-trisox)]-(PF6)(2) (6). The facial coordination of their three ligating atoms to a metal center may be impeded if the transition-metal center stereoelectronically strongly favors a non-deltahedral coordination sphere, which is generally the case for the heavier d(8)-transition-metal atoms/ions. Reaction of iPr-trisox with [Rh(cod)(2)]BF4 led to the formation of the 16-electron d(8)-configured complex [Rh(iPr-trisox) (cod)] (BF4) (7), which is oxidized by CsBr3 to give the Rh-III complex [RhBr3(iPr-trisox)] (8) possessing a C-3-symmetric structure with a kappa(3)-N-trisox ligand.

All dinuclear complexes display weak magnetic coupling.

This method was then applied to directly compare different additives during synthesis. The following trend was obtained for the effectiveness of the additives: TiCl3 > CeCl3 > SCCl3 >> Ti. This trend was also verified for desorption by differential scanning calorimetry and by monitoring decomposition at room temperature during long-term storage. In addition, the direct comparison by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the chemical state of the additive after milling illustrated indirectly the importance of the reduction of the chloride-and the formation of NaCl-during synthesis.

The reaction of 4-CF3C6H4CN2(SiMe3)3 with PhSCl in a 1:3 molar ratio produces the eight-membered ring (4-CF3C6H4)2C2N4S2Ph2, as a minor product, in addition to the isomeric diazene.

The films were characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy for crystalline quality and epitaxial growth on the substrates. The surface morphology and microstructure were examined using scanning electron microscopy. X-ray mapping and energy-dispersive spectroscopy were performed to determine nonstoichiometry in the composition and homogeneity. The quality of the films, in terms of stoichiometric composition and crystal perfection, was studied as a function of growth temperature and laser fluence. The values of the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, and Hall mobility in the thin films were measured and compared with those in the bulk. Thermoelectric figure of merit of the films was evaluated from the measured parameters. Correlation of the thermoelectric properties, with the crystalline quality and stoichiometric composition of the films, showed the advantages of pulsed laser deposition of the multicomponent thermoelectric thin films. The results illustrate that laser physical vapor deposition is a suitable choice for deposition of multicomponent thermoelectric films. However, optimization of target composition, substrate temperature, and annealing of the films after deposition were found necessary to maintain the desired stoichiometry and low defect density. AlN/Si substrates provided better quality films compared to substrates of mica. Poor adhesion and cracking of the films on mica were found to be detrimental factors. Films deposited on AlN/Si substrates were found to show higher carrier mobility and higher values of Seebeck coefficient.

Exceptional compounds are known, however, which display the \"inert pair effect\": they contain a lone pair of electrons that appear spherically symmetrical and are thus stereochemically inactive. We consider BiI63-, BiCl63- BiI3, and SbI3 as prototypical molecules and solids containing six-coordinate, group 15 atoms with stereochemically active or inactive lone pair electrons on the central atom. Extended Huckel molecular orbital and crystal orbital calculations show an underlying tendency for a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion from octahedral to trigonal coordination of the central atom. The distortion mixes the central atom p(z) character of the unoccupied orbitals with the s character of the HOMO and thus hybridizes the lone pair electrons toward the longer M-X bonds (M = Bi or Sb; X = I or Cl). For the MX3 compounds, the hybrid lone pair points toward the smaller X-M-X angles, and the basic assumption of the VSEPR model is confounded for extended solids. Whether or not the distortion is structurally realized for the BiI63- and BiCl63- molecules depends upon the balance between HOMO-LUMO mixing and (1) the mixing between the HOMO and a lower energy 1a1 orbital with ligand lone pair and Bi p(z) character and (2) repulsions among ligand lone pairs. The HOMO-1a1 mixing is strongest and ligand lone pair-lone pair repulsions are greatest for large, electropositive ligands. HOMO-LUMO mixing predominates for the compounds that display trigonal distortions (BiCl63- and SbI3), but not for those that remain octahedral (BiI63- and BiI3).", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "114", "authors": ["WHEELER, RA", "KUMAR, PNVP"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00038a049", "issue": "12", "pages": "4776-4784"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/b100782n", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2001", "title": "Synthesis and structural studies on polymeric assemblies derived from antimony(III) halide complexes with bi- and tri-dentate and macrocyclic thio- and seleno-ether ligands", "abstract": "SbX3 (X=Cl, Br or in some cases I) reacts with one molar equivalent of L [L=MeS(CH2)(2)SMe, MeS(CH2)(3)SMe, MeSe(CH2)(2)SeMe, MeC(CH2SMe)(3), MeC(CH2SeMe)(3), [12]aneS(4) (1,4,7,10-tetrathiacyclododecane), [14]aneS(4) (1,4,8,11-tetrathiacyclotetradecane), [16]aneS(4) (1,5,9,13-tetrathiacyclohexadecane), [8]aneSe(2) (1,5-diselenacyclooctane) or [16]aneSe(4) (1,5,9,13-tetraselenacyclohexadecane)] in anhydrous CH2Cl2, MeCN or thf solution to afford colourless to red-orange powdered solids involving a 1:1 Sb:L ratio in most cases, and occasionally a 2:1 Sb:L ratio.

The donor-like effect (an interaction of antisite defects and vacancies), which can be adjusted by varying hot deformation temperature, was also considered responsible for the remarkable enhancement in power factor. Besides, the in-plane lattice thermal conductivity was greatly reduced by in situ nanostructures and high-density lattice defects generated during the hot deformation process. The present study experimentally demonstrates a successful combination of microscale texture enhancement, atomic scale lattice defects and donor-like effect and recrystallization induced nanostructures as a new approach to improve thermoelectric properties. These effects led to a maximum ZT of 0.95 for the Bi2Te2Se1 sample hot deformed at 823 K, about 80% improvement over that without hot deformation.", "ISSN": "0959-9428", "pub": "JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY", "volume": "22", "authors": ["Hu, LP", "Gao, HL", "Liu, XH", "Xie, HH", "Shen, JJ", "Zhu, TJ", "Zhao, XB"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/JM/c2jm32916f", "issue": "32", "pages": "16484-16490"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.1630363", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/jap/95/1/1.1630363.pdf;jsessionid=oa5k1u2kt8cx.x-aip-live-03?itemId=/content/aip/journal/jap/95/1/10.1063/1.1630363&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/jap", "pubDate": "JAN 1 2004", "title": "Effect of annealing on thermoelectric properties of bismuth telluride compounds doped with various additives", "abstract": "The p-type (Bi0.25Sb0.75)(2)Te-3 doped with 8 wt % excess Te and 0.3 wt % Se and the n-type Bi-2(Te0.94Se0.06)(3) doped with 0.08 wt % SbI3, 0.02 wt % Te, and 0.01 wt % CuBr were grown by the Bridgman method at a rate of 6 cm/h. The thermoelectric properties of these specimens were measured before and after annealing, where annealing was done in the temperature range from 473 up to 673 K for 2-5 h in a vacuum and a hydrogen stream. When the p- and n-type specimens were annealed at 673 K for 2 h in a hydrogen stream and a vacuum, respectively, the thermoelectric figures of merit ZT at 298 K for the p- and n-type specimens reached the greatest values of 0.97 and 1.00, respectively. The rate of enhancement in the ZT due to the annealing, however, was only about 3% for both specimens, which is about a tenth of those of our previous specimens doped with different types of dopants. Combining with our previous results of bismuth telluride compounds, it was found that there is a strong correlation between the rate of enhancement in the ZT due to the annealing and the electrical resistivity rho of the as-grown specimen, and that the rate of enhancement reaches a maximum when the as-grown bismuth telluride ingots have a rho value of about 12 muOmega m, at least in the present fabrication method.

Extrusion ratio has significant influence on the degree of deformation. Extrusion angle also shows effect on the deformation, low extrusion angle die has longer or larger regions of deformation, which means lower deformation rate and will cause less micro-pores. Then n-type Bi2Te3 based materials were also hot extruded under different experiment conditions, and effect of extrusion parameters on microstructure and thermoelectric properties of the materials was studied, and a (00l) preferred orientation microstructure was formed in the hot extruded samples. With increasing the extrusion ratio, the Lotgering orientation factor of the extruded sample increases, and the power factor also shows a magnificent increase.

Chiral monochlorotitanates are readily prepared from CpTiCl3 or Cp*TiCl3 and chiral 1,4-diols, which in turn are obtained from tartrate ester acetals by Grignard addition. The resulting stable seven-membered titanacycles have been analyzed by H-1, C-13, and Ti-49 NMR spectroscopy.

The ally] reagents are obtained from the chlorides by transmetalation with allyllithium, allylpotassium, or allyl Grignard compounds. For the ensuing reactions with aldehydes these reagents do not have to be isolated or purified. Correlation of X-ray data and Ti NMR line widths with selectivity suggests that asymmetric distortion of the titanium coordination geometry could be essential for enantioface discrimination, rather than direct interactions of reactants with the chiral ligand. By variation of the ligand substituents, allyltitanates derived from chloride 15 (with 2,2-dimethyl-alpha,alpha,alpha',alpha'-tetraphenyl-1,3-dioxolane-3,4-dimethanol as the ligand) emerged as the most selective reagents.

This process is believed to result in the in situ solid-state introduction of metallic Ti via the reduction of the TiCl3 by the Na-component of NaAlH4 (to form NaCl). Properties studied were hydriding and dehydriding rates and reversible gravimetric H-capacity as a function of starting TiCl3 content. Detailed isothermal kinetic studies were done over a wide temperature range (20-225 degreesC) and treated by Arrhenius analysis. All kinetics were found to follow the Arrhenius equation and the changes of thermal activation energies and rate constants with TiCl3-content were observed that may give valuable insights into the as-yet unknown mechanistic factors that control H-2 desorption and absorption kinetics. Ti increases both dehydriding and hydriding kinetics (and associated practical engineering rates), but at the substantial expense of H-capacity.

The proposed model is constituted by 2 kinds of elementary reactions: the one is that 2LiNH(2) decomposes to Li2NH and ammonia (NH3) the other is that the emitted NH3 reacts with LiH and transforms into LiNH2 and H-2. Since the former and the latter reactions are, respectively, endothermic and exothermic, the HD reaction corresponding to the latter reaction occurs as soon as LiNH2 has decomposed into Li2NH and NH3. Therefore, the HD reaction can be understood by the following processes: at the first step, LiNH2 decomposes into Li2NH/(2) + NH3/2, and then the emitted NH3/2 quickly reacts with LiH/2, transforming into LiNH2/2 + H-2/2; at the second one, the produced LiNH2/2 decomposes to Li2NH/4 + NH3/4, and then NH3/4 + LiH/4 transform to LiNH2/4 + H-2/4, and such successive steps continue until LiNH2 and LiH completely transform into Li2NH and H-2, even at low temperatures, by the catalytic effect of TiCl3.(.)", "ISSN": "1520-6106", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B", "volume": "108", "authors": ["Ichikawa, T", "Hanada, N", "Isobe, S", "Leng, HY", "Fujii, H"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp049968y", "issue": "23", "pages": "7887-7892"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 26 1995", "title": "CARBONYL COUPLING REACTIONS CATALYTIC IN TITANIUM AND THE USE OF COMMERCIAL TITANIUM POWDER FOR ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS", "abstract": "The high thermodynamic stability of titanium oxides formed as the inorganic byproducts in McMurry-type reactions has so far prevented the development of a catalytic procedure for such reductive carbonyl coupling processes. Similarly, a tightly bound oxide layer passivates the surface of commercial titanium, which is unreactive toward organic substrates under conventional conditions. This paper outlines a way to overcome both of these problems. Thus, oxoamides 1a-h can be reductively cyclized to indoles 2a-h using only catalytic amounts of low-valent titanium if the reaction is carried out in the presence of a chlorosilane. Specifically, the method is based upon the in situ generation of an activated titanium species from TiCl3 and Zn in the presence of the substrate, followed by regeneration of titanium chloride from the titanium oxides formed via ligand exchange with the admired chlorosilane. Its proper choice is crucial for obtaining both good turnover numbers and clean conversions. Depending on the product structure, (TMS)Cl, ClMe(2)SiCH(2)CH(2)SiMe(2)Cl (5), or ClMe(2)Si(CH2)(3)CN (6) was found to be best suited. Similarly, chlorosilanes also effect the activation of commercial titanium powder which may then be used as a performant off-the-shelf reagent for various types of carbonyl and acetal coupling reactions, for the deoxygenation of epoxides and for the reductive cyclization of oxoamides or oxoesters to indoles, benzofurans, and 2-quinolones. Under these conditions retinal can be reductively dimerized to beta-carotene in good yield. Moreover, the titanium/ chlorosilane reagent combination exhibits a strong template effect, allowing macrocyclization reactions without recourse to high dilution.

This investigation has sought to identify the extent catalytic dehydrogenation reaction rate of a number of transition metal additions to NaAlH4 at 120degreesC. Two mol% catalysts were added, primarily as chlorides, in a number of valance states. High energy ball mill attrition of the catalyst and the alanate were made with optimum milling times determined. Comparison of dehydrogenation rates with ion radius has shown an optimum catalyst ion radius ratio to be readily identifiable as being midway between that of Al(III) and Na(I).

Two materials were evaluated, one mechanically milled with the liquid alkoxides Ti(OBun)(4) and Zr(OPri)(4) and one milled with dry TiCl, as catalyst precursors.

It was found that the dehydrogenated wet-chemically Ti(OBun)(4) doped NaAlH4 consists of a crystalline Al and an amorphous NaH phase. The striking result of EDX analyses is that in each case the Ti-dopant is found to be present only in the Al phase. On the other hand, dehydrogenated NaAlH4 doped with Ti* or TiCl3 via ball milling is an amorphous material, with diffuse boundaries between Al and NaH phases and a highly uniform distribution of titanium in the Al-phase. Both the use of the ball milling doping method and of Ti* nanoparticles as dopants, are probable reasons for the outstanding kinetics of the Ti* doped material (B. Bogdanovic, M. Felderhoff, S. Kaskel, A. Pommerin, K. Schlichte and F. Schuth, Adv. Mater., 2003, 15, 1012; M. Fichtner, O. Fuhr, O. Kircher and J. Rothe, Nanotechnology, 2003, 14, 778).

Ti-EXAFS and XANES spectra of Ti-doped NaAlH4 after the doping, after several, and after 100 de- and rehydrogenation cycles are very close to each other. Apparently, after the Ti-doping, a zerovalent Ti species is formed which remains almost unchanged in the course of the cycle test.

The synthesized materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), N-2 sorption isotherms and the reaction of catalytic oxidation of styrene. When the pH value of the gel solution was approximately 1.8 and titanium chloride was added after prehydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate for a certain time, the titanium could be effectively incorporated into the framework of SBA-15. The Ti-SBA-15 so obtained was of high quality. With the present synthesis approach, the formation of anatase TiO2 in Ti-SBA-15 can be avoided. Moreover, the addition of H2O2 during the preparation process can improve the quality of Ti-SBA-15.

A priori, this material has one of the highest theoretical gravimetric hydrogen contents, 18.5 wt%, but unfortunately for practical applications, hydrogen release occurs at too high temperature in a non-reversible way. By means of in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), the interaction between LiBH4 and different additives-SiO2, TiCl3, LiCl, and Au - is investigated. It is found that silicon dioxide reacts with molten LiBH4 and forms Li2SiO3 or Li4SiO4 at relatively low amounts of SiO2, e.g., with 5.0 and 9.9 mol % SiO2 in LiBH4, Whereas, for higher amounts of SiO2 (e.g., 25.5 mol %), only the Li2SiO3 phase is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a solid-state reaction occurs between LiBH4 and TiCl3 to form LiCl at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, more LiCl is formed simultaneously with a decrease in the diffracted intensity from TiCl3. Lithium chloride shows some solubility in solid LiBH4 at T > 100 degrees C. This is the first report of substituents that accommodate the structure of LiBH4 by a solid/solid dissolution reaction.

Exceptional compounds are known, however, which display the \"inert pair effect\": they contain a lone pair of electrons that appear spherically symmetrical and are thus stereochemically inactive. We consider BiI63-, BiCl63- BiI3, and SbI3 as prototypical molecules and solids containing six-coordinate, group 15 atoms with stereochemically active or inactive lone pair electrons on the central atom. Extended Huckel molecular orbital and crystal orbital calculations show an underlying tendency for a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion from octahedral to trigonal coordination of the central atom. The distortion mixes the central atom p(z) character of the unoccupied orbitals with the s character of the HOMO and thus hybridizes the lone pair electrons toward the longer M-X bonds (M = Bi or Sb; X = I or Cl). For the MX3 compounds, the hybrid lone pair points toward the smaller X-M-X angles, and the basic assumption of the VSEPR model is confounded for extended solids. Whether or not the distortion is structurally realized for the BiI63- and BiCl63- molecules depends upon the balance between HOMO-LUMO mixing and (1) the mixing between the HOMO and a lower energy 1a1 orbital with ligand lone pair and Bi p(z) character and (2) repulsions among ligand lone pairs. The HOMO-1a1 mixing is strongest and ligand lone pair-lone pair repulsions are greatest for large, electropositive ligands. HOMO-LUMO mixing predominates for the compounds that display trigonal distortions (BiCl63- and SbI3), but not for those that remain octahedral (BiI63- and BiI3).", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "114", "authors": ["WHEELER, RA", "KUMAR, PNVP"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00038a049", "issue": "12", "pages": "4776-4784"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-2313(88)90045-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022231388900452/pdf?md5=1792082786256753ccb86134109ac74e&pid=1-s2.0-0022231388900452-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 1988", "title": "EXCITONS IN LAYERED BII3 SINGLE-CRYSTALS", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-2313", "pub": "JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE", "volume": "42", "authors": ["KAIFU, Y"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022231388900452", "issue": "2", "pages": "61-81"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja108278j", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 26 2011", "title": "Structural Diversity and Thermochromic Properties of Iodobismuthate Materials Containing d-Metal Coordination Cations: Observation of a High Symmetry [Bi3I11](2-) Anion and of Isolated I- Anions", "abstract": "Six new inorganic-organic salts, all containing iodobismuthate anions and d-metal coordination cations, were synthesized solvothermally from reactions of bismuth iodide, a transition metal (M) nitrate salt (M = Co, Fe or Zn), and a heterocyclic, chelating organic ligand: 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-phen), 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (TMphen), or 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine (tpy).

Pump-and-probe absorption and resonant luminescence spectra of the exciton states were measured with an intense nanosecond laser not only at the exciting laser spot but at distant points from the exciting spot by applying space-resolved spectroscopy methods. The blueshift proportional to the exciton density was clearly observed on the probe absorption spectra even at the distant points due to high-density excitons flowing out from the exciting spot. The resonant luminescence also shows the spectral change and anomalous spatial expansion depending on the excitation density. The spatial distributions of the energy shift on the probe absorption and the luminescence intensity were analyzed on the basis of a two-dimensional exciton-flow model with dissipation processes. The analysis suggests the existence of an efficient in-phase motion of the exciton polaritons at high density. The results are discussed in terms of a new phase of the interacting high-density exciton-polariton system.

It is highly expressed in sensory neurons, including small nociceptive neurons and has been proposed to participate in pain perception associated with tissue acidosis and in mechanoperception. Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and FMRFamide have been shown to potentiate proton-gated currents from cultured sensory neurons and acid sensing ion channel (ASIC) cDNA transfected cells. In this study, we report that another mammalian peptide neuropeptide SF (NPSF), derived from the same precursor, also considerably increases the amplitude of the sustained current of heterologously expressed ASIC3 (12-fold vs. 19- and nine-fold for FMRFamide and NPFF, respectively) with an EC50 of similar to50 muM. Similar effects were also observed on endogenous ASI3-like sustained current recorded from DRG neurons although of smaller amplitudes (two-, three- and seven-fold increase for NPSF, NPFF and FMRFamide, respectively), and essentially related to a slowing down of the inactivation rate. Importantly, this modulation induced changes in neuronal excitability in response to an electrical stimulus applied during extracellular acidification. ASIC3-mediated sustained depolarisation, and its regulation by neuropeptides, could thus be important in regulating polymodal neuron excitability particularly under inflammatory conditions where the expression levels of both NPFF precursor and ASIC3 are increased.

In response to extracellular amino acids this sensor initiates metabolic signals that ultimately regulate the functional expression of several amino acid-metabolizing enzymes and amino acid permeases (AAPs). hs a result of diminished leucine uptake capabilities, ssy1 Delta leu2 and ptr3 Delta leu2 mutant strains are unable to grow on synthetic complete medium (SC). Genes affecting the functional expression of AAPs were identified by selecting spontaneous suppressing mutations in amino acid sensor-independent (ASI) genes that restore growth on SC. The suppressors define 11 recessive (asi) complementation groups and 5 dominant (ASI) linkage groups. Strains with mutations in genes assigned to these 16 groups fall into two phenotypic classes. Mutations in the class I genes (ASI1, ASI2, ASI3, TUP1, SSN6, ASI13) derepress the transcription of AAP genes. ASI1, ASI2, and ASI3 encode novel membrane proteins, and Asi1p and Asi3p are homologous proteins that have conserved ubiquitin ligase-like RING domains at their extreme C termini. Several of the class II genes (DOA4, UBA1, BRO1, BUL1, RSP5, VPS20, VPS36) encode proteins implicated in controlling aspects of post-Golgi endosomal-vacuolar protein sorting.

In response to extracellular amino acids, the plasma membrane SPS sensor endoproteolytically excises the N-terminal domains that mediate cytoplasmic retention, enabling the processed forms to efficiently enter the nucleus and induce gene expression. Cytoplasmic retention is not absolute, low levels of full-length Stp1 and Stp2 \"leak\" into the nucleus, and the concerted action of inner nuclear membrane proteins Asi1, Asi2, and Asi3 restricts their promoter access. In cells lacking Asi function, the precursor forms bind promoters and constitutively induce gene expression. To understand the requirement of Asi-dependent repression, spontaneous mutations in Required for Latent Stp1/2-mediated transcription (RLS) genes that abolish the constitutive expression of SPS sensor-regulated genes in an asi1 Delta strain were selected. A single gene, allelic with DAL81, was identified.

Both compounds were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, the first also by its X-ray structure.

We demonstrate that compression in this class of material leads to complex compression mechanisms favouring more isotropically bonded phases, to gradual breakdown of low-frequency rigid unit vibrations and to unusual electron charge transfer effects which are reflected in non-monotonic variations of vibrational frequencies with pressure.", "ISSN": "0370-1972", "pub": "PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC RESEARCH", "volume": "211", "authors": ["Hsueh, HC", "Crain, J"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1521-3951(199901)211:1%3C365::AID-PSSB365%3E3.0.CO;2-O/abstract;jsessionid=6B161AE7DE2F0874464F1820D9ACEE12.f03t02", "issue": "1", "pages": "365-371"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0022-3093(96)00375-4", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309396003754/pdf?md5=4f2170219f0245fcdb1b92ded1a8bf55&pid=1-s2.0-S0022309396003754-main.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 1996", "title": "Short-range order of amorphous and liquid As-Te-I system", "abstract": "Raman scattering and X-ray diffraction measurements have been carried out on the amorphous As50-xTe50Ix system with x = 0-25.

GaAs was found to be etched continuously at rates between 0.05 and 1.70-mu-m min-1 under these conditions.  Although the etch rate appears to be first order with respect to I2 at pressures below 0.3 Torr, the order decreased at higher pressures.  The data was analyzed in terms of two mechanisms, which have been proposed for the etching of semiconductors by halogen molecules.  These are the \"reversible dissociative adsorption\" (RDA) mechanism, and the \"surface site saturation\" (SSS) mechanism.  In the RDA mechanism the dissociative adsorption, which explains the nonlinear pressure dependence, occurs irreversibly at low pressure giving rise to first order kinetics with a first order rate constant (k1) which can be expressed in the following Arrhenius form:  k1 = 10(4.7 +/- 0.2) mu-min-1 Torr-1 exp[ - (55 +/- 2) kJ mol - 1/RT].  At higher pressures, the dependence on I2 changes to half order and the composite half order rate constant (k1/2) can be represented by the equation:  k1/2 = 10(6.5 +/- 0.9) mu-m-min-1 Torr-1/2 exp[ - (69 +/- 10) kJ mol-1/RT].  On the other hand, the SSS mechanism involves the reversible physisorption of I2 on the GaAs surface (governed by an equilibrium constant K) followed by a rate controlling reaction of this physisorbed species leads to products (governed by the rate constant k4).  The values obtained for these two constants are:  K = 10(-4.8 +/- 0.7) Torr-1 exp[ +  ( 49 +/- 7) kJ mol-1/RT], and k4 = 10(9.2 +/- 0.4) mu-m-min-1 exp[ - (96 +/- 5) kJ mol-1/RT].

The A(1) mode energy for these units depends little on the I concentration, suggesting that mixed-anion units, which have been observed in amorphous Ge-X-I systems, are not formed in the present As chalcohalide systems. Values for the structural parameters of these units, determined from a least-square analysis of the X-ray intensity function, have indicated that all of the I atoms added contribute to the formation of AsI3 units and that the excess X atoms participate in the formation of AsX(3/2) connecting units, particularly at higher x, i.e., the breakdown of AsX(3/2) units bridged by corner-shared X atoms is promoted with increasing I content.

Stp1, the effector transcription factor, is synthesized as a latent cytoplasmic precursor with an N-terminal regulatory domain that restricts its nuclear accumulation. The negative regulatory mechanisms impinging on the N-terminal domain are poorly understood. However, Stp1 latency depends on three inner nuclear membrane proteins, Asi1, Asi2, and Asi3. We report that the N-terminal domain of Stp1 contains a small motif, designated RI, that fully accounts for latency. RI is modular, mediates interactions with the plasma membrane, and can retain histone Htb2 in the cytoplasm. A novel class of STP1 mutations affecting RI were isolated that are less efficiently retained in the cytoplasm but remain under tight negative control by the Asi proteins. Intriguingly, these mutant proteins exhibit enhanced stability in strains lacking ASI1. Our results indicate that RI mediates latency by two distinct activities: it functions as a cytoplasmic retention determinant and an Asi-dependent degron. These findings provide novel insights into the SPS-sensing pathway and demonstrate for the first time that the inner nuclear membrane Asi proteins function in a degradation pathway in the nucleus.", "ISSN": "1059-1524", "pub": "MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL", "volume": "25", "authors": ["Omnus, DJ", "Ljungdahl, PO"], "DOIlink": "http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/25/23/3823", "issue": "23", "pages": "3823-3833"}, {"DOI": "10.1134/S1087659610050032", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134%2FS1087659610050032.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 2010", "title": "Electrical Conductivity of CuI-AsI3-As2Se3 and CuI-SbI3-As2Se3 Chalcogenide Films Prepared by Chemical Deposition", "abstract": "The electrical conductivity of chalcogenide semiconductor films in the CuI AsI3 As2Se3 and CuI-SbI3-As2Se3 systems, which have been prepared by chemical deposition from mono-n-butylamine, has been studied as a function of the temperature and film composition.

In direct ATRP, iron(II) bromide complexed with ammonium and phosphonium chloride, bromide, or iodide salts has been shown to catalyze the polymerization of both styrene and (meth)acrylates in a controlled manner under appropriate conditions. The experimental molecular weights increased linearly with monomer conversion and were close to the calculated values. The polymerization rates and polydispersities (M-w/M-n = 1.1-1.4) were dependent on the monomer employed. Reverse ATRP, initiated by AIBN/FeBr3/onium salts, led to a controlled polymerization of both methyl methacrylate and methyl acrylate, while for styrene uncontrolled molecular weights and high polydispersities were obtained, presumably due to the involvement of the cationic polymerization.

Our interest in amidate coordination prompted an investigation of the iron complexes of the potentially tetradentate ligand N-(bis(2-pyridyl)methyl)pyridine-2-carboxamide (H-L). A number of complexes have been isolated and structurally characterized, including [Fe-4(III)(L)(2)] (1), [Fe-III(L-OCH3)Br-2(CH3OH)] (3), [Fe-2(III) (mu-OH)(2)(L-OCH3)(2)Br-2](4), and [Fe-4(III) (mu-OCH3)(2)(L-O)(2)Br-6] (5). In these complexes L acts as a meridional tridentate ligand, as previously observed for the corresponding [Cu(L)Cl(CH3OH)] complex (Inorg. Chem. 39 (2000) 5326). In the cases of 3 and 4, the hydrogen of the tertiary carbon has been replaced by a methoxy group in the course of complex synthesis. In the case of 5, the tertiary hydrogen is replaced by hydroxide, and this oxygen and the dangling pyridine act as a bidentate ligand to a second iron ion. When the reaction of FeBr3 and H-L was carried out in acetonitrile in the presence of base but in the absence of air, the ligand was cleaved into two pieces, affording [(FeBr2)-Br-II(pyridine-2-carboxamide)(di-2-pyridylketone)] (6). It is proposed that the coordination of the amide nitrogen of H-L to an iron(III) center as an amidate activates the alpha-C-H bond and results in the oxidation of the alpha-C-N-amide bond to an imine.

The magnetic susceptibility over a range of temperature is that expected for an intramolecular antiferromagnet.  Both the cation and anion resonances in the Mossbauer spectrum are consistent with the structure as is the infrared spectrum.

Five iron halides were used as the catalysts, it was found that the oxidation activity and the DMHB yield decreased in the order FeCl2 > FeBr3 > FeCl3 much greater than FeF2 > FeI2. The solvent had significant effect on the FeCl2 catalyst performances, but the solvent effect was opposite to that observed earlier for a CuCl2 catalyst. Among alcohols with 1-6 carbon numbers, methanol was the best solvent for FeCl2, but it was reported earlier to be the worst solvent for CuCl2. In the temperature range of 70-110degreesC, the maximum DMHB yield obtained with FeCl2 was around 75% (this yield was higher than that obtained with CuCl2), which occurred at the 2,4,6-TMP conversion of around 93%. Further increase of 2,4,6-TMP conversion resulted in the rapid increase of the by-product (2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, DMBQ), which suggested that most of the DMBQ came from the oxidation of the desired product. An electron transfer (from 2,4,6-TMP to iron (III)) mechanism involving the intermediacy of an aromatic radical cation was proposed for the oxidation of 2,4,6-TMP to DMHB. Based on the mechanism, the effects of solvents and halide ligands were explained. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The polymerizations happened with controlled evidence at appropriate molar ratio of Fe(0) to Br-2: a remarkable increase of molecular weights with St conversions, the narrow molecular weight distributions and living polymer chains end-capped by Br. More Br-2 or less Fe(0) led to a slow polymerization rate but an improved control over molecular weights. After examining the polymer chain ends by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was concluded that the polymerization was initiated by thermal self-initiation, and regulated by the in situ generated (FeBr3)-Br-III. The results suggested that the Fe(0)/Br-2 catalyzing polymerization was a classical ATRP process with easier operation and more economical components. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
