Synthesis rates for hexanols (ROH), hexanal/hexanones (R(-H)=O), and acids were proportional to hexylhydroperoxide (ROOH) concentrations on all Mn-zeolite catalysts, except Mn-ZSM-58, on which products formed exclusively via noncatalytic autoxidation because of restricted access to Mn cations present within small channels (0.36 nm). Catalytic decomposition of ROOH intermediates occurs on intrachannel Mn cations and is the kinetically relevant step in alkane oxidation. ROOH decomposition rate constants were 2.5,1.4, and 0.41 mol (mol-Mn h)(-1) (mM-ROOH)(-1) on Mn-ZSM-5, Mn-ZSM-57, and Mn-MOR (403 K; 0.4 MPa O-2), respectively. Regioselectivity was influenced by the constrained environment around Mn cations, which increased terminal selectivities above the values predicted from the relative bond energies of methyl and methylene C-H bonds in n-hexane. Mn cations within 10-ring channels gave higher terminal selectivities (Mn-ZSM-5: 24%, k(pri)m/k(sec) = 0.42; Mn-ZSM-57: 14%, k(prim)/k(sec) = 0.22) than those within 8-membered or 12-membered rings (Mn-MOR, Mn-ZSM-57: 8-10%, k(pim)/k(sec) = 0.12-0.14), because of restricted access in ZSM-58 and unconstrained transition states for C-H bond activation in MOR. Terminal selectivities decreased with increasing alkane conversion, because unselective noncatalytic autoxidation pathways prevail as ROOH concentrations concurrently increase. ROOH intermediates can be scavenged from the extracrystalline liquid phase using H-zeolites with accessible protons, which inhibit unselective noncatalytic reactions and maintain higher terminal selectivities as conversion increases, albeit with a concomitant decrease in the rate of oxidation steps also involving ROOH intermediates.

In this model obtained, for all 186 complex halides systems, only one system (CsF-MnF(2)) without perovskite structure and six systems (RbF-PbF(2), CsF-BeF(2), KCl-FeCl(2), TlI-MnI(2), RbI-SnI(2), TlI-PbI(2)) with perovskite structure were wrongly classified, so its predicting accuracy reaches 96%. It is also indicated that both the tolerance factor and the octahedral factor are a necessary but not sufficient condition for ABX(3) halide perovskite formability, and a lowest limit of the octahedral factor exists for halide perovskite formation. This result is consistent with our previous report for ABO(3) oxide perovskite, and may be helpful to design novel halide materials with the perovskite structure.", "ISSN": "0108-7681", "pub": "ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION B-STRUCTURAL SCIENCE", "volume": "64", "authors": ["Li, CH", "Lu, XG", "Ding, WZ", "Feng, LM", "Gao, YH", "Guo, ZG"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "702-707"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0378-4363(83)90128-6", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378436383901286/pdf?md5=0ac500663e9f3df0532a15209cbc66e4&pid=1-s2.0-0378436383901286-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1983", "title": "OPTICAL-ABSORPTION AND MAGNETIC CIRCULAR-DICHROISM OF MNI2\n", "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-4363(83)90128-6", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0378-4371", "pub": "PHYSICA B & C", "volume": "121", "authors": ["HOEKSTRA, HJWM", "BOUDEWIJN, PR", "GROENIER, H", "HAAS, C"], "issue": "1-2", "pages": "62-80"}, {"DOI": "10.1002/ejic.200300832", "pdflink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1099-0682c/homepage/2005_media.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL 5 2004", "title": "Synthesis and structural characterization of monomeric manganese(II) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes [MnX2(C{N(iPr)C(Me)}(2))(2)] (X = Cl, I, and MeCOO)", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejic.200300832/abstract;jsessionid=732AD75B96CE3B62BE5F408963265B0E.f04t02", "abstract": "Reaction of MnCl2(THF)(1.5), MnI2, or Mn(MeCOO)(2) with two equivalents of N-heterocyclic carbene [C(Me)N(iPr)](2)C (1) in THE at room temperature readily afforded the corresponding carbene adducts [MnX2(C{N(iPr)C(Me)}(2))(2)] [X = Cl (2); X = I (3); X = MeCOO (4)] in good yield.

X-ray analysis revealed that the complexes 1 and 3 adopt a distorted octahedral structure in which the two phenoxy oxygens are situated in the traps-position while the two imine nitrogens and the two chlorine atoms are located cis to one another, the same spatial disposition as that for the corresponding nonfluorinated complex. Although the Ti-O, Ti-N, and Ti-Cl bond distances for complexes 1 and 3 are very similar to those for the nonfluorinated complex, the bond angles between the ligands (e.g., O-Ti-O, N-Ti-N, and Cl-Ti-CI) and the Ti-N-C-C torsion angles involving the phenyl on the imine nitrogen are different from those for the nonfluorinated complex, as a result of the introduction of fluorine atoms. Complex 1/methylalumoxane (MAO) catalyst system promoted living ethylene polymerization to produce high molecular weight polyethylenes (M-n > 400 000) with extremely narrow polydispersities (M-w/M-n < 1.20). Very high activities (TOF > 20 000 min(-1) atm(-1)) were observed chat are comparable to those of Cp2ZrCl2/MAO at high polymerization temperatures (25, 50 C). Complexes 2-4, which have a fluorine atom adjacent to the imine nitrogen, behaved as living ethylene polymerization catalysts at 50 degreesC, whereas complexes 5-7, possessing no fluorine adjacent to the imine nitrogen, produced polyethylenes having M-w/M-n values of ca. 2 with beta-hydrogen transfer as the main termination pathway. These results together with DFT calculations suggested that the presence of a fluorine atom adjacent to the imine nitrogen is a requirement for the high-temperature living polymerization, and the fluorine of the active species for ethylene polymerization interacts with a beta-hydrogen of a polymer chain, resulting in the prevention of beta-hydrogen transfer.

Using these methodologies, a range of binaphthoxide and biphenoxide catalysts with varying steric hindrance have been prepared: {1,1'-(2,2',3,3'-OC(10)H(5)SiR(3))}2ZrCl2 {R(3) = Me(3) (1); R(3) = MePh(2) (2); R(3) = Ph(3) (3)}, {1,1'-(2,2',3,3'-OC(10)H(5)SiMe(3))}Ti-2(CH(2)Ph)(2) (4), {1,1'-(2,2',3,3'-OC(10)H(5)SiMePh(2))}Zr-2(CH(2)Ph)(2) (5), (1,1'-(2,2',3,3'-OC(10)H(5)SiPh(3))}Ti-2(CH(2)Ph)(2) {M = Ti (7), M = Zr (8)}, 2,2'-S(4-Me,6-(i)BuC(6)H(2)O)(2)MX(2) {MX(2) = TiCl2 (10); MX(2) = ZrCl2 (11); MX(2) = Ti(CH(2)Ph)(2) (12)}, {2,2'-S(4-Me,6-(t)BuC(6)H(2)O)(2)}Ti-2 (13), 2,2'-(4,6-(t)Bu(2)C(6)H(2)O)(2)MX(2) {MX(2) = Ti(CH(2)Ph)(2) (14); MX(2) = ZrCl2(THF)(2) (15)}, {2,2'-(4-OMe,6-(t)BuC(6)H(2)O)(2)}Ti-2 (16), 2,2'-(4-OMe,6-(t)BuC(6)H(2)O)(2)Ti(CH(2)Ph)(2) (17)}, 2,2'-CH2(4-Et,6-(t)BuC(6)H(2)O)(2)TiX(2) {X = CH(2)Ph (18), X = Cl (19), and {2,2'-CH2(4-Et,6-(t)BuC(6)H(2)O)(2)}Ti-2 (20). This class of L(2)MCl(2) systems can be regarded as being analogous to the well-documented range of Group IV metallocenes. Alkylation of (O-O)ZrCl2 ((O-O = chelating phenoxide) allowed access to other alkyl species. Therefore, reaction of 3 with MeLi or Me(3)SiCH(2)Li afforded {1,1'-{2,2',3,3'-OC(10)H(5)SiPh(3)}(2)ZrX(2) {X = Me (6); X = CH(2)SiMe(3) (9)}, respectively.

Attempts to prepare analogous sterically hindered binaphthiolates were thwarted by the absence of known sterically hindered chelating binaphthiols. Synthetic routes to such ligands were attempted albeit without success. The chelating phenoxide and binaphthoxide titanium and zirconium species, in the presence of an aluminum cocatalyst are active for the oligo-polymerization of alpha-olefins. For the polymerization of ethylene, rates of up to 4740 kg of PE/mol of catalyst . h (100 kg/g of Ti . h) were obtained. They are active for the polymerization of butadiene and the catalytic cyclotrimerization of terminal acetylenes to 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzenes. This ratio of benzenes is dependent on the steric bulk of the ancillary binaphthol ligands.\n\nSteric modifications also have a clear influence on the degree of 1-hexene polymerization as well as the tacticity of poly(1-hexene). In particular, the chelating alkoxide ligand framework can induce stereoregularity. For 1 and 2, with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst, regioregular and stereospecific polymerization of 1-hexene is observed to give high molecular weight isotactic polyhexene. Related ligand-dependent differences in polymer microstructure are observed in the polymerization of butadiene. Cationic complexes have been synthesized.

The catalysts exhibited very high norbornene incorporation, superior to that obtained with Me2Si(Me4CP)(N-tert-Bu)TiCl2 (CGC). The sterically open and highly electrophilic nature of the catalysts is probably responsible for the excellent norbornene incorporation. The catalysts displayed a marked tendency to produce alternating copolymers, which have stereoirregular structures despite the C-2 symmetric nature of the catalysts. The norbomene/ethylene molar ratio in the polymerization medium had a profound influence on the molecular weight distribution of the resulting copolymer. At norbomene/ethylene ratios larger than ca. 1, the catalysts mediated room-temperature living copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene to form high molecular weight monodisperse copolymers (M-n > 500 000, M-w/M-n < 1.20).C-13 NMR spectroscopic analysis of a copolymer, produced under conditions that gave low molecular weight, demonstrated that the copolymerization is initiated by norbornene insertion and that the catalyst mostly exists as a norbornene-last-inserted species under living conditions. Polymerization behavior coupled with DFT calculations suggested that the highly controlled living polymerization stems from the fact that the catalysts possess high affinity and high incorporation ability for norbornene as well as the characteristics of a living ethylene polymerization though under limited conditions (M-n 225 000, M-w/M-n 1.15, 10-s polymerization, 25degreesC).

The inferior corrosion behavior of STA Ti-15-3-3, with beta + alpha microstructure, in comparision to ST Ti-15-3-3, with a single phase beta solid solution microstructure, was attributed in part to beta and alpha stabilizer partitioning during the metastable beta (body-centered cubic [bcc]) --> beta + alpha phase transformation, which resulted in an Al-rich alpha phase and a Mo- and Nb-rich beta phase in the aged microstructure. This was confirmed by anodic polarization experiments of Ti-Al binary alloys, as well as by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) nanostructural analysis of corroded STA alloy surfaces, Isothermal aging of Ti-13-13 resulted in the partial phase transformation from metastable beta and diffusionless alpha' (martensitic hexagonal close-packed [hcp]) to a beta + alpha' + alpha microstructure. The slight partitioning of Nb into the beta phase, the presence of significant concentrations of Zr in the beta and or phases, and lack of Al accounted for the improved passivity and corrosion resistance of STA Ti-13-13 compared to STA Ti-15-3-3.", "ISSN": "0010-9312", "pub": "CORROSION", "volume": "53", "authors": ["Yu, SY", "Scully, JR"], "issue": "12", "pages": "965-976"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/om950671j", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861392520/orgnd7-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 6 1996", "title": "Bis(triisopropylsilyl)-o-phenylenediamido complexes of titanium and zirconium: Investigation of a new ancillary ligand", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/om950671j", "abstract": "From the dilithio reagent o-C6H4((NLiSiPr3)-Pr-i)(2) (2), the new complexes [o-C6H4((NSiPr3)-Pr-i)(2)]Zr-2 (3), [o-C6H4(Nsi(i)Pr(3))(2)]Zr(O(t)Bu)(2) (4), [o-C6H((NSiPr3)-Pr-i)(2)]TiCl2 (5), and [o-C6H4((NSiPr3)-Pr-i)(2)]TiMe(2) (6) have been prepared.

This method utilizes the observed peak areas of the C-13 signals and takes into account the consistency between peak areas and the stoichiometry of the copolymer chain. Thus, a further extension of signal assignments is made possible by guessing assignments of unknown signals and by discarding inconsistent hypotheses.

In line with recent experimental observations (Maschmeyer, T.; Rey, F.; Sankar, G.; Thomas, J. M.

The styrene incorporation efficiency did not strongly depend upon the cyclopentadienyl fragment used, and this is somewhat different from those obtained by the linked cyclopentadienyl-amide titanium catalyst [Me2Si(C5Me4)(NR)]TiCl2 [R = tert-Bu (6), cyclohexyl (7)]. The resultant copolymers possessed unimodal comonomer distributions (single composition) confirmed by both cross-fractionation chromatography (CFC) and GPC/FT-IR.

Sample materials were produced using approaches based on direct-synthesis and dry Ti-doping methods. It is desirable to introduce Ti through non-reactive processes to avoid the hydrogen capacity loss that occurs through the formation of inactive byproducts (for example Na-halide from the decomposition of Ti-halides and Na-oxides from the decomposition of Ti-alkoxides). We show, for the first time, that alanates can be Ti-doped using TiH2 or through indirect-doping by pre-reacting TiCl2 with LiH. Both methods result in enhanced kinetics. However, improved rates were achieved only after a prolonged activation period of about a 10 cycles, suggesting that cycling leads to Ti diffusion and substitution into the alanate lattice which provides the mechanism through which Ti-doping enhances kinetics. Thus, the reactive decomposition of Ti-halide and alkoxide precursors in the doping process serves an important but not necessarily required function.

The findings obtained by catalyst 1 suggest that the structure of the active species with the bulkier fluorenyl substituent and the following alternating site migratory insertion of comonomer in the chain propagation is responsible for the preferentially alternating, isotactic comonomer incorporation.", "ISSN": "0024-9297", "pub": "MACROMOLECULES", "volume": "31", "authors": ["Xu, GX"], "issue": "8", "pages": "2395-2402"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ol0343459", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233863717051/orlef7-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 15 2003", "title": "Titanium-catalyzed stereoselective geminal heterodihalogenation of beta-ketoesters", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol0343459", "abstract": "beta-Ketoesters can be effectively monofluorinated with F-TEDA using CpTiCl3 as a catalyst.

Chemical inertness is the main weakness of this material when placed in contact with biological systems and surface modification is a possible solution of this problem. The aim of this study is to develop a flexible and facile method for surface modification of TiO(2) nanotubes to tailor new interfacial properties important in many biomedical applications. TiO(2) nanotubes were prepared by electrochemical anodization of titanium foil using ethylene glycol: NH(4)F electrolyte (2% water and 0.3% NH(4)F). Plasma surface modification using allylamine (AA) as a precursor has been applied to generate a thin and chemically reactive polymer (AAPP) film rich in amine groups on top of the TiCl(2) nanotube surface. This initial polymer film was used for further surface functionalization by attachment of desired molecules. Two modification techniques were used to demonstrate the flexibility for building of new functionalities on titania nanotube surface: electrostatic adsorption of poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as an example of layer-by-layer assembly (LbL), and covalent coupling of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as an example of creating a protein-resistant surface. These approaches for tailoring the surface chemistry and wettability of TiO(2) nanotubes offer considerable prospects for advancing their interfacial properties to improve existing and develop new functional biomaterials for diverse biomedical applications.

A number of alkyl aromatics were oxidized directly to their acids, including p-xylene, o-xylene, m-xylene, ethylbenzene, and toluene. Alternatively, conditions were discovered which allowed the oxidation reactions to stop at the aldehyde stage. In addition, several aromatic methylenes could be oxidized to ketones, and anthracene could be oxidized to anthraquinone under the same conditions.

The nozzle temperatures ranged between 960 and 1100 K in the electron diffraction experiments, paralleled with mass spectrometric control of the vapor composition.  Four approximations have been examined for the molecular Hamiltonian in the joint analysis.  The overall utility of combined analysis has been demonstrated.  The dynamic behavior of the first-row transition metal dihalides is best described by the semirigid model.  The equilibrium bond distance is best approximated by the cubic anharmonic potential.  The cubic force constants and the bond Morse anharmonicity parameter can be determined even from electron diffraction data alone provided that experimental information is collected to large enough scattering angles.  The present analysis has confirmed the linearity of equilibrium configuration for all dihalides studied.  The thermal average and equilibrium bond distances obtained are as follows, r(g) (r(e)) with estimated total errors not exceeding +/- 0.007 angstrom, MnCl2 2.202 (2.184), FeCl2 2.151 (2.128), CoCl2 2.113 (2.090), NiCl2 2.076 (2.056), MnBr2 2.344 (2.328), FeBr2 2.294 (2.272), CoBr2 2.241 (2.223), and NiBr2 2.201 (2.177) angstrom.  Appreciable amounts of dimeric species, with four-membered ring structures, were detected in the vapors of FeCl2, CoCl2, and FeBr2 under the electron diffraction experimental conditions.  The largest amount, 11%, occurred for iron dibromide and a reliable geometry was determined for the Fe2Br4 molecule.  The bridging metal-halogen bonds are about 0.2 angstrom longer than the terminal bonds, and the monomer bonds, in all three systems.

Single-crystal Xray studies revealed that in all four complexes, the Mn(II) coordination spheres are distorted octahedral. In 1 and 2, the ether oxygen atom does not coordinate to the Mn(II) centre, but in 3 and 4 it does. The mononuclear molecules of I are linked by double hydrogen bonds to form linear chains. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the Mn(II) ions in 1 interact antiferromagnetically, with J = -1.06 cm(-1). Compound 2 crystallizes as a double chloride-bridged dimer in which there is a weak ferromagnetic interaction (J = 0.55 cm(-1)) between the Mn(II) pair. The solution EPR spectrum of 2 suggests that in methanol compound 2 decomposes to a great extent to mononuclear species. In compound 3, mebpa acts as a tetradentate ligand with all of its nitrogen and oxygen atoms coordinated to the Mn(II) ion. Unexpectedly, in complex 4, the phenolic oxygen of Hmepap remains protonated and does not coordinate to the metal ion. Instead the oxygen from a methanol molecule coordinates the manganese centre. Hydrogen bonds between one of the two bromide ions, and the methanol and phenol hydroxyl groups, respectively, connect the mononuclear molecules of 4 into chains.

We used a 440 mL Hastelloy batch reactor for all experiments and monitored O-2 consumption and product (including CID,) formation. Increasing the catalyst concentration at 300 degrees C significantly increased terephthalic acid yields. MnBr2 was the most active catalyst of those we assessed. Increasing the initial O-2 concentration beyond a modest excess did not significantly alter the terephthalic acid yield, but it increased the CO2 yield. Injecting supplemental O-2 midreaction, however, did cause the terephthalic acid yield to increase.

Terephthalic acid yields of > 90 mol% can be achieved from reactions at 400 degrees C. Using water as the reaction medium provides genuine opportunities for both a more economical and more environmentally benign terephthalic acid production process.

Moreover, regarding each chelating ligand portion as a component which occupies one coordination site of the metal atom, a pseudo-tetrahedral metal coordination is identified.

The concentration of solute within the droplet is controlled accurately by decreasing the relative humidity (RH) of the surroundings. According to the Raman spectra of MnSO4 droplets, when the RH decreased from 94% to 76%, the full width of the peak at half-maximum (fwhm) of the nu(1)-SO42- band at 983 cm(-1) initially increased from 95.7 to 104.2 cm(-1). Two shoulders at similar to 993 and similar to 1002 cm(-1) occurred in the SO42- band at similar to 76% RH, while the nu(2)-SO42- band at 450 cm(-1) split into two bands at 442 and 462 cm(-1), indicating the formation of monodentate and bidentate contact ion pairs (CIPs) in supersaturated MnSO4 droplets. From component band analysis of the nu(1)-SO42- band, four peaks at 983, 993, 1002, and 1010 cm(-1) were identified and assigned to the free SO42-, monodentate CIPs, bidentate CIPs, and more complex ion aggregates, respectively. Signatures of monodentate and bidentate CIPs reached their maximum values at similar to 76% and 60% RH, respectively. With further decreasing the RH, great abundance of various ion pairs presented in the droplet, corresponding the nu(1)-SO42- band steadily blue-shifted, and the fwhm increased continuously until it went through a plateau at 60% RH. When the RH was between similar to 44% and 13%, the intensity of the signature from four species of ion pairs was almost invariant, corresponding to the formation of an amorphous phase of MnSO4 center dot 2.8H(2)O. Further decreasing the RH below 13% RH, monodentate CIPs changed to bidentate ones. In the meantime, MnSO4.2.8H(2)O was deduced to transform into another amorphous phase with a stoichiometry of MnSO4 center dot 1.7H(2)O.

This amount of water lowers the stability constant values as compared to glacial acetic acid.

This finding implicates the dibromide radical as a key intermediate in this chemistry, and indeed in the cobalt-bromide catalyzed autoxidation of methylarenes for which some form of zerovalent bromine has been identified.

Magnetite nanoparticles display strong ferrimagnetic behavior and are less sensitive to oxidation than magnetic transition metal nanoparticles such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. For in vivo applications, well-defined organic coatings are needed to surround the magnetite nanoparticles and prevent any aggregation. The goal of this research was to develop complexes of magnetite nanoparticles coated with well-defined hydrophilic polymers so that they could be dispersed in aqueous fluids. Focal points have included the following: (1) Investigations of polymer systems that bind irreversibly to magnetite at the physiological pH, (2) the design of block copolymers with anchor and tail blocks to enable dispersion in biological fluids, and (3) investigations of copolymer block lengths to maximize the concentration of bound magnetite. Hydrophilic triblock copolymers with controlled concentrations of pendent carboxylic acid binding groups were designed as steric stabilizers for magnetite nanoparticles. These copolymers were comprised of controlled molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) tail blocks and a central, polyurethane anchor block containing carboxylic acids. Stoichiometric aqueous solutions of FeCl2 and FeCl3 were condensed by reaction with NH4OH to form magnetite nanoparticles, and then a dichloromethane solution of the block copolymer was added to adsorb the copolymer onto the magnetite surfaces. Stable magnetite dispersions were prepared with all of the triblock copolymers. The polymer-nanomagnetite conjugates described in this paper had a maximum saturation magnetization of 34 emu/g.

The mechanisms involved in brain edema formation following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have not been fully elucidated. The authors have found that red blood cell lysis plays an important role in edema development after ICH. In the present study, they sought to determine whether degradation products of hemoglobin cause brain edema.\n\nMethods. Hemoglobin, hemin, bilirubin, or FeCl2 were infused with stereotactic guidance into the right basal ganglia of Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were killed 24 hours later to determine brain water and ion contents. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were applied for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) measurement.

Comparing these data to those for the single electron reduction product, ((i)PrPDl)FeCl, again demonstrated a high-spin ferrous ion, but in this case the S-Fe = 2 metal center is antiferromagnetically coupled to a ligand-centered radical (S-L 1/2), accounting for the experimentally observed S = 3/2 ground state. Continued reduction to ((PrPDI)-Pr-i)FeLn (L = N-2, n = 1,2; CO, n = 2; 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, n = 1) resulted in a doubly reduced bis(imino)pyridine diradical, preserving the ferrous ion. Both the computational and the experimental data for the N,N-(dimethylamino)pyridine compound demonstrate nearly isoenergetic singlet (S-L = 0) and triplet (S-L = 1) forms of the bis(imino)pyridine dianion. In both spin states, the iron is intermediate spin (S-Fe = 1) ferrous. Experimentally, the compound has a spin singlet ground state (S = 0) due to antiferromagnetic coupling of iron and the ligand triplet state. Mixing of the singlet diradical excited state with the triplet ground state of the ligand via spin-orbit coupling results in temperature-independent paramagnetism and accounts for the large dispersion in H-1 NMR chemical shifts observed for the in-plane protons on the chelate.

Microthermometric measurements and Raman microspectrometry on the same inclusions complement the data.\n\nThe brine inclusions have an estimated composition (in wt %): NaCl, 20; KCl, 7; CaCl2, 0.9; MnCl2, 4; FeCl2, 14; ZnCl2, 1; plus (in ppm by weight) Co, 300; Cu, 900; As, 500; Br, 400; Rb, 1,700; Sn, approximately 400; Cs, 2,000; Pb, 3,000. Cation ratios in this brine compared with trace element concentrations in the source granite closely match experimental data on equilibrium metal distribution between chloride-bearing aqueous fluid and silicate melts, confirming that the brine inclusions represent near-pristine samples of magmatic fluid.\n\nLow-salinity vapor inclusions occurring in the same sample are interpreted on the basis of phase equilibria to have coexisted with the magmatic brine at 500-degrees to 600-degrees-C and 500 to 800 bars, prior to some cooling and decompression to trapping conditions of 380-degrees to 450-degrees-C and approximately 300 bars. Compared with the brine inclusions, they contain higher concentrations of CO2 and S (of unknown speciation) and about 1 percent Cu as the most abundant cation detected by PIXE analysis. Concentration ratios of copper to all other first-row transition metals (e.g., Cu/Fe, Cu/Zn, and also Cu/Pb) are more than two orders of magnitude higher in the vapor than in the brine inclusions.\n\nThe fluid inclusion results indicate that partitioning of base and precious metals between magmatic vapor and hypersaline brine may be substantial and highly element specific, probably as a result of contrasting metal complexing in the two fluid phases. Volatile sulfur complexes of copper could explain preferential partitioning of copper (and by inference, of gold) into the magmatic vapor phase, whereas chloride complexing causes most other heavy metals to partition into the coexisting brine. The analytical data emphasize the importance of magmatic vapor and vapor condensate as ore-forming solutions and suggest that brine-vapor separation may be an important mechanism of base and precious metal segregation in high-temperature hydrothermal systems. This possibility has not received much attention so far, but could be a significant factor in the formation of porphyry-style and other magmatic hydrothermal base and precious metal deposits.", "ISSN": "0361-0128", "pub": "ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS", "volume": "87", "authors": ["HEINRICH, CA", "RYAN, CG", "MERNAGH, TP", "EADINGTON, PJ"], "issue": "6", "pages": "1566-1583"}, {"DOI": "10.2113/100.7.1287", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 2005", "title": "100th Anniversary special paper: Vapor transport of metals and the formation of magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits", "DOIlink": "http://www.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.2113%2Fgsecongeo.100.7.1287", "abstract": "In most published hydrothermal ore deposit models, the main agent of metal transport is an aqueous liquid. However, there is increasing evidence front volcanic vapors, geothermal systems (continental and submarine), vapor-rich fluid inclusions, and experimental studies that the vapor phase may be an important and even dominant ore fluid in some hydrothermal systems. This paper reviews the evidence for the transport of metals by vapor (which we define as an aqueous fluid of any composition with a density lower than its critical density), clarifies some of the thermodynamic controls that may make such transport possible, and suggests a model for the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits that involves precipitation of the ores from vapor or a vapor-derived fluid.\n\nAnalyses of vapor (generally > 90% water) released from volcanic fumaroles at temperatures from 500 degrees to over 900 degrees C and near-atmospheric pressure typically yield concentrations of ore metals in the parts per billion,,T to parts per million range. These vapors also commonly deposit appreciable quantities of ore minerals as sublimates. Much higher metal concentrations (from ppm to wt %) are observed in vapor inclusions trapped at pressures of 200 to 1,000 bars in deeper veins at lower temperatures (400 degrees-650 degrees C). Moreover, concentrations of some metals. notably Cu and Ali, are commonly higher in vapor inclusions than they are in inclusions of coexisting hypersaline liquid (brine). Experiments designed to determine the concentration of Cu, Sn, Ag, and An in HCl-bearing water vapor at variable although relatively low pressures (tip to 180 bars) partly explain this difference. These experiments show that metal solubility is orders of magnitude higher than predicted by volatility data for water-free systems, and furthermore that it increases sharply with increasing water fugacity and correlates positively with the fugacity of HCl. Thermodynamic analysis shows that metal solubility is greatly enhanced by reaction of the metal with 110 and by hydration, which results ill the formation of species Such as Nonetheless, the concentrations measured 1)), these experiments are considerably lower than those measured in experiments involving aqueous liquids or determined for vapor fluid inclusions. A possible explanation for this and for the apparent preference of metals such as Cu and Ali for the vapor over the coexisting brine ill some natural settings is suggested by limited experimental studies of metal partitioning between vapor and brine. These studies show that, whereas Cu, Fe, and Zn all partition strongly into the liquid ill chloride-bearing sulfur-free systems, Cu partitions preferentially into the vapor in the presence of significant concentrations of Sulfur. We therefore infer that high concentrations of Cu and An in vapor inclusions reflect the strong preference of sulfur for the vapor phase and the formation of sulfur-bearing metallic gas species.\n\nPhase stability relationships in the system NaCl-H2O indicate how vapor transport of metals may occur, in nature, by showing a range of possible vapor evolution paths for the conditions of porphyry-epithermal systems. At the world-class Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Au deposit, evidence from fluid inclusions supports a model in which a single-phase fluid of intermediate to vapor-like density ascends from a magma chamber. Oil cooling and decompression, this fluid condenses a small fraction of brine by intersecting the two-phase surface on the vapor side of the critical curve, without significantly changing the composition of the expanding vapor. Vapor and brine reach Cu-Fe sulfide saturation is both phases cool below 425 degrees C. Vapor, which is the dominant fluid ill terms of the total mass of H2O, Cu, and probably even Cl, is interpreted to be the main agent of metal transport. The evolution of fluids leading to high-grade epithermal gold mineralization is initiated by an H2S-, SO2-, Au-, and variably Cu- and As-rich vapor, which separates from an FeCl2-rich brine in a subjacent porphyry environment. In the early stages of the hydrothermal system, vapor expands rapidly and on reaching the epithermal environment, condenses, producing hypogene advanced argillic alteration and residual vuggy quartz and, in some cases, coeval high-sulfidation precious metal mineralization (e.g., Pascua). More commonly, the introduction of precious metals occurs somewhat later, after the site of magmatic fluid exsolution has receded to greater depth. Because of the relatively high pressure, the vapor separating from brine at this stage cools along a pressure-temperature path above the critical curve of the system, causing it to contract to a liquid capable of transporting several parts per million An to temperatures as low as 150 degrees C.", "ISSN": "0361-0128", "pub": "ECONOMIC GEOLOGY", "volume": "100", "authors": ["Williams-Jones, AE", "Heinrich, CA"], "issue": "7", "pages": "1287-1312"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/es048179r", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1219929325129/esthag-masthead.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 15 2005", "title": "Preparation and evaluation of GAC-based iron-containing adsorbents for arsenic removal", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es048179r", "abstract": "Granular activated carbon-based, iron-contain in g adsorbents (As-GAC) were developed for effective removal of arsenic from drinking water. Granular activated carbon (GAC) was used primarily as a supporting medium for ferric iron that was impregnated by ferrous chloride (FeCl2) treatment, followed by chemical oxidation. Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) was the most effective oxidant, and carbons produced from steam activation of lignite were most suitable for iron impregnation and arsenic removal. Two As-GAC materials prepared by FeCl2 treatment (0.025-0.40 M) of Dacro 20 x 50 and Dacro 20 x 40LI resulted in a maximum impregnated iron of 7.89% for Dacro 20 x 50 and 7.65% for Dacro 20 x 40 U. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analyses showed the BET specific surface area, total pore volume, porosity, and average mesoporous diameter all decreased with iron impregnation, indicating that some micropores were blocked. SEM studies with associated EDS indicated that the distribution of iron in the adsorbents was mainly on the edge of As-GAC in the low iron content (similar to 1% Fe) sample but extended to the center at the higher iron content (similar to 6% Fe). When the iron content was > similar to 7%, an iron ring formed at the edge of the GAC particles. No difference in X-ray diffraction patterns was observed between untreated GAC and the one with 4.12% iron, suggesting that the impregnated iron was predominantly in amorphous form. As-GAC could remove arsenic most efficiently when the iron content was approximately 6%; further increases of iron decreased arsenic adsorption.

Since this Fe has to be supplied via solution, the solubility and the dissolution rate of the Fe oxides are essential for the Fe supply.  Hydrolysis constants and solubility products (K(sp)) describing the effect of pH on FeIII ion concentration in solution are available for the well-known Fe oxides occurring in soils such as goethite, hematite, ferrihydrite.  K(sp) values are usually extremely low ((Fe3+).(OH)3 = 10(-37) - 10(-44)).  However, for each mineral type, K(sp) may increase by several orders of magnitude with decreasing crystal size and it decreases with increasing Al substitution assuming ideal solid solution between the pure end-members.  Based on such calculations a poorly crystalline goethite with a crystal size of 5 nm may well reach the solubility of ferrihydrite.  The variations in K(sp) are of relevance for soils because crystal size and Al substitution of soil Fe oxides vary considerably and can now be determined relatively easily.\n\nThe concentration of Fe2+ in soil solutions is often much higher than that of Fe(III) ions.  Therefore, redox potential strongly influences the activity of FeII.  At a given pH and E(h), the activity of FeII is higher the higher K(sp) of the FeIII oxide and thus also varies with the type of Fe oxide present.\n\nBesides the solubility, it is the dissolution rate which governs the supply of soluble Fe to the plant roots.  Dissolution of Fe oxides takes place either by protonation, complexation or, most important, by reduction.  Numerous dissolution rate studies with various FeIII oxides were conducted in strong mineral acids (protonation) and they have shown that besides the Fe oxide species, crystal size and/or crystal order and substitution are important determinative factors.  For example, in soils, small amounts of a more highly soluble meta- or instable Fe oxide such as ferrihydrite with a large specific surface (several hundred m2g-1) may be essential for the Fe supply to the plant root.  Its higher dissolution rate can also be used to quantify its amount in soils.  Ferrihydrite can be an important component in soils with high amounts of organic matter and/or active redox dynamics, whereas highly aerated and strongly weathered soils are usually very low in ferrihydrite.  On the other hand, dissolution rates of goethites decrease as their Al substitution increases.\n\nMuch less information exists on the rate of reductive and chelative dissolution of Fe oxides which generally simulate soil conditions better than dissolution by protonation.  Here again, type of oxide, crystal size and substitution are important factors.  Organic anions such as oxalate, which are adsorbed at the surface, may weaken the Fe3+-O bonds and thereby increase reductive dissolution.  As often observed in weathering, the dissolution features of the crystals appear to follow zones of weakness in the crystal.", "ISSN": "0032-079X", "pub": "PLANT AND SOIL", "volume": "130", "authors": ["SCHWERTMANN, U"], "issue": "1-2", "pages": "1-25"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0010-938X(95)00011-8", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010938X95000118/pdf?md5=a5a52381812c24cf58f7be857117e011&pid=1-s2.0-0010938X95000118-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL 1995", "title": "THE EFFECTS OF CHLORIDES, HYDROGEN-CHLORIDE, AND SULFUR-DIOXIDE IN THE OXIDATION OF STEELS BELOW DEPOSITS", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010938X95000118", "abstract": "Thermogravimetric studies have been conducted on the oxidation of a low alloy steel at 500 degrees C and high alloy steels at 600 and 700 degrees C in which either NaCl or a fly ash (from a waste incineration plant) was deposited on the scale of the steels after 24 h pre-oxidation.

Freeze-dried aqueous extract of potato peel powder (PPE) showed strong inhibitory activity toward lipid peroxidation of rat liver homogenate induced by the FeCl2-H2O2 system. Furthermore, PPE exhibited a strong concentration-dependent inhibition of deoxyribose oxidation. PPE also showed a considerable antioxidant activity in the DPPH radical assay system. The multiple antioxidant activity of PPE was evident as it showed strong reducing power, superoxide scavenging ability and also ferrous ion chelating potency. The data obtained in the in vitro models clearly establish the antioxidant potency of freeze-dried extract of potato peel. Considering that potato peels are discarded as waste and not effectively utilized, these in vitro results suggest the possibility that potato peel waste could be effectively employed as an ingredient in health or functional food, to alleviate oxidative stress.

The crystal structures of [FeCl2(TPA)]ClO4 (2) and [Fe2-OCl2(TPA)2](ClO4)2 (6) were determined, while other complexes were characterized by their visible and NMR spectra. Treatment of the mononuclear complexes with a stoichiometric amount of alkyl hydroperoxide in the presence of cyclohexane affords halocyclohexane in good yield. The production of bromo- and azidocyclohexane was correlated with the disappearance of the characteristic LMCT bands of the mononuclear catalysts, which were converted into catalytically inactive (mu-oxo)diferric species. The yield of haloalkane increased to 100% based on complex when an excess of alkyl hydroperoxide was used, but it was not affected by the addition of excess halide. The formation of haloalkane was inhibited by the presence of dimethyl sulfide (forming DMSO), but was unaffected by the addition of 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, suggesting the involvement of a two-electron oxidant in the reaction mechanism. The selectivities of the catalysts for cyclohexane and adamantane functionalization were significantly affected by the nature of the tripodal ligand and the bound halide but not by the alkyl group on the hydroperoxide.

The solutions were buffered in pH by a quartz monzonite and the pure potassium feldspar-muscovite-quartz assemblage and in f(s)2-f(o)2 largely by the assemblage pyrite-pyrrhotite-magnetite.\n\nSolubilities increase with increasing temperature and total chloride, and decrease with increasing pressure.  The rise in solubility is particularly steep between 300-degrees and 500-degrees-C and between 1,000 and 500 bars.  With increasing temperature at any given pressure, or with decreasing pressure at any given temperature, metal solubility eventually passes through a maximum due to increasing competition for chloride by the alkali, hydrogen, and base metal ions and because intersection with a two-fluid region eventually occurs.  In that portion of the two-fluid region encountered in the study, metal solubilities in the brine were very high, but solubilities in the gas phase also were significant.  In a system controlled by the potassium feldspar-muscovite-quartz buffer, 1-m total Cl-, and the assemblage pyrite-pyrrhotite-magnetite-sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite, solubilities in ppm at 1 kbar and 300-degrees, 400-degrees, and 500-degrees-C were 237, 1,216, and 5,636, for Fe; 51, 613, and 3,105 for Pb; 36, 423, and 2,649 for Zn; and 11, 40, and 113 for Cu, respectively.  At 400-degrees-C, 0.5 and 2 kbars, the values were 2,627 and 500 for Fe; 1,262 and 194 for Pb; 983 and 120 for Zn; and 60 and 29 for Cu, respectively.  All of the above were in the single-fluid region.  Single-metal solubilities also were investigated to assess the influence of iron on the solubility of the other metals and to corroborate preliminary dissociation constants for the metal chloride complexes involved.\n\nThe effect of increasing chloride concentration on solubility reflects primarily a shift to lower pH via the silicate buffer reactions.  The effect of decreasing pressure reflects primarily the relative change in the dissociation constants of the chloride complexes involved.  Increasing sulfur fugacity lowers solubility, but in systems controlled at relatively low values by an f(s)2 buffer or wall-rock sulfidation reactions, solutions of high metal content relative to reduced sulfur will tend to develop at high chloride concentrations.\n\nSimilarity in behavior with respect to the temperature and pressure of Fe, Zn, and Pb sulfide solubilities points to similarity in chloride speciation, and the neutral species appear to be dominant in the high-temperature region.

In the same animals a great stimulation of antioxidant enzymes glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase occurs. The prooxidant state induced by cadmium in liver mitochondria and microsomes is unaffected by superoxide dismutase, catalase, or mannitol, whereas it is completely blocked by vitamin E thus excluding the involvement of reactive oxygen species in this process. The mechanism by which cadmium in duces lipid peroxidation has been investigated by measuring the effect of this metal on liposomes. Ninety-minute treatment of liposomes with CdCl2 does not induce any lipid peroxidation. In contrast, Fe2+ ions under the same conditions cause strong liposome peroxidation. It has also been observed that cadmium promotes a time-dependent iron release from biological membranes, When lipid peroxidation is induced by a low concentration (5 mu M) of FeCl2, in place of CdCl2, the characteristics of this process and the sensitivity to the various antioxidants used are similar to those observed with Cd. From these results we conclude that the prooxidative effect of cadmium is an indirect one since it is mediated by iron.

These polyphase brine inclusions (halite +/- sylvite + multiple opaque and transparent daughter crystals) are interpreted as the most primitive magmatic fluid recorded at the level of the deposit, The are of moderately high salinity 50-60 wt% NaCl equiv) dominated by NaCl, KCl, and FeCl2, and contain on average 0.33 wt percent Cu and 0.55 ppm Au. Upon cooling and decompression, these saline liquids exsolve a vapor phase which is preferentially enriched in Cu relative to its main salt components but probably plays a minor role in the formation of this particular deposit because of the interred small mass fraction of vapor, Cooling and decompression from the highest initial P-T conditions down to about 450degreesC causes magnetite +/- K silicate alteration but no saturation in Au or Cu sulfides, as recorded by continually high ore metal concentrations in the fluid inclusions. Coprecipitation of Cu and Au as chalcopyrite and native gold (+/- some early bornite) occurs over a narrow range of decreasing fluid temperature, With cooling from similar to400degrees to 305degreesC, the Cu concentration in the brine drops by about one order of magnitude to less than similar to0.07 wt percent, without a proportional decrease in major salt components, Ore mineral precipitation extracts similar to85 percent of the Cu and Au from the fluid. It is associated with potassic alteration, as shown by a concomitant decrease in the K/Na ratio of the cooling magmatic brine and by an increase in its Ba and Sr concentrations (elements which are probably liberated in the destruction of calcic igneous minerals).\n\nThe fluid chemical data demonstrate that the metal ratios in this and probably many other porphyry-style ore deposits are primarily controlled by the magmatic source of the ore brines. On the other hand, the final hypogene ore grade of the deposit is controlled by the efficiency of ore mineral precipitation. At Alumbrera, metal extraction is governed by the efficiency of cooling a high flux of magmatic fluid within a small rock volume. Dilution of residual magmatic fluids, as recorded by aqueous fluid inclusions of decreasing salinities and temperatures below 295degreesC, follows after the main stage of copper introduction and its associated with feldspar-destructive (phyllic) alteration., Geometric relationships, fluid analyses, and stable isotope data together indicate that phyllic alteration results from postmineralization hydrothermal activity involving minor mixing between meteoric water, residual brine, and a waning input of magmatic vapor.", "ISSN": "0361-0128", "pub": "ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS", "volume": "96", "authors": ["Ulrich, T", "Gunther, D", "Heinrich, CA"], "issue": "8", "pages": "1743-1774"}, {"DOI": "10.1080/01490450252864280", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR-APR 2002", "title": "Influence of biogenic Fe(II) on bacterial crystalline Fe(III) oxide reduction", "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490450252864280", "abstract": "Bacterial crystalline Fe(III) oxide reduction has the potential to significantly influence the biogeochemistry of anaerobic sedimentary environments where crystalline Fe(III) oxides are abundant relative to poorly crystalline (amorphous) phases. A review of published data on solid-phase Fe(III) abundance and speciation indicates that crystalline Fe(III) oxides are frequently 2- to, greater than or equal to10-fold more abundant than amorphous Fe(III) oxides in shallow subsurface sediments not yet subjected to microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction activity. Incubation experiments with coastal plain aquifer sediments demonstrated that crystalline Fe(III) oxide reduction can contribute substantially to Fe(II) production in the presence of added electron donors and nutrients. Controls on crystalline Fe(III) oxide reduction are therefore an important consideration in relation to the biogeochemical impacts of bacterial Fe(III) oxide reduction in subsurface environments. In this paper, the influence of biogenic Fe(II) on bacterial reduction of crystalline Fe(III) oxides is reviewed and analyzed in light of new experiments conducted with the acetate-oxidizing, Fe(III)-reducing bacterium (FeRB) Geobacter metallireducens. Previous experiments with Shewanella algae strain BrY indicated that adsorption and/or surface precipitation of Fe(II) on Fe(III) oxide and FeRB cell surfaces is primarily responsible for cessation of goethite (alpha-FeOOH) reduction activity after only a relatively small fraction (generally <10%) of the oxide is reduced. Similar conclusions are drawn from analogous studies with G: metallireducens. Although accumulation of aqueous Fe(II) has the potential to impose thermodynamic constraints on the extent of crystalline Fe(III) oxide reduction, our data on bacterial goethite reduction suggest that this phenomenon cannot universally explain the low microbial reducibility of this mineral. Experiments examining the influence of exogenous Fe(II) (20 mM FeCl(2)) on soluble Fe(III)-citrate reduction by G: metallireducens and S: algae showed that high concentrations of Fe(II) did not inhibit Fe(III)-citrate reduction by freshly grown cells, which indicates that surface-bound Fe(II) does not inhibit Fe(III) reduction through a classical end-product enzyme inhibition mechanism. However, prolonged exposure of G: metallireducens and S: algae cells to high concentrations of soluble Fe( II) did cause inhibition of soluble Fe(III) reduction. These findings, together with recent documentation of the formation of Fe(II) surface precipitates on FeRB in Fe(III)-citrate medium, provide further evidence for the impact of Fe(II) sorption by FeRB on enzymatic Fe(III) reduction. Two different, but not mutually exclusive, mechanisms whereby accumulation of Fe(II) coatings on Fe(III) oxide and FeRB surfaces may lead to inhibition of enzymatic Fe(III) oxide reduction activity (in the absence of soluble electron shuttles and/or Fe(III) chelators) are identified and discussed in relation to recent experimental work and theoretical considerations.", "ISSN": "0149-0451", "pub": "GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL", "volume": "19", "authors": ["Roden, EE", "Urrutia, MM"], "issue": "2", "pages": "209-251"}, {"DOI": "10.1111/j.1471-4159.1984.tb12699.x", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1984", "title": "INVIVO LIPID-PEROXIDATION IN RAT-BRAIN FOLLOWING INTRACORTICAL FE-2+ INJECTION", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.1984.tb12699.x/abstract;jsessionid=97377918E7859F04644FDC03B2DC5B31.f01t01", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-3042", "pub": "JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY", "volume": "42", "authors": ["TRIGGS, WJ", "WILLMORE, LJ"], "issue": "4", "pages": "976-980"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.poly.2005.08.029", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277538705005784/pdfft?md5=0e80730651c83eee3bd476c46277838a&pid=1-s2.0-S0277538705005784-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 23 2006", "title": "Mixed 3d/4d and 3d/4f metal clusters: Tetranuclear (Fe2M2III)-M-III (M-III = Ln, Y) and (Mn2M2III)-M-IV (M = Yb, Y) complexes, and the first Fe/4f single-molecule magnets", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277538705005784", "abstract": "The synthesis, structure and magnetic properties are reported of Fe(2)Ln(2), Fe2Y2, Mn2Yb2 and Mn2Y2 complexes.

This process takes advantage of carbon-radical intermediates, which tolerate a variety of functional groups in monomers and reaction media. \"Transition metal-catalyzed living radical polymerization\", one of these living systems, has widely been employed for precision polymer synthesis. Not only can this process produce well-defined functional polymers, but it can also generate hybrids or conjugates with other (often biological) materials. Metal-catalyzed systems retain the advantages of conventional radical polymerization but distinguish themselves through a catalytic reversible halogen exchange equilibrium: the growing radical exists alongside a dormant species-a covalent precursor capped with a terminal halogen from an initiator. The catalyst dictates the selectivity, exchange rate, and control over the polymerization.\n\nThis Account provides an updated overview of our group's efforts in transition metal-catalyzed living radical polymerization with specific emphasis on the design of metal catalysts and the resulting precision polymer syntheses. With increasing use of the living processes as convenient tools for materials synthesis, researchers are currently seeking more active and versatile metal catalysts that are tolerant to functional groups. Such catalysts would enable a wider range of applications and target products, would have low metal content, could be readily removed from products, and would allow recycling. Since we first developed the \"transition metal-catalyzed living radical polymerization\" with RuCl2(PPh3)(3), FeCl2(PPh3)(2), and NiBr2(PPh3)(2), we have strived to systematically design metal catalysts to meet these new demands. For example, we have enhanced catalytic activity and control through several modifications: electron-donating or resonance-enhancing groups, moderate bulkiness, heterochelation via a ligand, and halogen-donor additives. For some catalysts, the use of amphiphilic and polymeric ligands allow efficient recovery of catalysts and convenient use in aqueous media.

The catalyzed chain growth process is characterized by an exceptionally fast and reversible exchange of the growing polymer chains between the iron and zinc centers. Upon hydrolysis of the resultant ZnR2 product, a Poisson distribution of linear alkanes is obtained; linear alpha-olefins with a Poisson distribution can be generated via a nickel-catalyzed displacement reaction. Other dialkylzinc reagents such as ZnMe2 and (ZnPr2)-Pr-i also show catalyzed chain growth; in the case of ZnMe2 a slight broadening of the product distribution is observed. The products obtained from Zn(CH2Ph)(2) show evidence for chain transfer but not catalyzed chain growth, whereas ZnPh2 shows no evidence for chain transfer.

However, Si, Ca, Al, Mg, Ti, V, and Cr are actually more concentrated in solids, beta-quartz (SiO2), wollastonite (CaSiO3), anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), diopside (CaMgSi2O6), sphene (CaTiSiO5), V2O3(c), and Cr2O3(C), respectively, than in their most abundant gaseous species, SiF4, CaCl2, AlF2O, MgCl2, TiCl4, VOCl3, and CrO2Cl2. These computed solids are not degassing products, but reflect contaminants in our gas condensates or possible problems with our modeling due to \"missing\" gas species in the thermochemical data base.\n\nUsing the calculated distribution of gas species and the COSPEC SO2 fluxes, we have estimated the emission rates for many species (e.g., COS, NaCl, KCl, HBr, AsS, CuCl). Such forecasts could be useful to evaluate the effects of these trace species on atmospheric chemistry.\n\nBecause of the high volatility of metal chlorides (e.g., FeCl2, NaCl, KCl, MnCl2, CuCl), the extremely HCl-rich Augustine volcanic gases are favorable for transporting metals from magma. Thermochemical modeling shows that equilibrium degassing of magma near 870-degrees-C can account for the concentrations of Fe, Na, K, Mn, Cu, Ni, and part of the Mg in the gases escaping from the dome fumaroles on the 1986 lava dome. These calculations also explain why gases escaping from the lower temperature but highly oxidized moat vents on the 1976 lava dome should transport less Fe, Na, K, Mn, and Ni, but more Cu; oxidation may also account for the larger concentrations of Zn and Mo in the moat gases.\n\nNonvolatile elements (e.g., Al, Ca, Ti, Si) in the gas condensates came from eroded rock particles that dissolved in our samples or, for Si, from contamination from the silica sampling tube. Only a very small amount of rock contamination occurred (water/rock ratios between 10(4) and 10(6)) . Erosion is more prevalent in the pyroclastic flow fumaroles than in the summit vents, reflecting physical differences in the fumarole walls: ash vs. lava. Trace element contents of volcanic gases show enormous variability because of differences in the intensive parameters of degassing magma and variable amounts of wall rock erosion in volcanic fumaroles.", "ISSN": "0016-7037", "pub": "GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA", "volume": "56", "authors": ["SYMONDS, RB", "REED, MH", "ROSE, WI"], "issue": "2", "pages": "633-657"}, {"DOI": "10.1111/j.1471-4159.1985.tb08755.x", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1985", "title": "LIPID PEROXIDATION-INDUCED INHIBITION OF GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID UPTAKE IN RAT-BRAIN SYNAPTOSOMES - PROTECTION BY GLUCOCORTICOIDS", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.1985.tb08755.x/abstract;jsessionid=D256D07B414A738814118494E9C814A6.f02t01", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-3042", "pub": "JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY", "volume": "44", "authors": ["BRAUGHLER, JM"], "issue": "4", "pages": "1282-1288"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/om020818o", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861392520/orgnd7-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 17 2003", "title": "Fluoro-substituted 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl iron and cobalt complexes: High-activity ethylene oligomerization catalysts", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/om020818o", "abstract": "Six five-coordinate difluoro-substituted 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl iron and cobalt complexes, [12,6-(2,X-F2C6H3N=CCH3)(2)C5H3N}MCl2] (X = 6, M = Fe (1), Co (2); X = 5, M = Fe (3), Co (4)); X = 4, M = Fe (5), Co (6), were synthesized by reactions of the corresponding bis(imino)pyridyl ligands with FeCl2.4H(2)O or COCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF).

The present study is undertaken to identify such a ROS. We prepared heavily glycated human serum albumin (HSA) which contained a high level of Amadori products, but an undetectable level of CML. Incubation of glycated HSA with FeCl2, but not with H2O2, led to CML formation which was enhanced by H2O2, but inhibited by catalase or mannitol, whereas superoxide dismutase had no effect, Similar data were obtained by experiments using Boc-fructose-lysine as a model Amadori compound, These data indicate that hydroxyl radical generated by the reaction of Fe2+ with H2O2 mediates CML formation from Amadori compounds.

The strong H dependence of the rigidity of the FLL is used to explore the crossover between interaction-dominated and disorder-dominated dynamics. Three distinct types of dynamics, describing elastic flow, plastic flow and fluid flow, respectively, are observed as the lattice softens with the approach to the superconducting-to-normal phase boundary. A power-law behavior, V similar to (I-I-c)(beta), describes the I-V curves for both elastic and fluid flow (with different beta) reasonably well, but not for plastic flow. The latter dominates the intermediate regime, where the peak effect occurs, and is accompanied by qualitative changes in the I-V curves related to tearing of the FLL. In this regime, a ''fingerprint phenomenon'' is observed in the current-dependent differential resistance describing a specific sequence of depinning of ''chunks'' or filaments in a given sample. At large driving forces, the disorder due to pinning is less significant, the dynamically generated defects heal and a nearly defect-free coherent motion is recovered. In some samples, the I-V curves at the onset of motion in this regime become discontinuous and hysteretic as in first-order transitions. A ''non-equilibrium phase diagram'' describing various regimes of dynamics is constructed. A time-averaged velocity correlation length characterizes the spatial inhomogeneity of a moving FLL and thus distinguishes between the various dynamical regimes.

For an alternating current, only narrow regions near the edges are in the disordered phase, while for d.c. bias, most of the sample is in the disordered phase-preventing vortex motion because of more efficient pinning.

Moreover, the magnetic vortex system is highly tunable and permits questions concerning frictional, plastic and elastic flow(9) to be investigated on the,scale of single vortices.

In a type II superconductor, a flux-Line lattice (FLL) forms if a magnetic field between H-cl and H-c2, the lower and upper critical fields, is applied: flowing electrical currents will exert a force on this PLL.

The idea is that if Fermi surface contours coincide when shifted along the observed CDW wave vector, then the CDW is considered to be nesting derived. We show that, in most cases, this procedure has no predictive power, since Fermi surfaces either do not nest at the right wave vector or nest more strongly at the wrong vector. We argue that only a tiny fraction, if any, of the observed charge ordering phase transitions are true analogs of the Peierls instability because electronic instabilities are easily destroyed by even small deviations from perfect nesting conditions. By using prototypical CDW materials NbSe2, TaSe2, and CeTe3, we show that such conditions are hardly ever fulfilled and that the CDW phases are actually structural phase transitions driven by the concerted action of electronic and ionic subsystems, i.e., a q-dependent electron-phonon coupling plays an indispensable part.

At about 420 K, both resistivity and susceptibility show an anomaly which results from a spin-state transition of cobalt at this temperature. Below 300 K, the resistivity measured along the CoO2 layers shows a metal-insulator transition as T decreases, whereas the much larger out-of-plane resistivity values show the anisotropic behavior of this phase. The application of a magnetic field induces a negative magnetoresistance which reaches -35% for 7 T.

The use of dry plastic lithium-ion battery technology has allowed the construction of an in situ x-ray diffraction cell which allows structural characterization of Li2CoO2 at x values at and close to 0 for the first time. Instead of the expected destruction of the core structure of LiCoO2 by a drastic increase in structural disorder, an increase in crystallographic quality occurred as It approached 0.

The obtained data are used to establish a rich phase diagram centered at the \"parent\" compound GdBaCo2O5.5-an insulator with Co ions in the 3+ state. An attractive feature of GdBaCo2O5+x is that it allows a precise and continuous doping of CoO2 planes with either electrons or holes, spanning a wide range from the charge-ordered insulator at 50% electron doping (x=0) to the undoped band insulator (x=0.5), and further towards the heavily hole-doped metallic state. This continuous doping is clearly manifested in the behavior of thermoelectric power which exhibits a spectacular divergence with approaching x=0.5, where it reaches large absolute values (+/- 800 mu V/K) and abruptly changes its sign. At low temperatures, the homogeneous distribution of doped carriers in GBCO becomes unstable, as is often the case with strongly correlated systems, and both the magnetic and transport properties point to an intriguing nanoscopic phase separation into two insulating phases (for electron-doped region) or an insulating and a metallic phase (for hole-doped region). We also find that throughout the composition range the magnetic behavior in GBCO is governed by a delicate balance between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions, which can be easily affected by temperature, doping, or magnetic field, bringing about FM-AF transitions and a giant magnetoresistance (MR) phenomenon. What distinguishes GBCO from the colossal-MR manganites is an exceptionally strong uniaxial anisotropy of the Co spins, which dramatically simplifies the possible spin arrangements.

The anhydrous parent compound Na0.61(1)CoO2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third. The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D2O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D2O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D2O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO2 layers. This coordination of Na by four D2O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D2O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data.

At 27 K, a small shoulder in the chi(T) curve was observed only for Hperpendicular toab, indicating the formation of an incommensurate spin-density-wave (SDW) state, which was also confirmed by independent muon spin rotation and relaxation experiments. The lowest of T-ferri is a transition to a ferrimagnetic state, for which also a ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop was observed for Hperpendicular toab, but not for Hparallel toab. This anisotropic behavior indicated that the ferrimagnetic interaction is parallel to the c axis.

The use of dry plastic lithium-ion battery technology has allowed the construction of an in situ x-ray diffraction cell which allows structural characterization of Li2CoO2 at x values at and close to 0 for the first time. Instead of the expected destruction of the core structure of LiCoO2 by a drastic increase in structural disorder, an increase in crystallographic quality occurred as It approached 0.

The most fundamental of those characteristics, for both the copper oxides and other superconductors, is the dependence of the superconducting T-c on the degree of electronic band filling. The recent report of superconductivity 1 near 4 K in the layered sodium cobalt oxyhydrate, Na0.35CoO2.1.3H(2)O, is of interest owing to both its triangular cobalt-oxygen lattice and its generally analogous chemical and structural relationships to the copper oxide superconductors.

The obtained data are used to establish a rich phase diagram centered at the \"parent\" compound GdBaCo2O5.5-an insulator with Co ions in the 3+ state. An attractive feature of GdBaCo2O5+x is that it allows a precise and continuous doping of CoO2 planes with either electrons or holes, spanning a wide range from the charge-ordered insulator at 50% electron doping (x=0) to the undoped band insulator (x=0.5), and further towards the heavily hole-doped metallic state. This continuous doping is clearly manifested in the behavior of thermoelectric power which exhibits a spectacular divergence with approaching x=0.5, where it reaches large absolute values (+/- 800 mu V/K) and abruptly changes its sign. At low temperatures, the homogeneous distribution of doped carriers in GBCO becomes unstable, as is often the case with strongly correlated systems, and both the magnetic and transport properties point to an intriguing nanoscopic phase separation into two insulating phases (for electron-doped region) or an insulating and a metallic phase (for hole-doped region). We also find that throughout the composition range the magnetic behavior in GBCO is governed by a delicate balance between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions, which can be easily affected by temperature, doping, or magnetic field, bringing about FM-AF transitions and a giant magnetoresistance (MR) phenomenon. What distinguishes GBCO from the colossal-MR manganites is an exceptionally strong uniaxial anisotropy of the Co spins, which dramatically simplifies the possible spin arrangements.

The anhydrous parent compound Na0.61(1)CoO2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third. The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D2O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D2O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D2O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO2 layers. This coordination of Na by four D2O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D2O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data.

Our calculations demonstrate that removal of Li from the cubic phase results in movement of the Li atoms from their original octahedral sites-to tetrahedral sites, forming a low-energy LiCo2O4 spine structure. The energetics of the spinel phase are shown to account for the observed marked differences in battery voltages between the cubic and layered phases of LiCoO2. A small energy barrier exists for Li motion between octahedral and tetrahedral sites, thus indicating the metastability of the high-energy octahedral sites. Finally, we point out a possible pressure-induced layered --> cubic transition in LiCoO2.", "ISSN": "0013-4651", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "145", "authors": ["Wolverton, C", "Zunger, A"], "issue": "7", "pages": "2424-2431"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja00093a026", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL 13 1994", "title": "DIOXYGEN BINDING IN IRON AND COBALT PICNIC BASKET PORPHYRINS", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00093a026", "abstract": "The synthesis and characterization of a series of iron and cobalt ''picnic basket'' porphyrins are described. Dioxygen binding to iron and cobalt picnic basket porphyrins has been studied by H-1 NMR and oxygen affinity measurements. These iron and cobalt picnic basket porphyrins bind dioxygen reversibly at room temperature with high affinities. The oxygen affinity increases as the basket size decreases. This effect indicates that a dipole-dipole interaction between the terminally bound dioxygen and the amide protons may play a role in the stability of the oxygen adducts. H-1 NMR spectroscopy does not support the existence of a strong H-bond in these picnic basket porphyrins. Oxygen affinities of the cobalt picnic basket porphyrins are more sensitive to the change of basket sizes than are the corresponding iron porphyrins.

The highest spin state (SS) transition was found to be discontinuous with the appearance of a thermal hysteresis loop about 20 K wide. At 27 K, a small shoulder in the chi(T) curve was observed only for Hperpendicular toab, indicating the formation of an incommensurate spin-density-wave (SDW) state, which was also confirmed by independent muon spin rotation and relaxation experiments. The lowest of T-ferri is a transition to a ferrimagnetic state, for which also a ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop was observed for Hperpendicular toab, but not for Hparallel toab. This anisotropic behavior indicated that the ferrimagnetic interaction is parallel to the c axis.

Alkyl aromatic compounds were oxidized to aldehydes, ketones and acids by molecular oxygen mediated by transition metal catalysts in subcritical water. A number of alkyl aromatics were oxidized directly to their acids, including p-xylene, o-xylene, m-xylene, ethylbenzene, and toluene. Alternatively, conditions were discovered which allowed the oxidation reactions to stop at the aldehyde stage. In addition, several aromatic methylenes could be oxidized to ketones, and anthracene could be oxidized to anthraquinone under the same conditions. The syntheses were performed in 10 mi stainless steel and Hastelloy-C 276 batch reactors between 300 and 355 degrees C with up to five equivalents of O-2. The reactions were found to be very sensitive to the nature of the catalysts, with MnBr2 and CoBr2 providing the cleanest reactions and highest yields.

The catalysts were tested for the reduction of NOx with CH4 or iso-C4H10 in excess O-2. Below 425 degreesC the SUB catalysts show the highest NOx reduction activity with CH4 or iso-C4H10. Above 425 degreesC, the best performance is given by WIE. Below the temperature of maximum N-2 yield, a mixture of Fe/FER and WIE is superior to either catalyst. Addition of 10% H2O to the feed drastically decreases the N-2 yield in NOx reduction with CH4, but increases the activity with iso-C4H10 under some conditions. Permanent damage of the zeolite lattice as a potential cause for the adverse effect of H2O in the tests with CH4 is eliminated, as the original activity is fully restored after calcination. A 100 h test with a wet iso-C4H10 feed shows excellent stability with a SUB catalyst prepared from CoBr2.\n\nCharacterization by XRD, H-2-TPR, and FTIR reveals that WIE contains isolated Co2+ and (Co-OH)(+) ions that are only reducible at 700 degreesC. SUB catalysts show additional TPR peaks at low temperature, including a feature at 220-250 degreesC, ascribed to multinuclear Co oxo-ions. The formation of an NOy chemisorption complex is most rapid on these catalysts. No oxidation states between Co-0 and Co2+ are detectable; the one-step reduction of Co2+ to Co-0 clusters could be a cause for the unique propensity of Co/MFI to reduce NOx with CH4.

NEW PENDANT METHYLPYRIDYL COSTA-TYPE ORGANOCOBALT COMPLEXES PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE ROLE OF THE AXIAL LIGAND IN BUTTERFLY BENDING AND REDOX PROPERTIES", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00043a015", "abstract": "A new B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) model system with the potentially quinquedentate ligand, 2,3,9,10-tetramethyl-6,2-pyridylmethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazaundeca-1,3,8,10-tetraen-1,11-diolo (C1py), has unique properties attributable to the coordinated pendant pyridine, which is attached covalently at thc 2-position by a one-methylene link to the central C of the propylene chain of (DO)(DOH)pn (N2,N2'-propanediylbis(2,3-butanedione 2-imine 3-oxime)). Treatment of C1py, constructed from the new diamine, 2-(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,3-propanediamine, with hydrated CoBr2 afforded [BrCo(C1py)]ClO4 (5). From 5, salts of [XCo(C1py)]+ (X = CN, N3, Cl) and of [RCo(C1py)]+ (R = CH3, i-C3H7, neo-C5H11, CH2CF3) were synthesized by substitution and by oxidative addition of RX to in situ generated Co(I)(C1py), respectively. In contrast to previous model systems, the C1py model behaves more like Cbls; for example, no dicyano complex was obtained. Coordination of the pyridyl moiety in the C1py derivatives is confirmed by X-ray structural analysis of [ClCo(C1py)]PF6 (7) and [CH3Co(C1py)](ClO4/BF4) (9a). The pendant arm forces the pyridine to adopt an orientation 90-degrees different from that in the [pyCo((DO)(DOH)pn)Cl(or R)]PF6 derivatives. This new orientation greatly decreases butterfly bending, a structural feature relevant to triggering of Co-C bond homolysis by B12 enzymes. This result is strong evidence that a planar N-donor ligand can induce butterfly bending. In 7 the axial Co-N distance is 1.959 (4) angstrom, shorter than this distance (2.06 (1) and 2.07 (1) angstrom, for two independent molecules) in 9a and similar to that in [pyCo((DO)(DOH)pn)Cl]PF6. Although electrochemical reduction of the latter was not reversible, the reversible formation of Co(II) and Co(I) species from 7 (and 5) can be attributed to the pendant nature of the axial pyridine. The Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple was more cathodic for 7, consistent with better electron donation by the pendant pyridine. The Co(II)/Co(I) redox potential (-1.0 V vs 0.01 M Ag+/Ag) of 7 and 5 was similar to that for nonalkyl (DO)(DOH)pn derivatives, which lack a pendant base; this suggests that Co(II)/Co(I) reduction in nonalkyl C1py derivatives proceeds through a base-off form in which the Co-pyridine interaction is weak, at best. Such a mechanism was proposed previously for Cbls. For both [CNCo(C1py)]ClO4 and cyanoCbl (vitamin B12), a single two-electron wave was observed upon reduction. For alkylC1py derivatives, only one cathodic wave was observed upon reduction. Just one prominent cathodic peak has been reported for alkylCbls. For [CH3Co(C1py)]ClO4 (9), reduction formed a dealkylated Co(I) species, which was oxidized to Co(II) on the reverse anodic scan. Similarly, dealkylated Co(I) species formed after one-electron reduction of alkylCbls, including methylCbl, are oxidized to Cbl(II) in the return anodic scan. The Co(III)/Co(II) reduction potentials of C1py and Cbl derivatives were influenced nearly identically by changes in the axial ligand; for R(or X) = solvent, Cl, CN, neo-C5H11, CH3, an excellent correlation with a slope of unity was obtained. The simpler chemistry of the C1py derivatives, as illustrated here by electrochemical studies, makes them excellent models to study fundamental chemistry relevant to Cbls.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "114", "authors": ["GERLI, A", "SABAT, M", "MARZILLI, LG"], "issue": "17", "pages": "6711-6718"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0040-4039(00)01163-1", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403900011631/pdfft?md5=5909a20816961a9f2c12545139f6b71c&pid=1-s2.0-S0040403900011631-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 26 2000", "title": "An improved cobalt catalyst for homo Diels-Alder reactions of acyclic 1,3-dienes with alkynes", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403900011631", "abstract": "An efficient cobalt(I)-catalysed home Diels-Alder reaction of acyclic 1,3-dienes and acetylene derivatives is described.

The UV-VIS spectral analysis for pure PVA shows absorption bands at 265 and 280 nm, which were assigned to the presence of carbonyl groups. The addition of CrF3 led to the appearance of another bands at 418 and 596 nm. The filling level and/or UV irradiation have no effect on the position of absorption bands but the intensity of these bands has been changed.

Two basic structural types for the complexes MX2L (M = Ni, Co, Cu, Pd; L = bpmdmit or bpedmit; X = Cl or Br) were determined by X-ray crystallography. The cobalt(II) and the nickel(II) complexes CoBr2(bpmdmit) and NiCl2(bpmdmit) show octahedral geometries around the metal ions with coordination to the metal ions by the pyridyl nitrogen atoms and the thioether sulfur atoms of the ligand and cis coordination of the halide ions. By contrast, only the pyridyl nitrogen atom of the ligands in the copper(II) and the palladium(II) complexes, CuCl2(bpedmit) and PdCl2(bpedmit), are coordinated to the metal ions to give essentially square planar metal environments. The copper complex was isolated as both green and purple crystals. However, the X-ray structures of both forms are similar, and show a dimeric arrangement with bis-mu-chloride bridges between the copper ions in the dimeric units. The green crystals contain two molecules of acetonitrile in the unit cell, however these do not interact with the metal ions. The geometry of the copper ions in the green form deviates most from centrosymmetric square planar geometry and this is consistent with the observed colour. Apart from the colour, the solids can be distinguished in the solid state by EPR spectroscopy since they give different rhombic signals. UV-Vis and EPR spectroscopy show that in solution the structures of the purple and green forms of CuCl2(bpedmit) are identical, as expected.

These new ligands react with FeBr2 to give either purple, low-spin Fe[(p-IC6H4)B(PZ)(3)](2) or colorless, high-spin Fe[(p-IC6H4)B(3-Mepz)(3)](2). Depending upon the crystallization conditions, Fe[(p-IC6H4)B(3-Mepz)(3)](2) can exist both as two polymorphs and as a methylene chloride solvate. An examination of these polymorphs by variable-temperature X-ray crystallography, magnetic susceptibility, and Mossbauer spectroscopy has revealed different electronic spin-state crossover properties for each polymorph and yields insight into the influence of crystal packing, independent of other electronic perturbations, on the spin-state crossover. The first polymorph of Fe[(p-IC6H4)B(3-Mepz)(3)](2) has a highly organized three-dimensional supramolecular structure and does not undergo a spin-state crossover upon cooling to 4 K. The second polymorph of Fe[(p-IC6H4)B(3-MePZ)(3)](2) has a stacked two-dimensional supramolecular structure, a structure that is clearly less well organized than that of the first polymorph, and undergoes an abrupt iron(II) spin-state crossover from high spin to low spin upon cooling below ca. 130 K. The crystal structure of the methylene chloride solvate of Fe[(p-IC6H4)B(3-Mepz)(3)](2) has a similar stacked two-dimensional supramolecular structure, but the crystals readily lose the solvate. The resulting desolvate undergoes a gradual spin-state crossover to the low-spin state upon cooling below ca. 235 K. It is clear from a comparison of the structures that the long-range solid-state organization of the molecules, which is controlled by noncovalent supramolecular interactions, has a strong impact upon the spin-state crossover, with the more highly organized structures having lower spin-crossover temperatures and more abrupt spin-crossover behavior.", "ISSN": "0020-1669", "pub": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "volume": "44", "authors": ["Reger, DL", "Gardinier, JR", "Smith, MD", "Shahin, AM", "Long, GJ", "Rebbouh, L", "Grandjean, F"], "issue": "6", "pages": "1852-1866"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.460212", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/jcp/94/11/1.460212.pdf;jsessionid=10kxt9vstr4cv.x-aip-live-02?itemId=/content/aip/journal/jcp/94/11/10.1063/1.460212&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/jcp", "pubDate": "JUN 1 1991", "title": "MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE OF 1ST-ROW TRANSITION-METAL DIHALIDES FROM COMBINED ELECTRON-DIFFRACTION AND VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS", "DOIlink": "http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/94/11/10.1063/1.460212", "abstract": "The average and equilibrium molecular geometries and vibrational characteristics of MnCl2, FeCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, MnBr2, FeBr2, CoBr2, and NiBr2 have been determined by a combined analysis of gas-phase electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopic data.  The nozzle temperatures ranged between 960 and 1100 K in the electron diffraction experiments, paralleled with mass spectrometric control of the vapor composition.  Four approximations have been examined for the molecular Hamiltonian in the joint analysis.  The overall utility of combined analysis has been demonstrated.  The dynamic behavior of the first-row transition metal dihalides is best described by the semirigid model.  The equilibrium bond distance is best approximated by the cubic anharmonic potential.  The cubic force constants and the bond Morse anharmonicity parameter can be determined even from electron diffraction data alone provided that experimental information is collected to large enough scattering angles.  The present analysis has confirmed the linearity of equilibrium configuration for all dihalides studied.

Our interest in amidate coordination prompted an investigation of the iron complexes of the potentially tetradentate ligand N-(bis(2-pyridyl)methyl)pyridine-2-carboxamide (H-L). A number of complexes have been isolated and structurally characterized, including [Fe-4(III)(L)(2)] (1), [Fe-III(L-OCH3)Br-2(CH3OH)] (3), [Fe-2(III) (mu-OH)(2)(L-OCH3)(2)Br-2](4), and [Fe-4(III) (mu-OCH3)(2)(L-O)(2)Br-6] (5). In these complexes L acts as a meridional tridentate ligand, as previously observed for the corresponding [Cu(L)Cl(CH3OH)] complex (Inorg. Chem. 39 (2000) 5326). In the cases of 3 and 4, the hydrogen of the tertiary carbon has been replaced by a methoxy group in the course of complex synthesis. In the case of 5, the tertiary hydrogen is replaced by hydroxide, and this oxygen and the dangling pyridine act as a bidentate ligand to a second iron ion. When the reaction of FeBr3 and H-L was carried out in acetonitrile in the presence of base but in the absence of air, the ligand was cleaved into two pieces, affording [(FeBr2)-Br-II(pyridine-2-carboxamide)(di-2-pyridylketone)] (6). It is proposed that the coordination of the amide nitrogen of H-L to an iron(III) center as an amidate activates the alpha-C-H bond and results in the oxidation of the alpha-C-N-amide bond to an imine.

The optimal reaction conditions for Cu(I) halide, CuSCN, and Fe(II) halide-mediated ATRP systems with 2,2'-bipyridine and its 4,4'-dialkyl-substituted derivatives as ligands were determined. Cu(I)-mediated systems were better controlled than Fe(II)-mediated ones under the examined conditions. A bipyridine-type ligand with a critical length of the substituted alkyl group (i.e., 4,4'-dihexyl 2,2'-bipyridine) exhibited the best performance in Cu(I)-mediated systems, and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate could effectively initiate Cu(I)-mediated ATRP of MMA, resulting in polymers with low polydispersities in most cases. Besides, Cu(I) halide-mediated ATRP with 4,5'-dimethyl 2,2'-bipyridine as the ligand and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride as the initiator proved to be better controlled than those with 4,4'-dimethyl 2,2'-bipyridine as the ligand, and polymers with much lower polydispersities were obtained in the former cases. This successful HTE example opens up a way to significantly accelerate the development of new catalytic systems for ATRP and to improve the understanding of structure-property relationships of the reaction systems.

While the ligand field gradient tensor components change relatively little with the method applied, the iron electric field gradient is sensitive to the specific density functional used. Single reference many-body perturbation theory for electron correlation also performs poorly for the iron electric field gradient and shows extreme oscillatory behavior with a change in the order of the perturbation series. Even with larger basis sets and coupled cluster techniques a precise value for the iron electric field gradient could not be determined from electronic structure calculations due to limitations in the theoretical procedures. In order to avoid uncertainties in the measured isomer shift which enters into the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant we determined the Mossbauer spectrum of Fe(C5H5)(2) between temperatures of 4.2 and 295 K. In this range two phase transitions are observed, but the quadrupole splitting is not very dependent on the solid state structure in each phase. Solid state effects for the Fe(CO)(5) are determined by comparing the iron electric field gradient of the isolated molecule with the value obtained from first principle solid state calculations at various levels of theory. These calculations show that the influence of near neighboring effects to the iron electric field gradient is small. Fully relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations for Fe(CO)(5) reveal that relativistic effects for the iron electric field gradient are small as well. Fe(CO)(5) is therefore an ideal test molecule for the determination of an accurate nuclear quadrupole moment from electronic structure calculations if combined with an experimental nuclear quadrupole coupling constant. Our best estimate for the Fe-57 nuclear quadropole moment is 0.14(2) barn in reasonable agreement with recent nuclear structure calculations.

In situ introduction of P-N chelate-ligands, consisting of hetero-coordinating atoms [phosphine (P) and nitrogene (N)], onto FeBr2 effectively catalyzed living radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in conjunction with a bromide initiator, where the monomer-conversion reached over 90% without dropping the rates and the molecular weights of obtained PMMAs were well controlled. The benign effects of the \"hetero-chelation\" were demonstrated by comparative experiments with homo-chelate ligands (P-P, N-N), model compounds of the composed coordination site, and the combinations. We successfully achieved an isolation of iron complex with a P-N ligand [FeBr2(DMD]PE); DMDPE: (R)-N,N-dimethyl-1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)-ethanamine], which was superior to the conventional catalyst [FeBr2(Pn-Bu)(2)] with respect to controllability and activity, especially at the latter stage.

The effect of the catalytic system on ATRP was studied systematically. Most of the polymerizations with DPPMP ligand were well controlled with a linear increase in the number-average molecular weights (M-n) versus conversion and relatively low molecular weight distributions (M-w/M-n = 1.10-1.3) being observed throughout the reactions, and the measured molecular weights matched the predicted values. Initially added iron(III) bromide improved the controllability of the polymerization reactions in terms of molecular weight control. The ratio of ligand to metal influenced the controllability of ATRP system, and the optimum ratio was found to be 2:1. It was shown that ATRP of MMA with FeX2/DPPMP catalytic system (X = Cl, Br) initiated by 2-bromopropionitrile (BPN) was controlled more effectively in toluene than in polar solvents. The rate of polymerization increased with increasing the polymerization temperature and the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 56.7 KJ mol(-1). In addition, reverse ATRP of MMA was able to be successfully carried out using AIBN in toluene at 80 degrees C. Polymerization of styrene (St) was found to be controlled well by using the PEBr/FeBr2/DPPMP system in DMF at 110 degrees C.

To investigate the development of osteoarthritis (OA) after transection of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy in mice in which genes encoding either interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE), stromelysin 1, or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were deleted.\n\nMethods. Sectioning of the medial collateral ligament and partial medial meniscectomy were performed on right knee joints of wild-type and, knockout mice. Left joints served as unoperated controls. Serial histologic sections were obtained from throughout the whole joint of both knees 4 days or 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after surgery. Sections were graded for OA lesions on a scale of 0-6 and were assessed for breakdown of tibial cartilage matrix proteoglycan (aggrecan) and type II collagen by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases with immunohistochemistry studies using anti-VDIPEN, anti-NITEGE, and CoI2-3/4C(short) neoepitope antibodies. Proteoglycan depletion was assessed by Alcian blue staining and chondrocyte cell death, with the TUNEL technique.\n\nResults. All knockout mice showed accelerated development of OA lesions in the medial tibial cartilage after surgery, compared with wild-type mice. ICE-iNOS-, and particularly IL-1beta-knockout mice developed OA lesions in the lateral cartilage of unoperated limbs. Development of focal histopathologic lesions was accompanied by increased levels of MMP-, aggrecanase-, and collagenase-generated cleavage neoepitopes in areas around lesions, while nonlesional areas showed no change in immunostaining. Extensive cell death was also detected by TUNEL staining in focal areas around lesions.\n\nConclusion. We postulate that deletion of each of these genes, which encode molecules capable of producing degenerative changes in cartilage, leads to changes in the homeostatic controls regulating the balance between anabolism and catabolism, favoring accelerated cartilage degeneration. These observations suggest that these genes may play important regulatory roles in maintaining normal homeostasis in articular cartilage matrix turnover.", "ISSN": "0004-3591", "pub": "ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM", "volume": "48", "authors": ["Clements, KM", "Price, JS", "Chambers, MG", "Visco, DM", "Poole, AR", "Mason, RM"], "issue": "12", "pages": "3452-3463"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/om00032a020", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861392520/orgnd7-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 1993", "title": "COBALT COMPLEXES WITH THE 1-[2-(N,N-DIMETHYLAMINO)ETHYL]-2,3,4,5-TETRAMETHYLCYCLO-PENTADIENYL LIGAND", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/om00032a020", "abstract": "Some new Co(I), Co(II), and Co(III) complexes containing the 1-[2-(NN-dimethylamino)-ethyl]-2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp(AND)) are described.

The Arabidopsis genome has a single copy of COI1, but the Oryza sativa genome has three closely related COI homologs. To examine the functions of the three OsCOIs, we used yeast two-hybrid assays to examine their interactions with JAZ proteins and found that OsCOIs interacted with OsJAZs and with JAZs, in a coronatine dependent manner. We also tested whether OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b could complement Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutants and found that overexpression of either gene in the coi1-1 mutant resulted in restoration of JA signal transduction and production of seeds, indicating successful complementation. Although OsCOI2 interacted with a few OsJAZs, we were not able to successfully complement the coi1-1 mutant with OsCOI2. Molecular modeling revealed that the three OsCOIs adopt 3D structures similar to COI1. Structural differences resulting from amino acid variations, especially among amino acid residues involved in the interaction with coronatine and JAZ proteins, were tested by mutation analysis. When His-391 in OsCOI2 was substituted with Tyr-391, OsCOI2 interacted with a wider range of JAZ proteins, including OsJAZ1, 2, 5 similar to 9 and 11, and complemented coi1-1 mutants at a higher frequency than the other OsCOIs and COI1.

We identified two Leu-rich repeat receptor-like kinases in Arabidopsis thaliana that play a role in regulating cell wall function. Mutations in these FEI1 and FEI2 genes (named for the Chinese word for fat) disrupt anisotropic expansion and the synthesis of cell wall polymers and act additively with inhibitors or mutations disrupting cellulose biosynthesis. While FEI1 is an active protein kinase, a kinase-inactive version of FEI1 was able to fully complement the fei1 fei2 mutant. The expansion defect in fei1 fei2 roots was suppressed by inhibition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, an enzyme that converts Ado-Met to ACC in ethylene biosynthesis, but not by disruption of the ethylene response pathway. Furthermore, the FEI proteins interact directly with ACC synthase.

A XANES method was used to determine I-2, I(V) and I (-I) in supernatant solutions and slurries of minerals, This is, we believe, the first reported use of XANES to investigate the redox state of I that is sorbed on minerals. With this technique, it was determined that pyrite, biotite and magnetite sorb I from solutions containing 1000 mu g ml(-1) I. In the pyrite/water system, IO3- was reduced to what appeared to be I-2 in the XANES scans and sorbed on the minerals surface. Magnetite sorbed I- from solution but not IO3-. In contrast, biotite sorbed IO3- from solution but did not take up any I-. No changes in I redox state were observed in the magnetite and biotite experiments. Based on this association the presence of Fe(II) in the sorbing phase appears to be related to uptake, but not necessarily to a change in I redox.\n\nResults of the XANES experiments, in which high concentrations of I were used, were corroborated for IO3- with pyrite, magnetite and biotite at very low concentrations of I-125. Most of the other minerals tested sorbed small fractions of the I-125 tracer, but this level of uptake could not be observed in XANES scans.\n\nTo examine the relationship between pyrite and IO3-, experiments were conducted in which concentrations of Fe, I, S2- and SO42- were determined in the aqueous phase of slurries containing pyrite. In the presence of I (starting as IO3-), concentrations of Fe in solution were significantly lower than without I, even at pH values sufficiently low that Fe should stay in solution. The XANES spectra indicate that I-2 is present on this material, eliminating the possibility of FeI2 formation where I is present as I-. The implication is that I-2, sorbed on the surface, inhibits release of Fe to solution (or promotes its precipitation)while S is oxidized to SO42- and released. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Previous work had described [HNiFe(pdt)(dppe)(CO)(3)](+) ([1H](+)) and its activity as a catalyst for the reduction of protons (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 14877). Work described in this paper focuses on the effects on properties of NiFe model complexes of the diphosphine attached to nickel as well as the dithiolate bridge, 1,3-propanedithiolate (pdt) vs 1,2-ethanedithiolate (edt). A new synthetic route to these Ni-Fe dithiolates is described, involving reaction of Ni(SR)(2)(diphosphine) with FeI2(CO)(4) followed by in situ reduction with cobaltocene. Evidence is presented that this route proceeds via a metastable mu-iodo derivative. Attempted isolation of such species led to the crystallization of NiFe(Me(2)pdt)(dppe)I-2, which features tetrahedral Fe(II) and square planar Ni(II) centers (H(2)Me(2)pdt = 2,2-dimethylpropanedithiol). The new tricarbonyls prepared in this work are NiFe(pdt)(dcpe)(CO)(3) (2, dcpe = 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane), NiFe(edt)(dppe)(CO)(3) (3), and NiFe(edt)(dcpe)(CO)(3) (4). Attempted preparation of a phenylthiolate-bridged complex via the FeI2(CO)(4) + Ni(SPh)(2)(dppe) route gave the tetrametallic species [(CO)(2)Fe(SPh)(2)Ni(CO))(2)(mu-dppe)(2). Crystallographic analysis of the edt-dcpe compund [2H]BF4 and the edt-dppe compound [3H]BF4 verified their close resemblance. Each features pseudo-octahedral Fe and square pyramidal Ni centers. Starting from [3H]BF4 we prepared the PPh3 derivative [HNiFe(edt)(dppe)(PPh3)(CO)(2)]BF4 ([5H]BF4), which was obtained as a similar to 2:1 mixture of unsymmetrical and symmetrical isomers. Acid-base measurements indicate that changing from Ni(dppe) (dppe = Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2) to Ni(dcpe) decreases the acidity of the cationic hydride complexes by 2.5 pK(a)(PhCN) units, from similar to 11 to similar to 13.5 (previous work showed that substitution at Fe leads to more dramatic effects). The redox potentials are more strongly affected by the change from dppe to dcpe, for example the [2](0/+) couple occurs at E-1/2 = -820 for [2](0/+) vs -574 mV (vs Fc(+/0)) for [1](0/+). Changes in the dithiolate do not affect the acidity or the reduction potentials of the hydrides. The acid-independent rate of reduction of CH2ClCO2H by [2H](+) is about 50 s(-1) (25 degrees C), twice that of [1H](+). The edt-dppe complex [2H](+) proved to be the most active catalyst, with an acid-independent rate of 300 s(-1).", "ISSN": "0020-1669", "pub": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "volume": "50", "authors": ["Carroll, ME", "Barton, BE", "Gray, DL", "Mack, AE", "Rauchfuss, TB"], "issue": "19", "pages": "9554-9563"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0020-1693(02)01304-X", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002016930201304X/pdfft?md5=4aee1a950f93a7eee5fcb2223b773edd&pid=1-s2.0-S002016930201304X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 20 2003", "title": "Synthesis and structural characterization of iron(II) derivatives of heterocyclic tridentate amines", "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0020-1693(02)01304-X", "abstract": "Compounds of general formula FeX2(L) {L=2,6-bis(3,5-dimethyl-N-pyrazolyl)pyridine, C15H17N5; bis[3,5-dimethyl-N-pyrazolyl)methyl]-isopropylamine, C15H25N5; bis(benzimidazol-2-yl-methyl)amine, C16H15N5, 1,3-bis(benzimidazolyl)propane, C17H16N4; bis(benzimidazolyl-2-methyl)ether, C16H14N4O; bis(benzimidazolyl-2-methyl)thioether, C16H14N4S} have been synthesized by reacting the amine with Fe4Cl8(THF)(6) or FeI2(CO)(4) in toluene.

Mucilage is synthesized during seed development within maternally derived seed coat mucilage secretory cells (MSCs), and is released to surround the seed upon imbibition. The FEI1/FEI2 receptor-like kinases and the SOS5 extracellular GPI-anchored protein were shown previously to act on a pathway that regulates the synthesis of cellulose in Arabidopsis roots. Here, we demonstrate that both FEI2 and SOS5 also play a role in the synthesis of seed mucilage. Disruption of FEI2 or SOS5 leads to a reduction in the rays of cellulose observed across the seed mucilage inner layer, which alters the structure of the mucilage in response to hydration. Mutations in CESA5, which disrupts an isoform of cellulose synthase involved in primary cell wall synthesis, result in a similar seed mucilage phenotype. The data indicate that CESA5-derived cellulose plays an important role in the synthesis and structure of seed coat mucilage and that the FEI2/SOS5 pathway plays a role in the regulation of cellulose synthesis in MSCs.

Systematic variation of the steric and electronic properties of the phosphinoamide phosphorus and nitrogen substituents leads to structurally different complexes. Reaction of [(PrNKPPh2)-Pr-i] (1) with MCl2 (M = Mn, Fe) affords the phosphinoamide-bridged bimetallic complexes [Mn-((PrNPPh2)-Pr-i)(3)Mn((PrNPPh2)-Pr-i)] (3) and [Fe((PrNPPh2)-Pr-i)(3)Fe-((PrNPPh2)-Pr-i)] (4). Complexes 3 and 4 are iso-structural, with one metal center preferentially binding to the three amide ligands in a trigonal planar arrangement while the second metal center is ligated by three phosphine donors. A fourth phosphinoamide ligand caps the tetrahedral coordination sphere of the phosphine-ligated metal center. Miissbauer spectroscopy of complex 4 suggests that the metals in these complexes are best described as Fe-II centers. In contrast, treatment of MnCl2 or.FeI2 with [MesNKP(i)Pr(2)] (2) leads to the formation of the halide-bridged species [(THF)Mn(mu-Cl)(MesNP(i)Pr(2))(2)Mn(MesNP(i)Pr(2))] (5) and [(THF)Fe(mu-I)(MesNP(i)Pr(2))(2)FeI (7), respectively. Utilization of FeCl2 in place of FeI2, however, leads exclusively to the C-3-symmetric complex [Fe(MesNP(i)Pr(2))(3)FeCl] (6), structurally similar to 4 but with a halide bound to the phosphine-ligatecl Fe center. The Mbssbauer spectrum of 6 is also consistent with high spin Fe\" centers. Thus, in the case of the [(PrNPPh2)-Pr-i](-) and [MesN13113r2] ligands, zwitterionic complexes with the two.metals in disparate coordination environments are preferentially formed. In the case of the more electron-rich ligand [(PrNPPr2)-Pr-i-Pr-i](-), complexes with a 2:1 mixed donor ligand arrangement, in which one of the ligand arms has reversed orientation relative to the previous examples, are formed exclusively when [(PrNLiP)-Pr-i'Pr2] (generated in situ) is treated with MC12 (M = Mn, Fe): (THF)3LiCI[Mn(N l'rFiPr2)2( P1Pr2/\\11Pr)MnCl] (8) and [Fe(NiPrPiPr2)2(PiPr2N'Pr)FeCI] (9).

The iodine uptake and corrosion on stainless steel surface was extensive at room temperature, particularly in air. The adsorbed iodine desorbed only during purging with air and not with N-2. This desorption behaviour and the extensive iodine-catalysed corrosion in air are explained by the reaction of oxygen with FeI2 to form iron oxyiodide (FeIxOy) solids, and by significant volume changes associated with the formation of FeI2 and FeIxOy.

A variable-temperature NMR study revealed a barrier of ca. 12 kcal mol(-1) for the rotation of the phenyl group.

Recently, hyperfine field, electric field gradient, and other local quantities at the Fe site were measured over a wide range of pressures indicating a collapse of the orbital magnetic moment below the insulator-to-metal transition. In the present work we apply local density approximation (LDA) and LDA+U approaches to calculate the electronic structure and to investigate the Fe on-site quantities. We propose that the vanishing of the orbital moment is connected to the change of orbital order as reflected in the symmetry of the occupied minority-spin orbital.

Five iron halides were used as the catalysts, it was found that the oxidation activity and the DMHB yield decreased in the order FeCl2 > FeBr3 > FeCl3 much greater than FeF2 > FeI2. The solvent had significant effect on the FeCl2 catalyst performances, but the solvent effect was opposite to that observed earlier for a CuCl2 catalyst. Among alcohols with 1-6 carbon numbers, methanol was the best solvent for FeCl2, but it was reported earlier to be the worst solvent for CuCl2. In the temperature range of 70-110degreesC, the maximum DMHB yield obtained with FeCl2 was around 75% (this yield was higher than that obtained with CuCl2), which occurred at the 2,4,6-TMP conversion of around 93%. Further increase of 2,4,6-TMP conversion resulted in the rapid increase of the by-product (2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, DMBQ), which suggested that most of the DMBQ came from the oxidation of the desired product. An electron transfer (from 2,4,6-TMP to iron (III)) mechanism involving the intermediacy of an aromatic radical cation was proposed for the oxidation of 2,4,6-TMP to DMHB. Based on the mechanism, the effects of solvents and halide ligands were explained. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The morphology of the surfaces turns out to be drastically altered for both oxidized and reduced crystals in comparison with the original stoichiometric surfaces. The observed changes on the surface of SrTiO3 due to the applied extensive thermal treatment cannot be explained by the formation of point defects, relaxation of the uppermost surface layer, rumpling, or reconstruction due to vacancy ordering. Instead, the results have to be interpreted in terms of segregation processes and solid-state reactions at elevated temperatures which cause the formation of new chemical phases on the surface and in the region underneath. On the surface of oxygen-annealed SrTiO3, this leads to the growth of steps perpendicular to the surface with step heights larger than the unit cell of the perovskite structure. Crystals prepared above 900 degrees C are shown to exhibit a step height of 11.8 Angstrom which is attributed to the formation of a Ruddlesden-Popper phase SrO*(SrTiO3)(n) with n = 1 on the surface. In the case of reduced crystals, the topographic changes on the surface are caused by the formation of Ti-rich phases such as TiO and Ti2O on the surface above 900 degrees C. The complex interplay of the processes at the surface for different temperatures, in particular its dependence on the details of the heat treatment, is discussed. The induced chemical heterogeneity on the surface and in the near-surface region are interpreted in terms of a kinetic demixing. The potential driving forces for this behavior are discussed.

The effects on optical properties of TiO2 films of the crystal structure and microstructural evolution at various oxidation temperatures were investigated. The Ti films transformed into single-phase rutile TiO2 at temperatures greater than or equal to 550 degrees C without going through an anatase-to-rutile transformation. Instead, an additional crystalline Ti2O phase was detected at 550 degrees C only. An increase in the oxidation temperatures ranging between 700 and 900 degrees C led to an increase in both the refractive index and absorption coefficient, but a decrease in the band gap energy (E-g). According to the coherent potential approximation model, the band gap evolution of the oxidized films was primarily attributed to the electronic disorder due to oxygen deficiency at a higher oxidation temperature rather than the presence of an amorphous component in the prepared films.

In the present work, a biocomposite was successfully fabricated from hydroxyapatite and titanium powders by powder metallurgy method. Bioactivity of the composite in a simulated body fluid (SBF) was investigated. Main crystal phases of the as-fabricated composite are found to be Ti2O, CaTiO3, CaO, alpha-Ti and a TiP-like phase. When the composite is immersed in the simulated body fluid for a certain time, a poor-crystallized, calcium-deficient, carbonate-containing apatite film will form on the surface of the composite. The time required to induce apatite nucleation is within 2 h. In addition, the apatite is also incorporated with a little magnesium and chlorine element. It is found that Ti2O has the ability to induce the formation of bone-like apatite in the SBF. And a dissolve of the CaO phase could also provide favorable conditions for the apatite formation, by forming open pores on the surface of the composite and increasing the degree of supersaturation of the SBF with respect to the apatite.

Recently, the Furong tin ore deposit was found in this stock, with a tin reserve of approximately 600,000 tons. The main rock-forming minerals including amphibole, biotite, plagioclase and ore minerals including cassiterite and rutile were analysed chemical compositions by electron microprobe. The biotite is Fe-rich annite, and has high Ti and Cl concentration. The biotite has high Fe3+/(Fe2++Fe3+) ratios and the oxygen fugacity calculated by biotite compositions is above Ni-NiO (NNO), and near the Fe2O3-Fe3O4 (MH). The amphiboles are ferropargasite and ferro-edenite homblende. The pressure of the granite estimated by Al-in-hornblende barometer is 3.6 +/- 0.9 kbar. An amphibole-plagioclase thermometry and a semiquantitative hornblende thermometer yield a forming temperature of 750 similar to 820 degrees C. The chlorite from the orebody has negligible K2O, Ti2O, F, and Cl, but shows similar Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratios with amphibole and biotite. Cassiterite is observed closely associated with rutile disseminated in chlorite alteration veins and envelopes. The ore-forming temperature is estimated to be 290 similar to 405 degrees C from chlorite geothermometry.\n\nThe Qitianling granite contains Sn-rich hornblende and biotite, and shows a high oxygen fugacity for the magma, which is slightly different from the common S-type stanniferous granites worldwide. Fractional crystallization of the magma and tin deposition directly from exsolved magmatic-hydrothermal fluids may not be the major mechanism for the tin mineralization in this deposit. Instead, we suggest that post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration of the granite may have released tin and other metals (e.g., Ti) from the Sn-bearing biotite and hornblende in the granite.

These orientations have smaller surface energy with respect to other ones and thus it is more probable to be the real terminations of the anatase and rutile nanocrystallites in the titania polycrystalline powders. Potentiometric titrations for obtaining \"fine structured\" titration curves as well as microelectrophoresis and streaming potential measurements have been performed.\n\nOn the basis of ab-initio calculations, and taking into account the relative contribution of each crystal face to the whole surface of the nanocrystals involved in the titania aggregates of a suspension, the three most probable surface ionization models have been derived. These models and the Music model are then tested in conjunction with the \"Stern-Gouy-Chapman\" and \"Basic Stern\" electrostatic models. The finally selected surface ionization model (model A) in combination with each one of the two electrostatic models describes very well the protonation/deprotonation behavior of titania. The description is also very good if this model is combined with the Three Plane (TP) model.\n\nThe application of the \"A/(TP)\" model allowed mapping the surface (hydr)oxo-groups [TiO(H) and Ti2O(H)] of titania exposed in aqueous solutions. At pH>pzc almost all terminal oxygens [TiO] are non-protonated whereas even at low pH values the non-protonated terminal oxygens predominate. The acid-base behavior of the bridging oxygens [Ti2O] is different. Thus, even at pH = 10 the greater portion of them is protonated. The application of the \"A/TP\" model in conjunction with potentiometric titrations, microelectrophoresis and streaming potential experiments allowed mapping the \"titania/electrolyte solution\" interface. It was found that the first (second) charged plane is located on the oxygen atoms of the first (second) water overlayer at a distance of 1.7 (3.4) angstrom from the surface. The region between the surface and the second plane is the compact layer. The region between the second plane and the shear plane is the stagnant diffuse part of the interface, with an ionic strength dependent width, ranging from 20 (0.01 M) up to 4 angstrom (0.3 M). The region between the shear plane and the bulk solution is the mobile diffuse part, with an ionic strength dependent width, ranging from 10 (0.01 M) up to 2 angstrom (0.3 M).\n\nAt I>0.017 M the mean concentration of the counter ions is higher in the stagnant than in the mobile part of the diffuse layer. For a given I, removal of pH from pzc brings about an increase of the mean concentration in the interfacial region and a displacement of the counter ions from the mobile to the stagnant part of the diffuse layer. The mean concentration of the counter ions in the compact layer is generally lower than the corresponding ones in the stagnant and mobile diffuse layers. The mobility of the counter ions in the stagnant layer decreases as pH draws away from pzc or ionic strength increases. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, titanium is also a very active getter. To characterize the gettering process, we have investigated the temperature dependence of stable oxides on titanium in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) using Auger electron spectroscopy, quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 600 degreesC. The surfaces of titanium specimens were prepared by electropolishing (EP), and a thin titanium oxide layer, principally TiO2, was formed on the surface at RT. On increasing the temperature to above 300 degreesC, the O-KLL Auger intensity began to decrease in a drastic way, while in contrast, the Ti-LMM Auger intensity was increased. Above 450 degreesC, no oxygen was detected on the titanium surface in UHV However, the outgassing rates of H2O, O-2, CO2 and CO2 from the surface did not show any changes in QMS measurements below 450 degreesC. This behavior is explained as gettering, which is an enhancement of diffusion of oxygen from the surface into the bulk. To investigate the temperature dependence of the chemical states of titanium oxides on an EP surface, XPS analysis was also performed in the same way in the range of 200-450 degreesC. The results showed drastic changes of the titanium oxide core XPS levels such that the TiO2 decomposed into suboxides at 180 degreesC, and even the remaining TiO2 was still decreasing on heating up to 420 degreesC. The surface oxide composition on titanium is very sensitive to the temperature.

The results of TiHx thermal oxidation investigation show that it is the presence of hydrogen in hydride phases which influence the dynamics of titanium hydride oxidation (Ti-x-->TiHx-yOz-->Ti2O-->TiO2). Unfortunately the heating of titanium hydride in air results in sample caking. Hence it is impossible to obtain the pure titanium dioxide by using this method. The oxidation of titanium hydride in the low temperature oxygen plasma of microwave and glow discharges was also investigated. It is shown that the process of titanium hydride oxidation in O2-plasma of a glow discharge continues step-by-step and as in the case of thermal TiHx oxidation is also accompanied by sample caking. The efficiency of the oxidation process depends on the temperature and the time of treatment. The action of a low temperature oxygen plasma of microwave discharge upon titanium hydride didn't cause sample caking and led to rutile formation. The probable reasons why TiHx effectively oxidizes solely to rutile in a microwave discharge are discussed.

As is known, electrode materials' with two-dimensional (2D) permeable channels, high-conductivity structural scaffolds, and high specific surface areas are the indispensible requirements for the development of in plane supercapacitors with superior performance, while it is difficult for the presently available inorganic materials to make the best in all aspects. In this sense, vanadium disulfide (VS2) presents an ideal material platform due to its synergic properties of metallic nature and exfoliative characteristic brought by the conducting S V S layers stacked up by weak van der Waals interlayer interactions, offering great potential as high performance M:plane supercapacitor electrodes. Herein, we developed a unique ammonia assisted Strategy to exfoliate bulk VS2 flakes into ultrathin VS2 nanosheets stacked With less than five S-L-V S single layers, representing a brand new two-dimensional material having metallic behavior aside from graphene. Moreover, highly conductive VS2 thin films were successfully assembled for constructing the electrodes of in plane supercapacitors. As is expected, a specific capacitance of 4760 mu F/cm(2) was realized here in a 150 nm in plane configuration, of which no obvious degradation was observed even after 1000 charge/discharge Odes, offering as a new in plane supercapacitor with high performance :based on quasi-two-dimensional materials", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "133", "authors": ["Feng, J", "Sun, X", "Wu, CZ", "Peng, LL", "Lin, CW", "Hu, SL", "Yang, JL", "Xie, Y"], "issue": "44", "pages": "17832-17838"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/nn204667z", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1406059433631/ancac3-masthead.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2012", "title": "Evidence of the Existence of Magnetism in Pristine VX2 Monolayers (X = S, Se) and Their Strain-Induced Tunable Magnetic Properties", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn204667z", "abstract": "First-principles calculations are performed to study the electronic and magnetic properties of VX2 monolayers (X = 5, Se).

Furthermore, interestingly, both the magnetic moments and strength of magnetic coupling increase rapidly with increasing Isotropic strain from -5% to 5% for VX2 monolayers. It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment Is related to the strong ionic covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions.

It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNA(ala), tRNA(ile) or tRNA(glu)), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

As distinctly different from other nanocrystals, we discovered that 2-D layered TMC nanocrystals are unstable in the presence of reactive radicals from elemental chalcogen during the crystal formation. We first introduce the synthesis of titanium sulfide and selenide where well-defined single crystallinity and lateral size controllability are verified, and then such synthetic protocols are extended to all of group IV and V transition-metal sulfide (TiS2, ZrS2, HfS2, VS2, NbS2, and TaS2) and selenide (TiSe2, ZrSe3, HfSe3, VSe2, NbSe2, and TaSe2) nanocrystals.

The distinguishing feature of the mantle in the subduction regions is the presence of hydrated phases, which transport water into the Earth's interior and release it with dramatic local consequences, triggering earthquakes and melting. The seismological detection of these hydrous phases and geo-dynamic interpretation of flow in the hydrous mantle depend on knowledge of the anisotropic elastic properties and the characteristics of the wave propagation in anisotropic media. In this paper we briefly recall the distinguishing features of anisotropic wave propagation and the observable parameters. We suggest the Vp/Vs ratio is a physically sound parameter than can be observed by seismology in anisotropic regions of the Earth, whereas the Poisson's ratio, which is often quoted, is not directly observable and does not correspond to the characteristics of wave propagation in an anisotropic or isotropic medium. We report for the first time the ratios of Vp/Vs1 and Vp/Vs2, where Vs1 is the fastest and Vs2 slowest S-wave velocities of an anisotropic media. We present the current knowledge of the anisotropic seismic properties of hydrous minerals in the upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle that are stable along low temperature geotherms associated with subduction, and identify which minerals are likely to influence seismological observations because they have very high volume fractions, or very high anisotropies, or both of these.\n\nIn the upper mantle antigorite and talc are exceptionally anisotropic (Vp 71% Vs 68% and Vp 65%, Vs 68%, respectively) and chlorite is also very anisotropic for S-waves (Vp 35%, Vs 76%). Comparatively less anisotropic are hornblende (Vp 27%, Vs 31%), used as proxy for tremolite in subduction zones, and clinohumite (21.8%, Vs 15.9%). Brucite at 4 GPa (Vp 26.5%, Vs 30.9%) and the dense hydrogen magnesium silicate (DHMS) phase A at 9GPa (Vp 9.3%, Vs 17.6%) are the only hydrous minerals stable in the upper mantle that have had their elastic properties measured at in situ mantle pressures. Except for the phase A, all these minerals are more anisotropic than olivine for at least one parameter (Vp, Vs, Vp/Vs1, or Vp/Vs2). In the transition zone the major phases hydrous wadsleyite and ringwoodite C have moderate to weak anisotropies (Vp 16.3%, Vs 16.5%, and Vp 1.9%, Vs 4.4%, respectively). The DHMS Superhydrous B has a moderate anisotropy (Vp 6.9%, Vs 11.6%). At greater depth the DHMS phase D Lit 24 GPa (Vp 10.8%, Vs 18.0%) is the only hydrous phase that can transport hydrogen from the transition zone into the lower mantle. The phase D is more anisotropic for S than P waves like many of the hydrous phases. From these data it is clear that hydrous phases are in general very anisotropic. However, pressure can play a strong role in reducing anisotropy. It is the case for brucite and talc, in which increasing pressure from ambient to 4 GPa reduces the anisotropy by about 50% for both P and S waves. In contrast, the anisotropy of the DHMS phase A does not change significantly with pressure.\n\nOur picture of the seismic anisotropy of hydrated minerals remains incomplete; the elastic properties of many have not been measured even at ambient conditions (e.g., 10 angstrom phase and phase E) or not measured in their true elastic symmetry (e.g., clinochlore). The majority of hydrous minerals have not been measured at high pressure. and none related to hydrated mantle have been measured at elevated temperature. We have shown in the few cases where hydrous minerals have been measured as a function of pressure, that this variable has an important effect oil the velocity distribution and in most cases reduces the degree of anisotropy, hence we Would expect seismic anisotropy to play a key role in the determination of the shallow structure of subduction zones in the upper mantle.", "ISSN": "1863-4621", "pub": "SUBDUCTION ZONE GEODYNAMICS", "volume": "N/A", "authors": ["Mainprice, D", "Ildefonse, B"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "63-84"}, {"DOI": "10.1002/anie.200461326", "pdflink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3773/homepage/2002_mostfreqauth_62-08.pdf", "pubDate": "2005", "title": "\nVS2 nanotubes containing organic-amine templates from the NT-VOx precursors and reversible copper intercalation in NT-VS2\n", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200461326/abstract;jsessionid=13D7AB638FEA9F33EB9CBA9C9B880A24.f04t02", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "1433-7851", "pub": "ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION", "volume": "44", "authors": ["Therese, HA", "Rocker, F", "Reiber, A", "Li, JX", "Stepputat, M", "Glasser, G", "Kolb, U", "Tremel, W"], "issue": "2", "pages": "262-265"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/sj.ijo.0801572", "pdflink": "http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n4/pdf/0801572a.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 2001", "title": "Compared with nibbling, neither gorging nor a morning fast affect short-term energy balance in obese patients in a chamber calorimeter", "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n4/full/0801572a.html", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test if a diet of 4.2 MJ/24 h as six isocaloric meals would result in a lower subsequent energy intake, or greater energy output than (a) 4.2 MJ/24 h as two isocaloric meals or (b) a morning fast followed by free access to food.\n\nDESIGN: Subjects were confined to the Metabolic Unit from 19:00 h on day 1 to 09:30 h on day 6. Each day they had a fixed diet providing 4.2 MJ with three pairs of meal patterns which were offered in random sequence. They were: six meals vs two meals without access to additional foods (6vs2), or six meals vs 2 meals with access to additional food (6+vs2+), or six meals vs four meals (6+vsAMFAST). In the AMFAST condition the first two meals of the day were omitted to reduce daily intake to 2.8 Mj and to create a morning fast, but additional food was accessible thereafter. Patients were confined in the chamber calorimeter from 19:00 h on day 2 until 09:00 h on day 4, and then from 19:00 h on day 4 to 09:00 h on day 6. The order in which each meal pattern was offered was balanced over time.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: Energy expenditure (chamber calorimetry), spontaneous activity (video) and energy intake (where additional foods were available) during the final 24 h of each dietary component. SUBJECTS: Ten (6vs2), eight (6+vs2+) and eight (6+vsAMFAST) women were recruited who had a BMI of greater than 25 kg,/m(2). RESULTS: From experiment 6vs2 the difference between energy expenditure with six meals (10.00 Mj) and two meals (9.96 MJ) was not significant (P= 0.88). Energy expenditure between 23:00 h and 08:00 h ('night') was, however, significantly higher (P= 0.02) with two meals (9.12 MJ/24 h) compared with six meals (8.34 MJ/24 h). The pattern of spontaneous physical activity did not differ significantly between these two meal patterns (P > 0.05). Total energy intake was affected by neither meal frequency in experiment 6+vs2+ (10.75MJ with six, 11.08M] with two; P=0.58) nor a morning fast in experiment 6+vsAMFAST (8.55 MJ/24 h with six, 7.60 MJ with AMFAST; P= 0.40). The total diet of subjects who had a morning fast tended to have a lower percentage of total energy from carbohydrate (40%) than when they had six meals per 24 h (49%) (P=0.05). Subsequent energy balance was affected by neither meal frequency (6vs2; P=0.88, 6+vs2+; P=0.50) nor a morning fast (P= 0.18).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In the short term, meal frequency and a period of fasting have no major impact on energy intake or expenditure but energy expenditure is delayed with a lower meal frequency compared with a higher meal frequency. This might be attributed to the thermogenic effect of food continuing into the night when a later, larger meal is given. A morning fast resulted in a diet which tended to have a lower percentage of energy from carbohydrate than with no fast.", "ISSN": "0307-0565", "pub": "INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY", "volume": "25", "authors": ["Taylor, MA", "Garrow, JS"], "issue": "4", "pages": "519-528"}, {"DOI": "10.1084/jem.147.4.1078", "pdflink": "http://jem.rupress.org/content/147/4/1078.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "1978", "title": "ACUTE PHASE REACTANTS CERULOPLASMIN AND HAPTOGLOBIN AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PLASMA PROSTAGLANDINS IN RABBITS BEARING VX2 CARCINOMA", "DOIlink": "http://jem.rupress.org/content/147/4/1078", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-1007", "pub": "JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE", "volume": "147", "authors": ["VOELKEL, EF", "LEVINE, L", "ALPER, CA", "TASHJIAN, AH"], "issue": "4", "pages": "1078-1088"}, {"DOI": "10.1086/519072", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/134/2/787/pdf/1538-3881_134_2_787.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 2007", "title": "Light curves of dwarf plutonian planets and other large kuiper belt objects: Their rotations, phase functions, and absolute magnitudes", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/134/2/787/", "abstract": "I report new time-resolved light curves and determine the rotations and phase functions of several large Kuiper Belt objects, which includes the dwarf planet Eris (2003 UB313).

All blastocysts were stored in OS. The embryos were recovered and transferred to Day 4 and 5 pseudopregnant recipients (for Day 5 and 6 blastocysts, respectively). Of the five recipients receiving peri-hatching blastocysts, two became pregnant and delivered a total of eight piglets. All three recipients of early blastocysts vitrified in VS1 had a delayed return to estrus; while of the four receiving embryos vitrified with VS2, two were delayed in returning to estrus, and one was confirmed pregnant after 45 days. A litter of five piglets, one male and four female, was produced at 116 days of gestation.

In this paper we determine the single crystal elastic constants at pressures from 0 to 12 GPa of talc triclinic(C (1) over bar) and monoclinic(C2/c) polytypes using ab initio methods. We find that talc has an extraordinarily high elastic anisotropy at zero pressure that reduces with increasing pressure. The exceptional anisotropy is complemented by a negative Poisson's ratio for many directions in crystal space. Calculations show that talc is not only one of very few common minerals to exhibit auxetic behaviour, but the magnitude of this effect may be the largest reported so far for a mineral. The compression (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocity anisotropy is 80% and 85% for the triclinic polytype. At pressures where talc is known be stable in the Earth (up to 5 GPa) the Vp and Vs anisotropy is reduced to about 40% for both velocities, which is still a very high value. Vp is slow parallel to the c-axis and fast perpendicular to it. This remains unchanged with increasing pressure and is observed in both polytypes. The shear wave splitting (difference between fast and slow S-wave velocities) at low pressure has high values in the plane normal to the c-axis, with a maximum near the a*-axis in the triclinic and the b-axis in the monoclinic polytype. The c-axis is the direction of minimum splitting. The pattern of shear wave splitting does not change significantly with pressure. The volume fraction of talc varies between 11 and 41% for hydrated mantle rocks, but the lack of data on the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) precludes a detailed analysis of the impact of talc on seismic anisotropy in subduction zones. However, it is highly likely that CPO can easily develop in zones of deformation due to the platy habit of talc crystals. For random aggregates of talc, the isotropic Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs ratio have significantly lower values than those of antigorite and may explain low-velocity regions in the mantle wedge. Vp/Vs ratios are more complex in anisatropic media because there are fast and slow S-waves, resulting in Vp/Vs1 and Vp/Vs2 ratios for every propagation direction, making interpretation difficult in deformed polycrystalline talc with a CPO. Talc on the subduction plate boundary can strongly influence guided wave velocity as CPO would develop in this region of intense shearing. The very low coefficient of friction (<0.1) of talc above 100 degrees C could also explain silent earthquakes at shallow depths (ca 30 km) along the subduction plate boundaries, frequently responsible for tsunami.

Our results show that H1 and H2 cells are sensitive to vertical motion, too. Their response depended on the position of the vertically moving stimuli within their receptive field. Stimulation within the frontal receptive field produced an asymmetric response: upward motion left the H1/H2 spike frequency nearly unaltered while downward motion increased the spike frequency to about 40% of their maximum responses to horizontal motion. In the lateral parts of their receptive fields, no such asymmetry in the responses to vertical image motion was found. Since downward motion is known to be the preferred direction of neurons of the vertical system in the lobula plate, we analyzed possible interactions between vertical system cells and H1 and H2 cells. Depolarizing current injection into the most frontal vertical system cell (VS1) led to an increased spike frequency, hyperpolarizing current injection to a decreased spike frequency in both H1 and H2 cells. Apart from VS1, no other vertical system cell (VS2-8) had any detectable influence on either H1 or H2 cells.

The results reveal that the relative stability between different phases is greatly affected by the thickness of the layers and the temperature. Below room temperature, both bulk and monolayer VS2 prefer to exhibit the hexagonal (H) structure instead of the trigonal (T) structure. Interestingly, at room temperature, although the H monolayer VS2 remains more stable than the T-VS2, the bulk T-VS2 becomes more stable than H-VS2. These results reveal that a phase transition between H and T will occur on changing either the thickness of the slab or the temperature. Furthermore, the different crystal structures (H and T) exhibit significantly distinct magnetism: the bulk T-VS2 has the lowest magnetism (0.31 mu(B)), while the monolayer H-VS2 has the largest magnetism (about 1.00 mu(B)) among the structures. Most importantly, our results reveal that the magnetism will increase sharply on the exfoliation of monolayer VS2 from the bulk at room temperature because of the phase transition from T to H.

The velocity measurements include compressional (Vp) and shear wave velocities (Vs1, Vs2) propagating in three orthogonal directions which were in general not parallel to inherent rock symmetry axes or planes. The measurements are accompanied by 3D-velocities calculations based on lattice preferred orientation (LPO) obtained by TOF (Time Of Flight) neutron diffraction analysis which allows the investigation of bulk volumes up to several cubic centimetres due to the high penetration depth of neutrons. The LPO-based numerical velocity calculations give important information on the different contribution of the various rock-forming minerals to bulk elastic anisotropy and on the relations of seismic anisotropy, shear wave splitting, and shear wave polarization to the structural reference frame (foliation and lineation). Comparison with measured velocities obtained for the three propagation directions that were not in accordance with the structural frame of the rocks (foliation and lineation) demonstrate that for shear waves propagating through anisotropic rocks the vibration directions are as important as the propagation directions. The study demonstrates that proper measurement of shear wave splitting by means of two orthogonal polarized sending and receiving shear wave transducers is only possible when their propagation and polarization directions are parallel and normal to foliation and lineation, respectively.

In the present study, a recently developed test, based on a recombinant fragment of the pollymorphic outer membrane protein POMP90 (rOMP90-4 indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [iELISAI) and one based on the variable segment 2 (VS2) region of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) (MOMP VS2 iELISA) were compared using sera from C. abortus-infected ewes at different stages throughout pregnancy. The rOMP90 iELISA detected antibody much earlier in pregnancy than the MOMP iELISA, which, like the complement fixation test, detected antibody only at the time of abortion or lambing. No anti-MOMP antibody response could be detected in three of seven experimentally infected ewes. Furthermore, the rOMP90 iELISA detected antibody in an animal that seroconverted during the course of the study, which the MOMP iELISA failed to detect. Overall, the results show that the rOMP90-4 iELISA is considerably more sensitive than the MOMP VS2 iELISA for identifying animals infected with C. abortus.

Fifteen male subjects walked on a treadmill at 0.83 (VS1) and 1.16 m s(-1) (VS2) and then at two similar velocities (V-Sim27 and V-Sim37) determined from two fractions of the N-Fr (0.27 and 0.37) so that the average group velocity remained unchanged in both conditions (VS1 = (V) over bar (Sim27) and VS2 = (V) over bar (Sim37)). N-Fr can theoretically be used to determine walking velocities proportional to leg lengths and to establish dynamic similarities between subjects. This study represents the first attempt at using this approach to examine plantar pressure. The ankle and knee joint angles were studied in the sagittal plane and the plantar pressure distribution was assessed with an in-shoe measurement device. The similarity ratios were computed from anthropometric parameters and plantar pressure peaks. Dynamically similar conditions caused a 25% reduction in leg joint angles variation and a 10% significant decrease in dimensionless pressure peak variability on average of five footprint locations. It also lead to heel and under-midfoot pressure peaks proportional to body mass and to an increase in the number of under-forefoot plantar pressure peaks proportional to body mass and/or leg length. The use of walking velocities derived from N-Fr allows kinematic and plantar pressure similarities between subjects to be observed and leads to a lower inter-subject variability.\n\nIn-shoe pressure measurements have proven to be valuable for the understanding of lower extremity function. Set walking velocities used for clinical assessment mask the effects of body size and individual gait mechanics. The anthropometric scaling of walking velocities (fraction of N-Fr) should improve identification of unique walking strategies and pathological foot functions. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Eleven serovar-specific probes to serovars A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, and 3 group-specific probes to group B (B, Ba, D, E, L1, and L2), group C (A, C, H, I, J, K, and L3), and an intermediate group (F and G) were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membrane. Two pairs of universal primers were designed for the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the VS1-VS2 gene. Digoxigenin-labeled amplicons of the VS1-VS2 gene of C trachomatis were hybridized to the membrane array. Hybridization signals were read by the nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate color development. The assay developed was tested with reference strains of C. trachomatis serovars and clinical samples. The sensitivity was evaluated for 57 samples previously found to be positive for C trachomatis by using plasmid PCR, and 98.2% (56/57) concordance was obtained. Fourteen oligonucleotide probes were optimized by trying different reaction conditions, showing specific hybridization with the corresponding reference strains, but no cross-reactions with other urogenital microorganisms. Using this procedure, a total of 59 strains were detected from 56 chlamydial samples. Eight genotypes were found, and type D, E, F, and H were the most frequently observed types (77.9%). Three cases (5.4%) had multiple infections with serovars: 1.D/E, 2.D/F, and 3.F/K. To validate the reference strains and confirm the genotype identity as determined by the oligonucleoticle array technology, we sequenced all reference strains and 10 selected specimens across variable sequence VS1 and VS2. No discrepancies were found between the array typing and the genotype identity confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product. The findings from this study indicated that the oligonucleotide array is a simple, fast, and specific assay for directly detecting and genotyping C. trachomatis from clinical samples.

The area under the receiver operator curve was calculated to be 0.824 (P < 0.001). In a further independent dataset of stage I NSCLC patients and healthy controls the AUC was 0.977 (P < 0.001). Specificity of the classifier was validated by permutation analysis in both validation cohorts. Genes within the classifier are enriched in immune-associated genes and show specificity for NSCLC.\n\nConclusions: Our results show that gene expression profiles of whole blood allow for detection of manifest NSCLC. These results prompt further development of gene expression-based biomarker tests in peripheral blood for the diagnosis and early detection of NSCLC. Clin Cancer Res; 17(10); 3360-7.

Studied veins (VSI, VS2, VS3) pertain to three distinct generations of folds (F-1, F-2, F-3) that formed during the retrograde metamorphic evolution. Two types of fluids characterize the different generations of veins and are represented essentially by aqueo-carbonic mixtures of moderate salinity with decreasing densities (1.01-0.41 g/cm(3)). The chemical evolution is characterised by a progressive decrease of H2O, from early fluids associated with opening of VS1 and VS2 (XCO(2)approximate to 0.08) to fluids related to VS3 formation (XCO(2)approximate to 0.3). The close match between the fluids in VS1 and VS3 suggests that the development of two superimposed systems of folds (F-1 and F-2 folds) occurs under very similar P-T conditions, during a progressive and continuous deformational event at glaucophanic and/or barroisitic metamorphic grade. A different evolution is outlined for the formation of VS3 during low green schist grade. Successive isochores allow us to define a retrograde decompression path for the Voltri Group. Present results indicate that fluid inclusions are powerful markers to constrain the P-T-I conditions of different folding events. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We observed that the low-hemolytic peptides could irreversibly inhibit the growth of various Candida species and multidrug resistance strains at MIC(80) values ranging from 15.62 mu M to 250 mu M. Synergy experiments showed that MIC(80) of the peptides was drastically reduced in combination with an antifungal drug fluconazole. The dye PI uptake assay was used to demonstrate peptide induced cell membrane permeabilization. Intracellular localization of the FITC-labeled peptides in Candida albicans was studied by confocal microscopy and FACS. Killing kinetics, PI uptake assay, and the intracellular presence of FITC-peptides suggested that growth inhibition is not solely a consequence of increased membrane permeabilization. We showed that entry of the peptide in Candida cells resulted in accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to cell necrosis. Morphological alteration in Candida cells caused by the peptides was visualized by electron microscopy. We propose that de novo designed VS2 and VS3 peptides have multiple detrimental effects on target fungi, which ultimately result in cell wall disruption and killing. Therefore, these peptides represent a good template for further design and development as antifungal agents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The different mechanisms on the triplet and singlet surfaces have been identified. It is found that the 2 S-transfer reaction proceeds via two parallel reaction paths (path A and B) yielding two isomer products (VS2+-1 and VS2+-2, 2 2 respectively), and the exothermicity with endothermic feature of the formation of VS+ observed experimentally can be attributed to these two 2 reaction paths with the calculation reaction heats of -20.5 and 70.5 kJ/mol, respectively, on the ground triplet surface. The larger barrier (103.6 kJ/mol) of the O/S exchange reaction and the smaller probability of the formation of its preceding intermediate ((3)IM1) indicate the much less efficiency of the reaction, which is in agreement with the experimental observation.

It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment Is related to the strong ionic covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions.

The structural data deduced from x-ray diffraction pattern shows that the sample has the same structure as 2H-TaS2. A series of crystals with different superconducting transition temperatures (T-c) ranging from 2.5 K to 4.4 K were obtained. It is found that the T-c rises with the increase of Na content determined by energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis(EDX) of scanning electron microscope (SEM) on these crystals. Compared with the resistivity curve of un-intercalated sample 2H-TaS2 (T-c=0.8 K, T-CDW approximate to 70 K), no signal of charge density wave (CDW) was observed in samples Na0.1TaS2 and Na0.05TaS2. However, in some samples with lower T-c, the CDW appears again at about 65 K. Comparison between the anisotropic resistivity indicates that the anisotropy becomes smaller in samples with more Na intercalation (albeit a weak semiconducting behavior along c-axis) and thus higher T-c. It is thus concluded that there is a competition between the superconductivity and the CDW. With the increase of sodium content, the rise of T-c in NaxTaS2 is caused mainly by the suppression to the CDW in 2H-TaS2, and the conventional rigid band model for layered dichalcogenide may be inadequate to explain the changes induced by the slight intercalation of sodium in 2H-TaS2.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "72", "authors": ["Fang, L", "Wang, Y", "Zou, PY", "Tang, L", "Xu, Z", "Chen, H", "Dong, C", "Shan, L", "Wen, HH"], "issue": "1", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.61.4994", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 15 2000", "title": "Three-dimensional unoccupied band structure of graphite: Very-low-energy electron diffraction and band calculations", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.61.4994", "abstract": "The unoccupied band structure of single-crystal graphite above the vacuum level is studied by very-low-energy electron diffraction.

As distinctly different from other nanocrystals, we discovered that 2-D layered TMC nanocrystals are unstable in the presence of reactive radicals from elemental chalcogen during the crystal formation. We first introduce the synthesis of titanium sulfide and selenide where well-defined single crystallinity and lateral size controllability are verified, and then such synthetic protocols are extended to all of group IV and V transition-metal sulfide (TiS2, ZrS2, HfS2, VS2, NbS2, and TaS2) and selenide (TiSe2, ZrSe3, HfSe3, VSe2, NbSe2, and TaSe2) nanocrystals.

The intercalation compounds were prepared in situ by deposition of Na, K, and Ca on VSe2 cleavage surfaces. The intercalation was monitored by core-level spectroscopy, and although K was found to intercalate more slowly than Na and Cs, estimated alkali concentrations of x = 0.2-0.3 were reached for all three alkali metals. Additional depositions mainly seemed to increase the intercalation depth. Good agreement between LAPW calculations and valence-band spectra was found, in particular for the dispersion along the layers. Normal-emission spectra, obtained at different photon energies, indicated vanishing perpendicular dispersion, but in spectra measured under variation of the emission angle some band-edge signatures were seen, which suggests that some perpendicular dispersion remains, in accordance with the LAPW calculations. The lack of dispersion in the normal-emission spectra could be due to intercalation induced structural transformations, leading to stacking disorder. Also correlation effects may contribute. The rigid-band model is found inadequate, except as a crude approximation, for describing the changes during the initial phase of intercalation. It might be used to describe the continued intercalation, however, under condition that the intercalation modified bands are used.

A broad feature centred at about 8 eV, and showing an onset at about 6 eV, is associated with higher-lying s/p bands while a weak peak at about 5 eV, which shows no dispersion along GAMMA-A, is tentatively identified as a surface resonance.

Transmission and scanning electron microscopy combined with scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy have been used to characterize the arrangements, structure and dimensions of the nanostructures and the substrate before metal deposition. On the flat parts of the substrate, self-similar nanowire networks form with wire diameters ranging from 8 to 250 nm and mesh dimensions ranging from 0.35 to 10 mum. The nanowires are preferentially aligned along low-index crystal directions and possess polycrystalline structure. Nanoclusters are formed within the meshes of the nanowire network.

In this article, we discuss the ARPES technique applied to three quasi-low-D inorganic metals: a paradigm Fermi liquid (ni) material TiTe2, a well-known quasi-1D charge density wave (CDW) material K0.3MoO3 and a quasi-1D non-CDW material Li0.9Mo6O17. With TiTe2, we establish that a many body theoretical interpretation of the ARPES line shape is possible. We also address the fundamental question of how to accurately determine the k(F) value from ARPES. Both K0.3MoO3 and Li0.9Mo6O17 show quasi-1D electronic structures with non-FL line shapes, A CDW gap opening is observed for K0.3MoO3, whereas no gap is observed for Li0.9Mo6O17. We show, however, that the standard CDW theory, even with strong fluctuations, is not sufficient to describe the non-FL line shapes of K0.3MoO3. We argue that a Luttinger liquid (LL) model is relevant for both bronzes, but also point out difficulties encountered in comparing data with theory. We interpret this situation to mean that a more complete and realistic theory is necessary to understand these data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We find an overall good correspondence between experiment and theory, with ail ARPES structures accounted for by the: calculated band structure. Particular focus is applied to the bands near the Fermi level and to the Fermi-surface topology. Interesting behavior is observed for an essentially Ti 3d(z)2-derived conduction band, whose measured Fermi vector and qualitative shape are excellently reproduced by the calculation.

At low temperatures, a widely held belief is that the CDW competes with another collective electronic state, superconductivity. But despite much exploration, a detailed study of this competition is lacking. Here we report how, on controlled intercalation of TiSe2 with Cu to yield CuxTiSe2, the CDW transition can be continuously suppressed, and a new superconducting state emerges near x=0.04, with a maximum transition temperature T-c of 4.15 K at x=0.08.

Analogies between the two concepts and their complementary nature were examined. The concept of hidden Fermi surface nesting was used to explain the d-electron-count dependence of the structural modulations of the 1T-MX2 layers containing d4/3, d2, and d3 ions on the basis of their hidden one-dimensional Fermi surfaces. The latter are derived from the observations that these layers are made up of three different sets of edge-sharing octahedral chains and that strong sigma-bonding interactions between the t2g orbitals occur along each chain direction. From the viewpoint of local chemical bonding, the driving force for the diamond-chain formation in the d3 systems and the zigzag-chain formation in the d2 systems is two-center, two-electron sigma-bonding, but that for the ribbon-chain formation in the d4/3 SyStems is three-center, two-electron sigma-bonding. Several structural modulations of 1T-MX2 and 2H-MX2 layers, difficult to understand in terms of Fermi surface nesting, were examined by performing molecular orbital and tight-binding band electronic structure calculations. The square-root 13 X square-root 13 modulation of a d1 1T-MX2 layer is described as a superposition of linear, multicenter sigma-bonding interactions which occur in three different directions around metal atoms. The 2 x 2 modulation of 1T-TiSe2 results from a second-order Jahn-Teller instability of the TiSe6 octahedra with d0 ions. The 3 x 3 modulation of a d1 2H-MX2 layer occurs to enhance the extent of the metal-metal bonding interactions between adjacent MX6 trigonal prisms. Structural modulations arising from Fermi surface nesting in low-dimensional metals are equivalent in nature to first-order Jahn-Teller distortions of molecules. Structural modulations of low-dimensional metals do not always originate from Fermi surface nesting, just as not all molecular distortions are caused by first-order Jahn-Teller distortions.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "114", "authors": ["WHANGBO, MH", "CANADELL, E"], "issue": "24", "pages": "9587-9600"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.21.615", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "1980", "title": "ANGLE-RESOLVED PHOTOEMISSION-STUDIES OF THE BAND-STRUCTURE OF TISE2 AND TIS2", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.21.615", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "21", "authors": ["CHEN, CH", "FABIAN, W", "BROWN, FC", "WOO, KC", "DAVIES, B", "DELONG, B", "THOMPSON, AH"], "issue": "2", "pages": "615-624"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.9.481", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "1974", "title": "ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE AND OPTICAL-PROPERTIES OF LAYERED DICHALCOGENIDES - TIS2 AND TISE2\n", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.9.481", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "9", "authors": ["MYRON, HW", "FREEMAN, AJ"], "issue": "2", "pages": "481-486"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.146403", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 5 2007", "title": "Evidence for an excitonic insulator phase in 1T-TiSe2\n", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.146403", "abstract": "We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of 1T-TiSe2 in both its room-temperature, normal phase and its low-temperature, charge-density wave phase.

The basic models behind charge-density-wave formation in low-dimensional solids are recapitulated, the experimental and theoretical results for the three selected compounds are reviewed, and their band structures and spectral weight distributions in the commensurate charge-density-wave phases are calculated using an empirical tight-binding model.

We propose a representation of the crystal density that is free from unphysical computational parameters specific to the: representation of the wave functions. The valence density is divided into two parts, one of which is expanded in a Fourier series and the other one is localized within small spheres surrounding the nuclei. It is shown that to a good approximation the latter part can be represented by its Y-00 component.

The Li-ion storage capacities are found to strongly depend on the nature of the surface functional groups, with O groups exhibiting the highest theoretical Li-ion storage capacities. MXene surfaces can be initially covered with OH groups, removable by high-temperature treatment or by reactions in the first lithiation cycle. This was verified by annealing f-Nb2C and f-Ti3C2 at 673 and 773 K in vacuum for 40 h and in situ X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Li capacity measurements for the first lithiation/delithiation cycle of f-Ti3C2. The high-temperature removal of water and OH was confirmed using X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. The voltage profile and X-ray adsorption near edge structure of f-Ti3C2 revealed surface reactions in the first lithiation cycle.

In the present study, the growth kinetics of niobium carbide layer deposited by thermo-reactive diffusion techniques in a solid medium on steel samples was reported. Niobium carbide coating treatment was performed on AISI 1040 steels in the powder mixture consisting of ferro-niobium, ammonium chloride and alumina at 1073, 1173 and 1273 K for 1-4 h. The presence of NbC and Nb2C phases formed on the surface of the steel substrates was confirmed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analyses. Niobium carbide layer thickness ranges from 3.42 +/- 0.52 to 11.78 +/- 2.29 mum depending upon the treatment time and temperature. Layer growth kinetics was analyzed by measuring the depth of niobium carbide layer as a function of time and temperature. The kinetics of niobium carbide coating by pack method shows a parabolic relationship between carbide layer thickness and treatment time, and the activation energy for the process is estimated to be 91.257 kJ mol(-1). Moreover, an attempt was made to investigate the possibility of predicting the contour diagram of niobium carbide layer variation and to establish some empirical relationships between process parameters and niobium carbide layer thickness.

It is found that this reaction is very similar to the conventional self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) process, but the ignition of the reaction is identified to be the mechanical collisions instead of heating the materials. Analysis of the products reveals that the final products of the Ti-C system are in good agreement with the equilibrium phase diagram, showing less relation with the alloying process. The decrease of the C content shortens the milling time prior to the SHS reaction of TiC by promoting the intimate mixing of the components, but lowers the heat release of the reaction and makes the propagation of the reaction more slowly. The SHS reaction during the mechanical alloying of the Nb-C system shows little difference, but the decrease of the C content can hardly influence the milling time prior to the reaction. By lowering the heat release of the SHS reaction of NbC, it lowers the reaction propagating rate. Mechanical alloying Nb50C50 and Nb55C45 results in the formation of NbC, while mechanical alloying Nb60C40 results in NbC + Nb instead of NbC + Nb2C according to the phase diagram. It was attributed to the fact that the rapid SHS reaction favors the formation of NbC, but hinders the occurrence of Nb2C phase through slow diffusion between NbC and the residual Nb. The measurement of the lattice parameters of TiC and NbC for different composition affirms the observed results.

The effects of substrate bias voltage (V-b) and methane flow rate (F-CH4) on the phase structure, composition, morphology, mechanical properties and tribological behavior for NbC films have been explored. For the film grown at F-CH4 = 6 sccm, a phase transition from a mixture of hexagonal-Nb2C and cubic-NbC phases to cubic-NbC phase occurs with increasing the absolute value of V-b and no C-C bonding appears. In contrast, for the film deposited at F-CH4 = 16 sccm, only the cubic-NbC phase is observed with increasing the absolute value of V-b and the C-C bonding appears. If F-CH4 is fixed at either 6 or 16 sccm, as the absolute value of V-b is increased, the growing film surface becomes smoother, and the compressive stress increases. This can be attributed to the increase in the carbon ion bombarding energy, which leads to promoting the diffusion of adsorbed atoms and more carbon species' occupying the interstitial positions. It is found that the hardness (H) increases first, and then decreases after reaching a maximum value with increasing the absolute value of V-b. The friction coefficient for the film obtained at F-CH4 = 16 sccm is lower than that at F-CH4 = 6 sccm, which may be ascribed to the presence of either graphite or amorphous carbon in the film grown at F-CH4 = 16 sccm. Furthermore, a high stress results in a poor wear resistance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The degradation in coating effect of Pd at elevated temperatures was substantially mitigated by Nb2C layer. Such improved durability was ascribed to retardation of open porosity development by Nb2C caused as a consequence of impeded interdiffusion between Pd and Nb.

With increasing F-CH4 from 4 to 22 sccm, the carbon content for the film increases from 32.7 to 68.7 at.% gradually, accompanying with a phase transition from hexagonal-Nb2C to cubic-NbC, and at the highest carbon content, the film exhibits a typical nanocomposite structure consisting of NbC nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous hydrocarbon (a-C:H) matrix. The morphology, mechanical properties and tribological behavior for the films exhibit a significant dependency on the amount of the amorphous carbon in the nanocomposite structure. The film surface becomes smooth with increasing the carbon content, corresponding to a transition from columnar crystallites to free of columnar features. In addition, the increase in carbon content for the films leads to an increase in the compressive stress for the well-crystallized film, but the excessive amorphous phase partially relaxes the stress. The NbCx film with 53.9 at.% carbon content shows the maximum hardness 25.0 GPa. Both friction coefficient and wear resistance are improved by increasing the content of the surplus amorphous carbon.

NbC and precipitated TiC produced by dissolved NbC reacted with Ti dispersed in the matrix. The microstructure of the cross-section of the overlayer (from surface to base metal), which was composed of alpha-Ti, can be separated into three layers: an upper overlayer with TiC, a middle overlayer with TiC and NbC, and a lower overlayer (interfacial layer and heat affected zone, HAZ). Due to solidification beginning at the interface and the effect of dilution, the TiC in the interfacial layer was finer. Owing to faster solidification under low-current conditions, the TiC particles were finer than under high-current conditions. Also, dendritic TiC under a low-current in the upper overlayer was also finer than under a high-current. Meanwhile, TiC precipitate that resulted from heterogeneous nucleation and Gibbs' free energy was also found around NbC. This NbC diffusion layer between TiC and NbC may have been beta Nb2C phase.

The field of NbC carbide extends from 41.7 to 56.6 at %. At a concentration above 50 at % C, the carbon phase in the coating is not revealed, which is probably caused by difficulties detecting it via X-ray diffraction method. Upon cryogenic tests, a change in the polarity of conductivity from metallic to semiconductor type upon an increase in the carbon concentration has been demonstrated.

The oxidation resistance improves with increasing the Ti due to the element diffuses toward the reaction interface and reacts with oxygen primarily and this causes the decreasing of solubility and diffusion rate of oxygen into the Nbss matrix. But the oxidation behavior aggravates with increasing the oxidation temperature. The oxide mechanism of carbide is the reaction formed C dissolving into metal oxide and desorption of CO and CO2.

The Nb2C/SWCNT contacts demonstrate a very small Schottky barrier height of similar to 18 meV (decreased by >80% relative to that of pristine Nb/SWCNT contact of similar to 98 meV) to p-type transport. This is attributed to the higher work function of Nb2C (similar to 5.2 eV) than Nb (similar to 4.3 eV) and better bonding between Nb2C and SWCNTs. The performance of Nb2C-contacted SWCNT FETs is as follows: the p-channel ON current is as high as 0.5 mu A at V-DS = 0.1 V, the I-ON/I-OFF ratio is up to similar to 10(5) and the subthreshold slope is similar to 550 mV/dec, which is as good as that of titanium carbide (TiC-) and Pd-contacted SWCNT FETs. Compared with TiC, Nb2C contacts yield more unipolar p-type SWCNT FETs, as a result of the Nb2Cs higher work function.

The present work reports on the development of 30-50 kg ingots of the alloy in correct composition as well as technology for forming the material in various shapes. The work deals with the deformation behavior of as-cast material at different temperatures and strain rates, recrystallization behavior at different temperature and time and evolution of microstructures at different processing conditions (as-cast, deformed and recrystallized). The as-cast Nb alloys were deformed up to 35% at different temperatures. The deformation results showed that the flow stress of the as-cast Nb alloy increases with increasing temperature from 800 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. Beyond 1200 degrees C, substantial decrease in the strength of the alloy was noticed. To determine the optimum recrystallization temperature and time for the alloy, several heat treatments were conducted by systematically varying temperature and time. It was found that the deformed Nb alloy could be recrystallized by annealing at 1300 C for 3 h. The microstructures of the as-cast, deformed and recrystallized samples of Nb-1%Zr-0.1%C alloy were systematically characterized by optical, electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The Nb-1Zr-0.1C alloy showed significant differences in the microstructure after different thermo-mechanical treatments. Microstructures of the Nb alloy showed two phases: the matrix (bcc) phase and the carbide phase. Electron Microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopic analyses revealed that the carbide precipitation undergoes various phase transformations. The as-cast structure of Nb alloy had hexagonal Nb2C precipitates in the Nb matrix and after extrusion, the deformed microstructure had two types of carbide precipitates: needle and rectangular morphology precipitates. The needle shape precipitates were of (Nb, Zr)2C with orthorhombic structure and rectangular shape precipitates were of (Nb, Zr)(3)C-2 with hexagonal structure. After annealing, the recrystallized microstructures showed equilibrium structure i.e. (Nb, Zr)C precipitates (fcc structure) in the Nb matrix. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Li anodes with high mass loadings, which can achieve high areal capacities, are required for many commercial applications. Herein, anodes with high mass loadings were fabricated using two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes). Powders of the latter were cold pressed, without binders, at a pressure of 1 GPa, to create similar to 300 mm thick, free-standing discs. When Ti3C2 was used as the anode for lithium, the initial reversible areal capacity was similar to 15 mu Ah/cm(2), which decreased to 5.9 mAh/cm(2) after 50 cycles, but the decrease after the first similar to 20 cycles was very gradual. The latter is one of the highest values ever reported to date. When Nb2C was used as the anode instead, the initial reversible capacity was similar to 16 mAh/cm(2); this value decreased to 6.7 mAh/cm(2) after 50 cycles, which is about a 14% increase compared to Ti3C2.

In many cases, the rigid-band model (RBM) is a useful first approximation for describing the changes in electronic properties of the host material with intercalation. The applicability of the rigid-band model is taken as a test for the properties most desirable in a good intercalation material. This review paper presents experimental results, namely optical and electrical measurements, obtained on various intercalation materials such as dichalcogenides, trichalcogenides and oxides to probe the validity of the RBM. The impact of the lithium intercalation is discussed for various structural forms, from well-crystallised to amorphous compounds. We observed, nevertheless, that the rigid-band model is not applicable to all of the layered intercalation materials. This needs yet to be more extensively documented for their promising application as insertion electrode in rechargeable lithium batteries.

The initial prototypical system Li/TiS2 showed the feasibility of high energy density systems with extensive reversibility. However, with the advent of the safe lithium-carbon anodes by Sony there is a need for higher voltage cathodes. LiCoO2 presently fulfills this need in small cells. However, for large systems where cost is an issue new oxides are needed. One approach to the formation of such oxide is low temperature hydrothermal synthesis. Mild hydrothermal reactions lead to the formation of new metastable transition metal oxide structures, not accessible by conventional high temperature methods, which have relatively open crystal structures. The nature of the cations present in solution (the ''templating ion'') has a dramatic effect on the crystal structure of the phase formed, as also does the pH of the reaction medium and the particular transition metal. Thus, by appropriate choice of reaction medium new structures containing large tunnels or channels, similar to those found in alumino-silicate zeolites, can be formed that will offer unique properties for the Materials Scientist. In particular, it is expected to be possible to realize enhanced diffusion in such materials. Here, the hydrothermal synthesis of tungsten, molybdenum and vanadium oxides is considered. The role of the cation in the synthesis is described, as well as the key interfacial reactions that are taking place. Cases are described where the cation controls the structure formed and is retained in the structure, to instances where the cation critically controls the reactions occurring but is not retained in the lattice.", "ISSN": "0167-2738", "pub": "SOLID STATE IONICS", "volume": "75", "authors": ["WHITTINGHAM, MS", "GUO, JD", "CHEN, RJ", "CHIRAYIL, T", "JANAUER, G", "ZAVALIJ, P"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "257-268"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.206", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775307013304/pdfft?md5=6d12ca9d5fb096686f12257a64c54499&pid=1-s2.0-S0378775307013304-main.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 6 2007", "title": "Progress in nonaqueous magnesium electrochemistry", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775307013304", "abstract": "We report herein on recent studies related to nonaqueous magnesium electrochemistry and R&D of rechargeable magnesium batteries. Extensive attempts have been made to examine electrolyte systems based on ionic liquids as potential solutions for nonaqueous magnesium batteries. In general, magnesium electrodes are reactive with many imidazolium-based ionic liquids. In those liquids in which Mg electrodes are apparently stable, they develop a blocking passivation. It was possible to develop improved solutions for rechargeable magnesium batteries based on mixtures of THF, tetraglyme (where the high boiling point of the polyether improves the safety features), and complexes based on Lewis acid-Lewis base reactions between AlCl2R and MgR2 or RMgCl. The choice of the type of Lewis base, the R group and the appropriate acid-base ratios enables a reasonable specific conductivity to be obtained, 100% cycling efficiency of Mg electrodes, and a wide electrochemical window, up to 2.4 V.\n\nThis work included rigorous studies by Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, ICP, and a variety of electrochemical techniques.

We have performed electron crystallographic studies on small (submicron) single crystal domains of restacked WS2 and MoS2 to solve their superstructure. We find that what initially seems to be a trigonal crystal is actually a \"triplet\" of three individual orthorhombic crystals. Using two-dimensional hkO data from films for both \"triple\" and \"single\" crystals we calculated corresponding Patterson projections, which reveal a severe distortion in the Mo/W plane, forming infinite zigzag chains. The projection of the structure suggests M-M distances of 2.92 and 2.74 a for MoS2 and WS2, respectively. Least-squares refinement from the single-crystal data gives R-1 = 13.3% for WS2 and R-1 = 15.3% for MoS2.

The microbatteries will cycle at temperatures as low as -10 degrees C at a current density of 100 mu A/cm(2), are capable of supplying pulse currents of several mA/cm(2), and have excellent long-term stability both on shelf and while cycling. Sets of five microbatteries have been assembled in either a series or parallel configuration and cycled more than 1000 times.

These two sulfur-doped TiO2, preparations showed fairly different photocatalytic activity under visible light. The dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers were studied by the transient absorption measurement in the region of mid-IR. In both samples, excitation by 532 nm pulse led to photocarrier generation to the same extent. Nevertheless, the reactivity of the photocarriers was totally different. Photogenerated electrons and holes transferred to reactant gas in the latter sample, whereas they did not in the former sample. We attributed the different carrier behavior to the difference in the distribution of S atoms or particle size. These observations can explain the difference in capability of photocatalysis under visible light. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional rechargeable batteries based on aqueous electrolytes have good rate capabilities but limited energy density because the voltage for a long shelf-life is restricted to 1.5 V. The discovery of fast Na ion conductivity in beta-alumina in 1967 introduced the novel concept of a solid oxide electrolyte and molten electrodes: the sodium-sulfur battery operates at 350 A degrees C. Interest in rechargeable batteries with aprotic electrolytes was further stimulated by the first energy crisis in the early 1970s. Since protons are not mobile in aprotic electrolytes, the Li+ ion was the logical choice for the working ion, and on-going work on reversible Li intercalation into layered sulfides suggested the TiS2//Li cell, which was shown in 1976 to have a voltage of V a parts per thousand integral aEuro parts per thousand 2.2 V and good rate capability. However, the organic liquid carbonates used as electrolytes are flammable, and dendrites growing across the electrolyte from the lithium anode on repeated charge/discharge cycles short-circuited the cells with disastrous consequences. Safety concerns caused this effort to be dropped. However, substitution of the layered oxides LiMO2 for the layered sulfides MS2 and reversible intercalation of Li into graphitic carbon without dendrite formation at slow charging rates gave a safe rechargeable lithium ion battery (LIB) of large-enough energy density to enable the wireless revolution. Although carbon-buffered alloys now provide anodes that allow a fast charge and have a higher capacity, nevertheless a passivation layer permeable to Li+ forms on the anode surface, and the Li+ in the passivation layer is taken irreversibly from the cathode on the initial charge. Since the specific capacity of a cell with an insertion-compound cathode is limited by the latter, strategies to increase the specific capacity for a LIB powering an electric vehicle or storing electricity from wind or solar farms include a return to consideration of a solid electrolyte.", "ISSN": "1432-8488", "pub": "JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY", "volume": "16", "authors": ["Goodenough, JB"], "issue": "6", "pages": "2019-2029"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.2101", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 2 1996", "title": "Sulfur K-edge x-ray-absorption study of the charge transfer upon lithium intercalation into titanium disulfide", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.2101", "abstract": "Sulfur K-edge x-ray-absorption spectra have been recorded for lithium intercalated titanium disulfides LixTiS2.

The diffraction data suggest that initially a layered phase forms due to intercalation of the alkylammonium ions which then transforms into a silicate-organic mesophase which is the precursor to the hexagonal mesoporous silicate, FSM-16.

In this study we demonstrate general applicability of synthetic protocols to a wide range of colloidal 2-D layered transition-metal chalcogenide (TMC) nanocrystals. As distinctly different from other nanocrystals, we discovered that 2-D layered TMC nanocrystals are unstable in the presence of reactive radicals from elemental chalcogen during the crystal formation. We first introduce the synthesis of titanium sulfide and selenide where well-defined single crystallinity and lateral size controllability are verified, and then such synthetic protocols are extended to all of group IV and V transition-metal sulfide (TiS2, ZrS2, HfS2, VS2, NbS2, and TaS2) and selenide (TiSe2, ZrSe3, HfSe3, VSe2, NbSe2, and TaSe2) nanocrystals. The use of appropriate chalcogen source is found to be critical for the successful synthesis of 2-D layered TMC nanocrystals. CS2 is an efficient chalcogen precursor for metal sulfide nanocrystals, whereas elemental Se is appropriate for metal selenide nanocrystals.

Since the discovery of fullerene and nanotube structures of WS2 and MoS2 by Tenne et al. [1-3], there have been attempts to prepare and characterize nanotubes of other layered dichalcogenides with structures analogous to MoS2. Nanotubes of MoS2 and WS2 were prepared by Tenne et al. by reducing the corresponding oxides to the suboxides followed by heating in an atmosphere of forming gas (5 % H-2 + 95 % N-2) and H2S at 700-900 degreesC [1-3]. Alternative methods of synthesis of MoS2 and WS2 nanotubes have since been proposed by employing the decomposition of the ammonium thiometallates or the corresponding trisulfide precursors. This alternative procedure was based on the observation that the trisulfide seems to be formed as an intermediate in the synthesis of the MoS2 and WS2 nanotubes [4]. Accordingly, the decomposition of the trisulfides of MoS2 and W in a reducing atmosphere directly yielded nanotubes of the disulfides MoS2 and WS2 [5]. In this article, we describe the synthesis, structure, and characterization of a few novel nanotubes of the disulfides of groups 4 and 5 metals. These include nanotubes of NbS2, TaS2, ZrS2, and HfS2.

In this work, four simple TMDC materials, MX2 (M = Zr and Hf, X = S and Se), are investigated by the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with different local or semilocal exchange-correlation (xc) functionals and many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation. Although the widely used Perdew-Burke-Ernzelhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) xc functional overestimates the interlayer distance dramatically, two newly developed GGA functionals, PBE-for-solids (PBEsol) and Wu-Cohen 2006 (WC06), can reproduce experimental crystal structures of these TMDC materials very well. The GW method, currently the most accurate first-principles approach for electronic band structures of extended systems, gives the fundamental band gaps of all these materials in good agreement with the experimental values obtained from optical absorption. The minimal direct gaps from GW are systematically larger than those measured from thermoreflectance by about 0.1-0.3 eV, implying that excitonic effects may be stronger than previously estimated. The calculated density of states from GW quasi-particle band energies agrees very well with photo-emission spectroscopy data. Ionization potentials of these materials are also computed by combining PBE calculations based on the slab model and GW quasi-particle corrections. The calculated absolute band energies with respect to the vacuum level indicate that that ZrS2 and HfS2, although having suitable band gaps for visible light absorption, cannot be used for overall water splitting as a result of mismatch of the conduction band minimum with the redox potential of H+/H-2.

The magnetic susceptibility data suggest that incomplete ionization of the organometallic guests occurs; there appears to be almost no correlation between the electrochemical reduction potential (E(1/2)) and the percentage of guests molecules which are ionized on intercalation.", "ISSN": "0897-4756", "pub": "CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS", "volume": "7", "authors": ["WONG, HV", "MILLETT, R", "EVANS, JSO", "BARLOW, S", "OHARE, D"], "issue": "1", "pages": "210-214"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0022-3719/19/17/010", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3719/19/17/010/pdf/0022-3719_19_17_010.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 20 1986", "title": "OPTICAL-TRANSITIONS IN ZRS2 AND ZRSE2 FROM THERMOREFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3719/19/17/010/", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-3719", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS C-SOLID STATE PHYSICS", "volume": "19", "authors": ["PELOQUIN, G", "PROVENCHER, R", "JANDL, S", "AUBIN, M"], "issue": "17", "pages": "3141-3149"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0031-8949/25/6A/027", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/1402-4896/25/6A/027/pdf/1402-4896_25_6A_027.pdf", "pubDate": "1982", "title": "A STUDY OF THE ENERGY-DEPENDENCE OF THE INTEGRATED YIELD FROM SURFACES OF IT-ZRS2 CRYSTALS", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/1402-4896/25/6A/027/", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0281-1847", "pub": "PHYSICA SCRIPTA", "volume": "25", "authors": ["MOHAMED, MH", "MOLLER, PJ"], "issue": "6", "pages": "765-767"}]], [{"pretty_formula": "ZrSe2", "unit_cell_formula": {"Zr": 1.0, "Se": 2.0}, "volume": 83.82879257172085, "material_id": "mp-2076", "total_magnetization": 0.0, "is_hubbard": false, "formation_energy_per_atom": -1.332728705729167, "band_gap": 0.33099999999999996, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.
