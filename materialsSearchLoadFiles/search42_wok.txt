Major hysteresis loops are routinely used to provide information about variations in magnetic mineralogy and grain size. Standard hysteresis parameters, however, provide a measure of the bulk magnetic properties, rather than enabling discrimination between the magnetic components that contribute to the magnetization of a sample. By contrast, first-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams, which we describe here, can be used to identify and discriminate between the different components in a mixed magnetic mineral assemblage. We use magnetization data from a class of partial hysteresis curves known as first-order reversal curves (FORCs) and transform the data into contour plots (FORC diagrams) of a two-dimensional distribution function. The FORC distribution provides information about particle switching fields and local interaction fields for the assemblage of magnetic particles within a sample. Superparamagnetic, single-domain, and multidomain grains, as well as magnetostatic interactions, all produce characteristic and distinct manifestations on a FORC diagram. Our results indicate that FORC diagrams can be used to characterize a wide range of natural samples and that they provide more detailed information about the magnetic particles in a sample than standard interpretational schemes which employ hysteresis data. It will be necessary to further develop the technique to enable a more quantitative interpretation of magnetic assemblages; however, even qualitative interpretation of FORC diagrams removes many of the ambiguities that are inherent to hysteresis data.", "ISSN": "2169-9313", "pub": "JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH", "volume": "105", "authors": ["Roberts, AP", "Pike, CR", "Verosub, KL"], "issue": "B12", "pages": "28461-28475"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/343258a0", "pdflink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v343/n6255/pdf/343258a0.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 18 1990", "title": "BIOMINERALIZATION OF FERRIMAGNETIC GREIGITE (FE3S4) AND IRON PYRITE (FES2) IN A MAGNETOTACTIC BACTERIUM", "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v343/n6255/abs/343258a0.html", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "343", "authors": ["MANN, S", "SPARKS, NHC", "FRANKEL, RB", "BAZYLINSKI, DA", "JANNASCH, HW"], "issue": "6255", "pages": "258-261"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0016-7037(96)00320-1", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703796003201/pdf?md5=b38f6724e81594442374d91ae7468dd0&pid=1-s2.0-S0016703796003201-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 1997", "title": "Formation processes of framboidal pyrite", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703796003201", "abstract": "Pyrite framboid formation may be the result of four consecutive processes: (1) nucleation and growth of initial iron monosulfide microcrystals; (2) reaction of the microcrystals to greigite (Fe3S4); (3) aggregation of uniformly sized greigite microcrystals, i.e., framboid growth; and (4) replacement of greigite framboids by pyrite. The uniform morphology, uniform size range, and ordering of the microcrystals in individual framboids, as well as the range of observed framboid structures from irregular aggregates to densely packed spherical aggregates and polyframboids, are consequences of these processes. Using DLVO theory (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek), we have evaluated the stability of colloidal, iron monosulfide suspensions with ionic strengths typical of marine and lacustrine waters. In addition to van der Waals attractive and double-layer repulsive forces, a term is included to account for the ferrimagnetic properties of greigite. Numerical models predict that magnetically saturated greigite particles >0.1 mu m in diameter will rapidly aggregate in either marine or fresh water. The aggregation model is in agreement with the sequence of greigite formation followed by pyrite framboid formation established in a previous experimental study (Sweeney and Kaplan, 1973) and is consistent with the occurrence of framboids composed of other magnetic minerals, e.g., greigite, magnetite, and magnesioferrite. Based on the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of greigite and aging experiments in hydrothermal solutions, this mechanism for framboid formation via precursor greigite could operate to temperatures of similar to 200 degrees C, consistent with the occasional occurrence of pyrite framboids in the paragenesis of metalliferous ore deposits.

In many sedimentary environments, a zone exists which releases H2S if treated with acid. The materials that produce this sulfide are described as acid volatile sulfides or AVS and the sulfide which is evolved and collected by this treatment is called acid volatile sulfide (AVS-S). In this research review we show that AVS represents part of a complex and dynamic biogeochemical system which is not defined simply by the analysis of AVS-S.\n\nDuring the 40 years since R.A. Berner first defined the concept of acid volatile sulfide, a number of scientific myths have developed regarding the nature and composition of AVS and its role in the global sulfur cycle. We show that:\n\nAVS is not equivalent to FeS and solid FeS phases have rarely been identified in marine sediments. AVS is a complex and variable component which does not represent any singular or simple group of sediment components.\n\nThe commonly used extraction methods do not quantitatively extract AVS minerals (mackinawite and greigite) without also significantly releasing sulfide from pyrite.\n\nAVS varies geographically and AVS is not the same component or set of components wherever it is found.\n\nThe solubilities of FeS and Fe3S4 in neutral to alkaline systems are presently poorly constrained and pore water saturation state calculations cannot be used to support the presence of specific AVS minerals.\n\nThe colored zone in sediments does not reflect the distribution of AVS.\n\nAVS is not always a minor fraction of total reduced sulfide (TRS) which dominantly occurs near the sediment water interface. AVS minerals are not required precursors for pyrite formation.\n\nA better understanding of the sedimentary sulfur system, including its nature, formation and transformations, is a key component in understanding the evolution of the Earth and its future development. However, some basic parameters, such as the solubility and composition of the metastable iron sulfide solids, are still not constrained. Even the presence of these minerals in most sedimentary systems remains equivocal. Aqueous FeS clusters appear to be ubiquitous and appear to have significant geochemical and biological roles. The roles of organisms, especially in modifying rates and products, remain a key area of research.\n\nAlthough AVS may have served its purpose in the earlier exploratory days of the study of sedimentary sulfides, the concept is now probably more of a hindrance than a help in advancing this field. It is reasonable to question if it is not time to simply do away with the AVS concept altogether and get on with the business of trying to deal more directly with the behavior of the more important components known to fall within the group of sulfide species that contribute to sulfide that is volatilized when acid is added to a sediment.

Several diagnostic magnetic properties can be used in conjunction to rapidly screen sediments to detect the presence of greigite. Such discriminants are necessary because greigite displays a similar (or higher) range of coercivities compared to most ferrimagnetic minerals and the commonly used method of alternating field demagnetization cannot be used to distinguish,between palaeomagnetic remanence components due to greigite and other ferrimagnetic minerals. Sedimentary greigite has high ratios of the saturation isothermal remanent magnetization to magnetic susceptibility (M(rs)/chi), which are accompanied by hysteresis ratios of M(rs)/M(s) approximate to 0.5 and B-cr/B-c approximate to 1.5 (M(s) is the saturation magnetization, B-c is the coercive force and B-cr is the coercivity of remanence). Greigite has no low-temperature phase transition, whereas the ferrimagnetic iron sulphide pyrrhotite undergoes a major phase transition at about 34 K, and unoxidized magnetite displays the Verwey transition at 118 K. Low-temperature measurements may therefore prove valuable in distinguishing between magnetite, pyrrhotite and greigite, although the absence of a low-temperature transition cannot be taken as definitive evidence for the presence of greigite.

The rate constant shows a sigmoidal temperature dependence with an average Arrhenius activation energy of 35 kJ mol(-1).\n\nThe reaction is surprisingly fast at ambient temperatures with up to 50% reaction being completed within one day. The direct dependence of the rate on cH(2)S((aq)) means that the rate is pH dependent for any fixed total sulfide concentration. In typical sulfidic aquatic systems and sediments 9 x 10(-13) to 9 x 10(-8) mol FeS2 per L sediment will be formed each day by this process. This is equivalent to approximately 3 x 10(-10) to 3 x 10(-5) mol FeS2 per g sediment per year. At pH = 7, for the same total sulfide and FeS constraints, the rate of pyrite formation 1.5 x 10(-9) to 1.5 x 10(-4) mol FeS2 per g sediment per year. In hydrothermal systems, such as deep ocean vents, the rate of pyrite formation by oxidation of FeS by H2S at 125 degrees C assuming a typical H2S concentration of 1 mM is 3.2 x 10(-6) mol L(-1) s(-1) per mol FeS. A 1 million tonne pyrite deposit could form from a solution containing 1 mmol FeS and 1 mmol H2S by this process in 1000 years at a flow rate of 0.3 Ls(-1). The fluid would have a H-2 concentration of 3 x 10(-9) M.\n\nThe process is by far the most rapid of the pyrite-forming reactions hitherto identified. Alternative pyrite-forming processes involving HS-, rather than H2S, as the reaction requires an additional oxidising agent to maintain electron balance. These pathways may involve reactants such as polysulfides or intermediaries such as greigite, Fe3S4. In natural systems, therefore, the H2S process will tend to be favored in strictly anoxic environments. In transitional environments, with limited molecular oxygen contents, pyrite formation through the polysulfide pathway or a solid state process may become more important. However, the generally low concentrations of polysulfides and greigite observed in natural pyrite-forming environments might suggest that these processes are always subordinate. The fast nature of the H2S oxidation process suggest that it makes a significant contribution to the global sulfur cycle.\n\nThe process provides a straightforward explanation of a number of observations regarding pyrite formation in natural systems, including pyrite formation in strictly anoxic environments and rapid pyrite formation. Hydrogen generation through this process in aquatic and sedimentary systems provides an important alternative metabolite for microorganism.

The aim was to propose the most effective methods for assessing mineralogy, concentration and domain state within environmental magnetic studies. Establishing the magnetic mineralogy is essential for a correct interpretation of concentration and grain-size indicative parameters. Hematite and in particular goethite are recognised by their high (remanent) coercivities. The ratio of saturation remanent magnetisation to susceptibility is suited for assessing mineralogy; for low coercivity minerals, high values of the ratio are indicative of pyrrhotite. Greigite and maghemite both have intermediate ratios, while very low values suggest the presence of (titano)magnetite. From the concentration-dependent parameters mass specific susceptibility, saturation remanent magnetisation and susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, susceptibility displayed the least grain-size dependence. Therefore, it is perhaps the best indicator of concentration, under the proviso of uniform mineralogy and when paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions are taken into consideration. All minerals showed a decrease in coercivity and remanence ratios with increasing grain size for sizes larger than one micrometer. In contrast, the coercivity of goethite showed an increase with grain size. Assessment of domain state was complicated by very small and large grains displaying similar magnetic properties.

The mineral phases of the magnetosomes are of two general types: iron oxides and iron sulfides. Iron oxide-type magnetosomes contain particles of the ferrimagnetic mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) while the iron sulfide-type contain ferrimagnetic greigite (Fe3S4), greigite and non-magnetic pyrite (FeS2), or possibly ferrimagnetic pyrrhotite (Fe7S8). Regardless of their composition, the crystalline particles in magnetosomes have a narrow size range: approximately 35 to 120 nm. Magnetite crystals in this size range are single-magnetic-domains and confer a permanent magnetic dipole moment to the cell. The single-domain size range for greigite is not known but is probably similar to that for magnetite.\n\nThe morphology of the particles in the bacterial magnetosomes appears to be species-specific. Morphologies of magnetite crystals in different species of magnetotactic bacteria include cubo-octahedra, parallelepipedal (truncated hexahedral or octahedral prisms), and tooth- or bullet-shaped (anisotropic). Morphologies of greigite particles include cube-octahedra and rectangular prismatic. The greigite-pyrite particles are generally pleomorphic with no consistent crystalline morphology. A membrane has been shown to surround the particles in some organisms and may be involved in the formation of the crystalline phase while also providing physical constraints on the size and the shape of the crystal. These results clearly indicate that the biomineralization process involved in the bacterial magnetosome, a good example of a self-assembled structure on a nanometer scale, is highly controlled by the organism.

The crystals cause the bacteria to orient themselves passively with respect to the geomagnetic field and thereby facilitate the bacteria's search for optimal conditions within the sharp chemical gradients of the OATZ. The bacteria may also gain energy from the redox cycling of their crystals.\n\nBecause magnetotactic bacteria benefit from their magnetic moments, natural selection has promoted the development of traits that increase the efficiency with which the intracellular crystals impart magnetic moments to cells. These traits also allow crystals produced by magnetotactic bacteria (called magnetofossils when preserved in sediments) to be distinguished from abiogenic particles and particles produced as extracellular byproducts of bacterial metabolism. Magnetofossils are recognizable based on their narrow size and shape distributions, distinctive morphologies with blunt crystal edges, chain arrangement, chemical purity, and crystallographic perfection. This article presents a scheme for rating magnetofossil robustness based on these traits.\n\nThe magnetofossil record extends robustly to the Cretaceous and with lesser certainty to the late Archean. Because magnetotactic bacteria predominantly live in the OATZ, the abundance and character of their fossils can reflect environmental changes that alter the chemical stratification of sediments and the water column. The magnetofossil record therefore provides an underutilized archive of paleoenvironmental information. Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between magnetofossil abundance and glacial/interglacial. cycles, likely mediated by changes in pore water oxygen levels. More speculatively, a better-developed magnetofossil record might provide constraints on the long-term evolution of marine redox stratification.\n\nMore work in modem and ancient settings is necessary to explicate the mechanisms linking the abundance and character of magnetofossils to ancient biogeochemistry.

The hysteresis properties (measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer) of natural greigite extracted from lake sediments show much higher saturation coercivity ((B0)C) and M(RS)/M(S) ratio values (approximately 50 mT and 0.5 respectively) than synthetic samples of greigite (approximately 12 mT and 0.2).

We have conducted detailed scanning electron microscope observations on polished sections from such sediments, coupled with elemental microanalysis, to identify greigite and to characterize the mode of occurrence and the relationships between the observed greigite and other authigenic and detrital mineral phases. This detailed observational work, in conjunction with recently published work, has enabled identification of several mechanisms for remagnetization involving greigite: (1) neoformation of greigite on the surfaces of early diagenetic framboidal and nodular pyrite; (2) greigite growth within cleavages of detrital sheet silicate grains; (3) neoformation of greigite on the surfaces of authigenic clays (smectite, illite); (4) greigite nucleation on the surfaces of siderite; (5) greigite growth on the surface of gypsum that resulted from earlier oxidation of nodular pyrite. Many other mechanisms for greigite neoformation are conceivable. The key variables are appropriate redox conditions for generation of sulphide and availability of iron from the dissolution of a wide range of possible reactive detrital and authigenic iron-bearing minerals. Documentation of a wide range of mechanisms for neoformation of greigite provides compelling evidence that sediments containing greigite should be routinely suspected of remagnetization, which will complicate or compromise studies of environmental magnetism and geomagnetic field behaviour.

The presence, distribution, and origin of greigite are best understood through combined magnetic and geochemical studies.  Such studies of greigite-bearing Upper Cretaceous siliciclastic beds from the Simpson Peninsula, North Slope, Alaska, reveal relations among sulfur species and magnetic properties, and they illustrate the use of geochemical analysis to constrain the age of secondary magnetization carried by greigite.  Greigite is ubiquitous in marine mudstone of the Seabee Formation, and it dominates the magnetic properties of the Seabee (magnetic susceptibility [MS]:  5.9 x 10-4 volume SI; magnitude of natural remanent magnetization [NRM]:  6.6 x 10-2 amperes/meter [A/m]; averages of 22 specimens in which greigite is the only magnetic mineral).  The Seabee rocks fill an ancient submarine canyon cut into marine, transitional, and nonmarine sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone beds of the undifferentiated Ninuluk and Seabee Formations.  In these sandstone and siltstone beds, some of which contain biodegraded oil, greigite occurs sporadically but is locally concentrated to yield high values of MS (5 x 10(-3) vol. SI) and NRM magnitude (0.5 A/m).  Samples that contain detrital iron-titanium oxides, principally titanohematite, as the only magnetic minerals have lower values of MS and NRM magnitude.\n\nDifferent geochemical signatures in the Seabee Formation and undifferentiated Ninuluk and Seabee rocks indicate different origins of their greigite and associated iron disulfide minerals.  In the Seabee, greigite and pyrite formed during early diagenesis via bacterial sulfate reduction utilizing indigenous sulfate and organic carbon.  Evidence for early diagenetic iron sulfide includes (1) negative deltaS-34 values (typically between -22 and -30 permil) of acid-volatile sulfur (sulfur in greigite) and disulfide sulfur; and (2) the common presence of greigite and framboidal pyrite in detrital plant fragments.  Ratios of total reduced mineral sulfur to organic carbon (S/C) indicate low contents of sulfur relative to those of normal marine sediments.  In the undifferentiated Ninuluk and Seabee rocks, reactions that involved epigenetic sulfur produced greigite, pyrite, and rare marcasite that cement and surround early diagenetic pyrite.  In many of these beds, S/C ratios are high relative to normal marine sediments.  The epigenetic sulfur may have been derived from (1) sulfate-bearing Paleozoic units in deeper parts of the North Slope basin to the south, perhaps during much of the Tertiary to the present; or (2) the canyon-fill Seabee during compaction of the marine mud.  Bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) in a sulfate-limited environment is indicated from many deltaS-34 values (> +22 permil) that exceed the expected values for sulfate minerals (formed from seawater sulfate) in any unit in the basin.

It can also grow at any time when dissolved iron and sulfide are available during diagenesis. Greigite is important in paleomagnetic, environmental, biological, biogeochemical, tectonic, and industrial processes. Much recent progress has been made in understanding its magnetic properties. Greigite is an inverse spinel and a collinear ferrimagnet with antiferromagnetic coupling between iron in octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The crystallographic c axis is the easy axis of magnetization, with magnetic properties dominated by magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Robust empirical estimates of the saturation magnetization, anisotropy constant, and exchange constant for greigite have been obtained recently for the first time, and the first robust estimate of the low-field magnetic susceptibility is reported here. The Curie temperature of greigite remains unknown but must exceed 350 degrees C. Greigite lacks a low-temperature magnetic transition. On the basis of preliminary micromagnetic modeling, the size range for stable single domain behavior is 17-200 nm for cubic crystals and 17-500 nm for octahedral crystals. Gradual variation in magnetic properties is observed through the pseudo-single-domain size range. We systematically document the known magnetic properties of greigite (at high, ambient, and low temperatures and with alternating and direct fields) and illustrate how grain size variations affect magnetic properties.

The material adsorbs between 100 and 400 mg g(-1) and residual levels in solutions can be of the order of pg per litre. Further, strongly magnetic forms of this material can now be produced which can be effectively and cheaply removed from suspension together with the adsorbate by magnetic separation. This paper examines the structure of weakly magnetic and strongly magnetic iron sulphide material produced by SRB with a view to increasing the understanding of its adsorbent and the magnetic properties. The structural properties have been examined using high-resolution imaging and electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), the measurements of magnetisation versus field and temperature, extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. Before drying the surface area of both the weakly magnetic and the strongly magnetic iron sulphide is of the order of 400-500 m(2) g(-1) as revealed by the magnetic properties, neutron scattering and the adsorption of a number of heavy metals. After freeze-drying the surface area falls to between 18 and 19 m(2) g(-1). The initial inocula came from a semi-saline source and when fed with nutrient containing Fe2+ and Fe3+ produced a weakly magnetic iron sulphide (Watson et al., Minerals Eng. 8 (1995) 1097) and a few % of a more strongly magnetic material. Further work using a novel method (Keller-Besrest, Collin, J. Solid State Chem. 84 (1990) 211) produced a strongly magnetic iron sulphide material. EXAFS and XANES spectroscopy revealed (Keller-Besrest and Collin, 1990) that the weakly magnetic iron sulphide material had the Ni-As structure in which the Fe is tetrahedrally coordinated with the composition Fe1-xS. The strongly magnetic iron sulphide was composed of some greigite (Fe3S4) and mackinawite (Fe1+xS), however, the bulk of the material at room temperature probably consists of disordered greigite and mackinawite.

EPR and Mossbauer studies of the enzyme prepared in four different oxidation states show that the enzyme contains two Fe4S4 and one Fe3S4 cluster. In the oxidized (2+) state, the Mossbauer parameters of the two Fe4S4 clusters are typical for this cluster type. Upon reduction, however, these clusters do not exhibit the familiar g = 1.94 signal. The unusual nature of the reduced clusters is also borne out by the Mossbauer spectra which exhibit fairly small magnetic hyperfine interactions similar to those of centers I and II of the Desulfovibrio gigas enzyme. The Mossbauer spectra of the Fe3S4 cluster in the oxidized (1+) and reduced states are typical for this cluster type. The C. vinosum hydrogenase undergoes a reversible redox reaction at E(m) = + 150 mV (vs NHE). Above + 150 mV the EPR spectra exhibit signals (previously called signals 2 and 4) that reflect a weak interaction between Ni(III) and an Fe-containing moiety. By clamping the Ni in the diamagnetic Ni(II).CO form, we have discovered that signal 2 (X-band resonances at g = 2.01, 1.974, and 1.963) involves the Fe3S4 cluster and an as yet unidentified paramagnetic moiety. The ''coupled'' system exhibits magnetic hyperfine interactions quite different from those of the uncoupled [Fe3S4](1+) cluster. We have not yet been able to assign a spin to the coupled state but some of the features of the state are reminiscent of an S = 1 system. The Mossbauer data suggest, but do not prove, that an extra Fe site may be present that shuttles between low-spin Fe(III) and low-spin Fe(II) with E(m) = + 150 mV. The Fe(III) may be located between the Ni(III) and the Fe3S4 cluster enabling it to mediate the interaction between the cluster and the Ni site. In this picture, the Fe(III) site is part of the coupled state that gives rise to signal 2. Other possibilities for signal 2 involve a ligand-based oxidation of the [Fe3S4](1+) cluster or generation of a nearby radical.", "ISSN": "0006-2960", "pub": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "volume": "33", "authors": ["SURERUS, KK", "CHEN, M", "VANDERZWAAN, JW", "RUSNAK, FM", "KOLK, M", "DUIN, EC", "ALBRACHT, SPJ", "MUNCK, E"], "issue": "16", "pages": "4980-4993"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1992", "title": "Magnetite in human tissues: a mechanism for the biological effects of weak ELF magnetic fields.", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "\nDue to the apparent lack of a biophysical mechanism, the question of whether weak, low-frequency magnetic fields are able to influence living organisms has long been one of the most controversial subjects in any field of science. However, two developments during the past decade have changed this perception dramatically, the first being the discovery that many organisms, including humans, biochemically precipitate the ferrimagnetic mineral magnetite (Fe3O4). In the magnetotactic bacteria, the geomagnetic response is based on either biogenic magnetite or greigite (Fe3S4), and reasonably good evidence exists that this is also the case in higher animals such as the honey bee. Second, the development of simple behavioral conditioning experiments for training honey bees to discriminate magnetic fields demonstrates conclusively that at least one terrestrial animal is capable of detecting earth-strength magnetic fields through a sensory process. In turn, the existence of this ability implies the presence of specialized receptors which interact at the cellular level with weak magnetic fields in a fashion exceeding thermal noise. A simple calculation shows that magnetosomes moving in response to earth-strength ELF fields are capable of opening trans-membrane ion channels, in a fashion similar to those predicted by ionic resonance models. Hence, the presence of trace levels of biogenic magnetite in virtually all human tissues examined suggests that similar biophysical processes may explain a variety of weak field ELF bioeffects.\n", "ISSN": "0197-8462", "pub": "Bioelectromagnetics", "volume": "Suppl 1", "authors": ["Kirschvink, J L", "Kobayashi-Kirschvink, A", "Diaz-Ricci, J C", "Kirschvink, S J"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "101-13"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "AUG 1998", "title": "Tetrachloroethene dehalogenase from Dehalospirillum multivorans: Cloning, sequencing of the encoding genes, and expression of the pceA gene in Escherichia coli", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The genes encoding tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenase, a corrinoid-Fe/S protein, of Dehalospirillum multivorans were cloned and sequenced.

The samples display magnetic properties that indicate the presence of ferrimagnetic iron sulphide minerals. Paired samples were also investigated to compare the palaeomagnetic behaviour with respect to different demagnetization treatments (thermal, static and tumbling alternating field (AF) demagnetization). Greigite (Fe3S4) was positively identified in most samples. In agreement with previous studies of greigite, the sediments display: thermal decomposition of the magnetic carriers at temperatures above ca. 230 degrees C, resulting in decreased magnetic susceptibility values and maximum unblocking temperatures (T-ub) mostly in the range 320-350 degrees C; high saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) to low-held magnetic susceptibility (k) ratios (SIRM/k > 10 kA/m); hysteresis ratios that are typical for single domain (SD) grains (M-rs/M-s > 0.5 and (B-0)(cr)/(B-0)(c) < 1.5, where M-rs is the saturation remanence, M-s is the saturation magnetization, (B-0)(c) is the coercive force and (B-0)(cr) is the coercivity of remanence); moderate coercivity, with (B-0)(cr) values that range between 52 and 81 mT and a tendency to acquire a significant rotational remanent magnetization (RRM). We also found that greigite-bearing sediments are particularly sensitive to field impressed anisotropy. We propose a new magnetic parameter that can be used as a rapid mean to screen a rock sample for the presence of greigite, which relies on its SD behaviour in field impressed anisotropy experiments. In greigite-bearing sediments, the magnetic susceptibility measured in a given direction is increased by the application of a relatively high magnetic field (0.9 T in our experiments) at right angles to this direction. The susceptibility increase is directly correlated to the concentration of greigite in the sediment. The comparative palaeomagnetic analysis of standard demagnetization techniques indicates that thermal demagnetization, in close steps up to 350-380 degrees C, is clearly the most effective treatment for the isolation of the remanent magnetization carried by greigite, whereas AF demagnetization treatments display significant acquisition of unwanted magnetic remanences (gyroremanent remanent magnetization (GRM) and RRM) at fields above ca. 40 mT.

An integrated approach using fluorescence- and electron microscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization, lipid biomarkers, stable isotopes (delta(13)C), and petrography revealed insight into the anatomy of concretionary methane-derived carbonates currently forming within the sediment around seeps. Some of the carbonate concretions have been found to be surrounded by microbial mats. The mats harbour colonies of sulphate-reducing bacteria (DSS-group), and archaea (ANME-1), putative players in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Isotopically-depleted lipid biomarkers indicate an uptake of methane carbon into the biomass of the mat biota, Microbial metabolism sustains the precipitation of concretionary carbonates, significantly depleted in C-13. The concretions consist of rectangularly orientated, rod- to dumbbell-shaped crystal aggregates made of fibrous high Mg-calcite. The sulphate-reducing bacteria exhibit intracellular storage inclusions, and magnetosomes with greigite (Fe3S4), indicating that iron cycling is involved in the metabolism of the microbial population.

The magnetic pattern is dominated by fluctuations in the concentration of a single domain ferrimagnetic component identified as bacterial magnetofossils by TEM investigation of the magnetic fraction. The intervals of low bacterial magnetite concentration, occurring in glacial periods, are accompanied by a change of the bacterial magnetosome morphology assemblage interpreted as recording a change in bacterial species assemblage. There is no evidence of iron or sulphate reducing conditions during low bacterial magnetite intervals. Concentrations of bacterial magnetite are low when oxygen concentrations in surface sediment pore waters dropped, either as the result of variation in bottom water oxygen concentration or sedimentation rate. The variations in the magnetic signal are therefore interpreted as resulting primarily from bacterial palaeoecological control rather than dissolution or alteration.

The sediments have uniform lithology and geochemical properties, however, marked down-core changes in magnetic properties suggest that diagenesis has significantly impacted the magnetic properties. An expanded view of early diagenetic reactions that affect magnetic mineral assemblages is evident in these rapidly deposited continental shelf sediments compared to deep-sea sediments. The studied sediments are divided into four descending intervals, based on magnetic property variations. Interval 1 is least affected by diagenesis and has the highest concentrations of detrital magnetite and hematite, and the lowest solid-phase sulfur contents. Interval 2 is characterized by the presence of paramagnetic pyrite and sharply decreasing magnetite and hematite concentrations, which suggest active reductive dissolution of detrital magnetic minerals. Interval 3 is marked by a progressive loss of hematite with depth, and coincides with the minimum magnetite concentration. Interval 4 has an increasing down-core enhancement of authigenic greigite, which apparently formed at depths of 3-30 m below the sediment-water interface due to arrested pyritization reactions. These results indicate delays of thousands of years for acquisition of magnetizations carried by greigite, which suggests that studies of geomagnetic field behavior from greigite-bearing continental shelf sediments should be conducted with care. Also, virtually complete destruction of detrital magnetic minerals at depth suggests that magnetic studies of rapidly deposited shelf sediments are unlikely to provide a meaningful signature associated with syndepositional environmental processes.", "ISSN": "2169-9313", "pub": "JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH", "volume": "109", "authors": ["Liu, J", "Zhu, RX", "Roberts, AP", "Li, SQ", "Chang, JH"], "issue": "B3", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0304-4203(95)00082-8", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304420395000828/pdf?md5=17df6afb198f4b459d8bc6c734dc92c8&pid=1-s2.0-0304420395000828-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 1996", "title": "Pyrite formation under conditions approximating those in anoxic sediments .1.

Results indicate that the rate of pyrite formation strongly depends on the nature of solid reactant and solution chemistry (pH and total sulfide concentration). The formation of pyrite is most rapid in the presence of greigite. The pyritization of metastable iron sulfide minerals follows a dissolution-precipitation pathway.\n\nTwo mechanisms are proposed for the nucleation behavior of pyrite on metastable iron sulfide minerals. The first mechanism is heterogeneous nucleation. This is a result of epitaxial overgrowth of pyrite nuclei at defects on a precursor mineral's surface. A second possible mechanism is that pyrite clusters, smaller than the critical nucleus, are concentrated on the surface of precursor iron sulfide minerals under the influence of crystal molecular field. This forms a transition layer between the precursor sulfide mineral and the bulk solution where nucleation of pyrite is accelerated.\n\nSEM observations indicate that the morphology of pyrite crystals formed at room temperature is primarily controlled by the degree of supersaturation in the solution from which pyrite is precipitated. With the increasing supersaturation, pyrite morphology changes in the following order: cube --> octahedron --> spherulite.

Based on magnetic properties and X-ray diffraction analysis, previous studies have reported widespread occurrences of these magnetic minerals along with magnetite (Fe3O4) in two thick Plio-Pleistocene marine sedimentary sequences from southwestern Taiwan. Different stratigraphic zones were classified according to the dominant magnetic mineral assemblages (greigite-, pyrrhotite-, and magnetite-dominated zones). Greigite and pyrrhotite are intimately associated with fine-grained sediments, whereas magnetite is more abundant in coarse-grained sediments. We measured total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS), total iron (Fe-T) IN HCl extractable iron (Fe-A), and bulk sediment grain size for different stratigraphic zones in order to understand the factors governing the formation and preservation of the two magnetic iron sulfide minerals. The studied sediments have low TS/Fe-A weight ratios (0.03-0.2), far below that of pyrite (1.15), which indicates that an excess of reactive iron was available for pyritization. Observed low TS (0.05-0.27%) is attributed to the low organic carbon contents (TOC=0.25-0.55%), which resulted from dilution by rapid terrigenous sedimentation. The fine-grained sediments also have the highest Fe-T and Fe-A values. We suggest that under conditions of low organic carbon provision, the high iron activity in the fine-grained sediments may have removed reduced sulfur so effectively that pyritization was arrested or retarded, which, in turn, favored preservation of the intermediate magnetic iron sulfides. The relative abundances of reactive iron and labile organic carbon appear to have controlled the transformation pathway of amorphous FeS into greigite or into pyrrhotite. Compared to pyrrhotite-dominated sediments, greigite-dominated sediments are finer-grained and have higher Fe-A but lower TS. We suggest that diagenetic environments with higher supply of reactive iron, lower supply of labile organic matter, and, consequently, lower sulfide concentration result in relatively high Eh conditions, which favor formation of greigite relative to pyrrhotite.

The dissolving of the tin metal in ethylenediamine and the role of NH4Cl are discussed. The crystal Structure of Sn4As3 has been re-determined. It is shown to crystallize in the trigonal noncentrosymmetric space group R3m, (a = 4.089(1)angstrom, c = 36.059(6)angstrom, Z = 3), which differs from the previously reported centrosymmetric structure (Rim). The crystal structure of Sn4As3 consists of alternating layers ofarsenic and tin atoms that are combined into seven-layer blocks and build up along the c-axis. The major structural feature is the short tin-tin distances (3.24 angstrom) between the adjacent blocks. The analysis of the density of states and band structure reveals that Sn4As3 should have metallic properties, which is in line with the previously reported experimental observations. Analysis of chemical bonding employing the electron localization function shows that only for the shortest Sn-As contacts the bonding is pairwise, while four-center bonds are formed between arsenic and tin atoms at relatively long distances ( > 2.85 angstrom). Moreover, each tin atom holds an electron lone-pair. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
