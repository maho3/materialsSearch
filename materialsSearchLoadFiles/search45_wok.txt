All these adducts are ionic salts containing pentagonal planar XeF5- anions as shown by a crystal structure determination of N(CH3)4+XeF5-, Raman and infrared spectra, and F-19 and Xe-129 NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray crystal structure of N(CH3)4+XeF5- was determined at -86-degrees-C. This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Pmcn, with four molecules in a unit cell of dimensions a = 6.340 (2) angstrom, b = 10.244 (3) angstrom, and c = 13.896 (4) angstrom with R = 0.0435 for 638 observed [I > 3-sigma(I)] reflections. In addition to four N(CH3)4+ cations, the structure contains four pentagonal planar XeF5- anions per unit cell with D5h symmetry. The Xe-F distances are 1.979 (2)-2.034 (2) angstrom with F-Xe-F angles of 71.5 (4)-72.3 (4)degrees. The D5h structure of the XeF5- anion is highly unusual and represents the first example of an AX5E2 (E = valence electron lone pair) species in which all six atoms are coplanar. The results from the crystal structure determination and a normal coordinate analysis show that the XeF5 plane of XeF5- is considerably more rigid than that in the fluxional IF7 molecule due to the increased repulsion from the xenon free valence electron pairs. Local density functional calculations were carried out for XeF5- and XeF4 with a double-numerical basis set augmented by polarization functions and confirm the experimentally observed geometries and vibrational spectra. It is shown that the bonding in XeF5- closely resembles that in XeF4. In a valence bond description, it can be visualized as the two axial positions being occupied by two sp-hybridized free valence electron pairs and the equatorial fluorines being bound by two Xe 5p electron pairs through semiionic multicenter four-electron bonds.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "113", "authors": ["CHRISTE, KO", "CURTIS, EC", "DIXON, DA", "MERCIER, HP", "SANDERS, JCP", "SCHROBILGEN, GJ"], "issue": "9", "pages": "3351-3361"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0009-2614(92)85420-F", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000926149285420F/pdf?md5=2d1b89c1dca3ddbcf9d794d4b5431bf4&pid=1-s2.0-000926149285420F-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 24 1992", "title": "3-CENTER 4-ELECTRON BONDS AND THEIR INDEXES", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000926149285420F", "abstract": "Two-center and three-center bond indices have been calculated using sp and spd basis sets for some hypervalent compounds (H-3-, FHF-, ClHCl-, F3-, Cl3-, ClF3, SF4, XeF2 and XeF4).

To achieve near chemical accuracy (+/- 1 kcal/mol), up to four corrections were added to the complete basis set binding energies based on frozen core coupled cluster theory energies: a correction for core-valence effects, a correction for scalar relativistic effects, a correction for first-order atomic spin-orbit effects, and in some cases, a second-order spin-orbit correction. Vibrational zero-point energies were computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The structure of XeF6 is difficult to obtain with the C-3v and O-h structures having essentially the same energy. The O-h structure is only 0.19 kcal/mol below the C-3v one at the CCSD(T)/CBS level using an approximate geometry for the C-3v structure. With an optimized C-3v geometry, the C-3v structure would probably become slightly lower in energy than the Oh one. The calculated heats of formation for the neutral XeFn fluorides are less negative than the experimental values from the equilibrium measurements by 2.0, 7.7, and 12.2 kcal/mol for n = 2, 4, and 6, respectively. For the experimental values, derived from the photoionization measurements, this discrepancy becomes even larger, suggesting a need for a redetermination of the experimental values.

Analysis of Xe-129 and F-19 NMR spectra acquired with magic-angle spinning at several spinning rates indicates that the Xe and F magnetic shielding tensors are axially symmetric, as dictated by the crystal symmetry. The isotropic Xe-129 chemical shift is -1603 +/- 5 ppm with respect to OXeF4 (neat liquid, 24 degreesC) and the Xe magnetic shielding anisotropy, Omega, is 4245 +/- 20 ppm, the first anisotropy measured directly for a xenon compound. The parallel component of the experimentally determined xenon chemical shift tensor, delta(parallel to) = -4433 ppm differs from delta(Xe(free atom)) by similar to1000 ppm, providing the first experimental demonstration that relativistic effects play an important role in the nuclear magnetic shielding for xenon. Both the sign and magnitude of the isotropic indirect Xe-129,F-19 nuclear spin-spin coupling constant are determined, -5560 +/- 50 Hz.

A displacement reaction between N2F+AsF6- and FNO yields exclusively cis-N2F2.  The Lewis acids BF3 and PF5 do not form a stable adduct with cis-N2F2 at temperatures as low as -78-degrees-C and do not catalyze the N2F2 trans-cis isomerization.  A semiempirical molecular orbital model is used to explain the puzzling differences in the reaction chemistry of cis- and trans-N2F2.  The crystal structure of N2F+AsF6- (monoclinic, C2/m, a = 9.184 (5) angstrom, b = 5.882 (2) angstrom, c = 5.160 (2) angstrom, beta = 90.47 (4)-degrees, Z = 2) was determined.  Alternate space groups (Cm and C2) can be rejected on the basis of the observed vibrational spectra.  Since in C2/m the N2F+ cations are disordered, only the sum of the N-F and N-N bond distances could be determined from the X-ray data.  Local density functional calculations were carried out for N2F+ and the well-known isoelectronic FCN molecule.  The results from these calculations allowed the sum of the N2F+ bond lengths to be partitioned into the individual bond distances.  The resulting N-F bond length of 1.217 angstrom is by far the shortest presently known N-F bond, while the N-N bond length of 1.099 angstrom is comparable to the shortest presently known N-N bond length of 1.0976 (2) angstrom in N2.  The surprising shortness of both bonds is attributed to the high s-character (sp hybrid) of the sigma-bond orbitals on nitrogen and the formal positive charge on the cation.  Thus, the shortening of the N-F bond on going from sp3-hybridized NF4+ (1.30 angstrom) to sp-hybridized N2F+ (1.22 angstrom) parallels those found for the C-H and C-F bonds in the CH4, CH2 = CH2, CH = CH and CF4, CF2 = CF2, FC = N series, respectively.  The oxidative power of N2F+ has also been studied.  The N2F+ cation oxidized Xe and ClF to XeF+ and ClF2+, respectively, but did not oxidize ClF5, BrF5, IF5, XeF4, NF3, or O2.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "113", "authors": ["CHRISTE, KO", "WILSON, RD", "WILSON, WW", "BAU, R", "SUKUMAR, S", "DIXON, DA"], "issue": "10", "pages": "3795-3800"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja00889a034", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "1963", "title": "HEATS OF SUBLIMATION OF XEF2 AND XEF4 AND A CONJECTURE ON BONDING IN SOLIDS", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00889a034", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "85", "authors": ["JORTNER, J", "RICE, SA", "WILSON, EG"], "issue": "6", "pages": "814-&"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0003-2670(93)85303-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003267093853032/pdf?md5=d7c9abce9e72e1fc75cc98cfd2cbabcd&pid=1-s2.0-0003267093853032-main.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 26 1993", "title": "SIMULTANEOUS ATOMIC FLUORESCENCE SPECTROMETRIC DETERMINATION OF TRACES OF IRON, COBALT AND NICKEL AFTER CONVERSION TO THEIR CARBONYLS AND GAS-PHASE ATOMIZATION BY MICROWAVE-INDUCED PLASMA", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003267093853032", "abstract": "In sample solution iron-group metals are converted into volatile carbonyls by means of reductive carbonylation by simultaneous treatment with carbon monoxide and NaBH4. rhe carbonyls released are collected in a cold trap packed with pyrolytic carbon filaments that have been treated preliminarily with a low-pressure oxygen plasma.

BPPT is found to improve the shift range and relative shifts as compared to the nonrelativistic (NR) theory. While the full BPPT expansion consists of 16 relativistic terms, 5 of them are responsible for the entire chemical shift and shielding anisotropy. The remaining terms are practically isotropic, corelike contributions that are significant for the absolute shielding constant but cancel for the relative chemical shifts. The five principal terms are due to the spin-orbit-modified wave function allowing the Fermi contact and spin-dipole hyperfine interactions to be coupled to the orbital Zeeman interaction, as well as three distinct scalar relativistic modifications of the NR paramagnetic shielding: wave function change due to mass-velocity and Darwin interactions and the relativistic modification of the orbital hyperfine interaction. A very good agreement with the experimental shifts is obtained for XeF2 and the particularly challenging XeF+ species when both the NR and the five main relativistic terms are calculated at electron-correlated ab initio levels of theory. The performance of density-functional theory (DFT) with different pure and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals (with increasing exact exchange admixture) is tested against the ab initio data for each individual contribution. It is shown that DFT has difficulties in the description of paramagnetic shielding, already and especially in the NR contribution, which causes a large discrepancy of DFT results with experiment for xenon fluorides. In contrast, the DFT errors for the relativistic terms cancel out to the extent that a fairly good approximation of the total relativistic shift and anisotropy contributions may be obtained. A combination of high-level ab initio NR calculation with hybrid DFT estimates of the five main BPPT terms is proposed for reasonable estimates of xenon chemical shift in molecules. For the difficult cases such as the present XeF+ and XeF3+ cations, correlated ab initio calculations are unavoidable throughout. None of the other currently available relativistic methods, either at the fully relativistic or a variationally stable quasirelativistic levels of theory, surpasses the quality of the present approach for Xe shifts in these systems.

In particular, the relativistic zeroth-order regular approximation density-functional theory (ZORA-DFT) approach holds great promise for the calculation of spin-spin coupling constants for a variety of chemical systems containing heavy nuclei. In the present work, the ZORA-DFT method is applied to the calculation of the complete reduced coupling tensors, K, for a range of chlorine-, bromine-, iodine-, and xenon-containing species: K(Cl,F) for CIF2+, CIF3, CIF4+, CIF5, CIF6-, and CIF6+; K(Br,F) for BrF3, BrF6-, and BrF6+; K(I,F) for IF4+ and IF6+; K(Xe,F) for XeF+, XeF2, XeF3+, XeF4, XeF5-, XeF5+, and XeF7+. These species represent a wide variety of geometrical bonding arrangements. Agreement between the calculated coupling constants and available experimental data is excellent, and the absolute sign of the coupling constants is provided. It is shown that K-1(iso) may be positive or negative even within the same molecule, e.g., K(Cl,F)(iso) may be of either sign, depending on the local environment. Periodic trends in K-1(iso) for isovalent and isostructural molecules are evident. The spin-spin coupling anisotropies, DeltaK, and the orientations of the K tensors are also determined. The success of the calculations is a direct result of employing reliable geometries and considering both scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects. The dependence of K(Cl,F)(iso) and K(Xe,F)(iso) on the local molecular and electronic structure is discussed in terms of the paramagnetic spin-orbit (PSO) and combined Fermi-contact spin-dipolar (FC+SD) coupling mechanisms. The PSO term depends strongly on the number of valence shell electron lone pairs on the central heavy atom, and the FC+SD contribution increases with the Cl-F or Xe-F bond length for a given series of compounds.

The nonrelativistic limit Hartree-Fock calculations were also performed for XeF4 at various internuclear distances.  The calculated relativistic correction to the total energy of molecule at the Dirac-Fock level is approximately -5856 eV, whereas the magnetic part of the Breit correction to the electron-electron interaction is calculated as approximately 177 eV.  The electron correlation effects were included in the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock calculations using the second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) theory, and the calculated correlation energy for XeF4 is -71 eV.  The basis-set superposition error (BSSE) was estimated by using the counterpoise method for Xe and F.  The inclusion of both the relativistic and electron correlation effects in the calculated total energies of F, Xe, and XeF4 predicts the Xe-F bond length and dissociation energy of XeF4 as 1.952 angstrom and 5.59 eV, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the experimental values of 1.953 angstrom and 5.69 eV, respectively, for XeF4.  The contribution of the electron correlation and relativistic effects to the dissociation energy of XeF4 is 8.11 and 0.05 eV, respectively.  The Breit interaction, however, contributes only 0.02 eV to the dissociation energy of XeF4.  Electron correlation is most significant for the prediction of an accurate value of dissociation energy, whereas relativistic effects are very important for the prediction of spin-orbital splitting as well as the energies of the orbitals, especially the inner orbitals of XeF4.

Many bench chemists are interested in qualitative VB representations of electronic structure. In this review, we are concerned primarily with how to represent the electronic structures of many electron-rich fluorine-containing molecules via VB methods. Without valence shell expansion for atoms of second-row and higher row elements, our review provides VB structures for the following molecules: FOOF, FSSF, F2SS, FSO, FNO, FSN, FNO2, F3NO, F3CO-, PF5, SF4, ClF5, XeF4, SF6, ClF5, XeF4, BrF6-, IF7, (HF)(2), HF2- and F-3(-), via the use of increased-valence representations for the four-electron three-centre bonding units which are present in each of them. Increased-valence structures are equivalent to resonance between familiar standard or Kekule-type Lewis structures and \"long-bond\" or Dewar-type Lewis structures. Consideration is also given to several hypercoordinate molecules whose bond lengths suggest that valence shell expansion does occur in the primary VB structures. The results of density functional estimates of the energies and geometries for several pairs of fluorine-containing isomers are also reported. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ion pairing results from secondary bonding interactions between the fluorine/oxygen atoms of the anions and the xenon atom of the cation, with the Xe center dot center dot center dot F/O contacts occurring opposite the axial fluorine and from beneath the equatorial XeF4-planes of the XeF5+ and Xe2F11+ cations so as to avoid the free valence electron lone pairs of the xenon atoms. The xenon atoms of [XeF5][mu-F(OsO3F2)(2)] and [Xe2F11][OsO3F3] are nine-coordinate and the xenon atom of [XeF5][OsO3F3] is eight-coordinate. Quantum-chemical calculations at SVWN and B3LYP levels of theory were used to obtain the gas-phase geometries, vibrational frequencies, and NBC bond orders, valencies, and NPA charges of the ion pairs, [Xe2F11][OsO3F3], [XeF5][OsO3F3], and [XeF5][mu-F(OsO3F2)(2)], as well as those of the free ions, Xe2F11+ XeF5+, OsO3F3-, and mu-F(OsO3F2)(2)(-). The Raman spectra (-150 degrees C) of the salts have been assigned based on the ion pairs observed in the crystal structures and the calculated vibrational frequencies and intensities of the gas-phase ion pairs.", "ISSN": "0020-1669", "pub": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "volume": "49", "authors": ["Hughes, MJ", "Mercier, HPA", "Schrobilgen, GJ"], "issue": "7", "pages": "3501-3515"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-2860(94)07984-6", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022286094079846/pdf?md5=f52af05ba2e4a7a3fef9fd2deff92839&pid=1-s2.0-0022286094079846-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL 7 1994", "title": "VIBRATIONAL-SPECTRA OF SOLID CRF4 AND OF 3 NEW FLUOROCHROMATE(IV) COMPLEXES WITH XE FLUORIDES, XEF2.CRF4, (XEF5+CRF5-)4.XEF4 AND XEF5+CRF5-", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022286094079846", "abstract": "Spectra of solid CrF4 show bands assigned to stretching vibrations of terminal and bridging fluorine atoms, indicating a polymeric structure.

The SFX2C-1e scheme gains its computational efficiency, in comparison to the four-component approach, from a focus on spin-free contributions and from the elimination of the small component. For the calculation of nuclear magnetic shieldings, the separation of spin-free and spin-dependent terms in the parent four-component theory is carried out here for the matrix representation of the Dirac equation in terms of a restricted-magnetically balanced gauge-including atomic orbital basis. The resulting spin-free four-component matrix elements required to calculate nuclear magnetic shieldings are then used to construct the corresponding SFX2C-1e Hamiltonian and its perturbed counterpart in the context of SFX2C-1e analytic derivative theory. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we report coupled-cluster calculations for prototypical problems such as the O-17 shieldings of transition-metal oxo complexes (MO42-, M = Cr, Mo, and W) and the Xe-129 shieldings of xenon fluorides (XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6).
