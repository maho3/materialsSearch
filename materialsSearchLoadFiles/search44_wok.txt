The transducer function is deeply related with the microstructure of the elements, i.e., the grain size of SnO2 (D) and the depth of the surface space-charge layer (L). The sensitivity is drastically promoted when D is made comparable to or less than 2L, either by control of D for pure SnO2 elements or by control of the Debye length for impurity-doped elements. On the other hand, the receptor function is drastically modified by the introduction of foreign receptors on the surface of SnO2. In the particular cases of Pd and Ag promoters, the oxides (PdO and Ag2O) formed in air interact with the SnO2 surface to produce an electron-deficient space-charge layer, and this contributes much to promoting the gas sensitivity. For a test gas having a specific reactivity, such specificity can be utilized for exploiting gas-selective receptors. as exemplified by CuO-SnO2 and La2O3-SnO2 elements, which detect H2S and ethanol gas respectively very sensitively.", "ISSN": "0925-4005", "pub": "SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL", "volume": "5", "authors": ["YAMAZOE, N"], "issue": "1-4", "pages": "7-19"}, {"DOI": "10.1023/A:1015820616384", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1015820616384.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2002", "title": "The Pacific decadal oscillation", "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015820616384", "abstract": "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been described by some as a long-lived El Nino-like pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: \"cool\" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and again from 1947-1976, while \"warm\" PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations-at a range of varying time scales-can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities-one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years-the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.", "ISSN": "0916-8370", "pub": "JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY", "volume": "58", "authors": ["Mantua, NJ", "Hare, SR"], "issue": "1", "pages": "35-44"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "AUG 1981", "title": "THE GLADSTONE - DALE RELATIONSHIP: PART IV.

The second decomposition is between 800 and 850-degrees-C and behaves like crystalline palladium oxide designated (PdO). To reform the oxide, the temperature must be decreased well below 650-degrees-C. Thus, there is a significant hysteresis between decomposition to palladium and re-formation of the oxide.

One may conclude that the high temperature (> 500-degrees-C) activity of a supported palladium containing catalyst is due to the ability of palladium oxide to chemisorb oxygen.

Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variations in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection - the fundamental processes controlling salinity and nutrient concentrations. Nutrient fluctuations drive concomitant changes in phytoplankton concentrations, and may force similar variability in higher trophic levels. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuations in the mechanisms driving planktonic ecosystem dynamics.

However, the Southwest is located between the mid-latitude and subtropical atmospheric circulation regimes, and this positioning relative to shifts in these regimes is the fundamental reason for the region's climatic variability. Furthermore, the Southwest's complex topography and its geographical proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico also contribute to this region's high climatic variability, El Nino, which is an increase in sea-surface temperature of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean with an associated shift of the active center of atmospheric convection from the western to the central equatorial Pacific, has a well-developed teleconnection with the Southwest, usually resulting in wet winters. La Nina, the opposite oceanic case of El Nino usually results in dry winters for the Southwest. Another important oceanic influence on winter climate of the Southwest is a feature called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has been defined as temporal variation in sea-surface temperatures for most of the Northern Pacific Ocean, The effects of ENSO and PDO can amplify each other, resulting in increased annual variability in precipitation over the Southwest. The major feature that sets the climate of the Southwest apart from the rest of the United States is the North American monsoon, which in the US is most noticeable in Arizona and New Mexico, Up to 50% of the annual rainfall of Arizona and New Mexico occurs as monsoonal storms from July through September. Instrumental measurement of temperature and precipitation in the Southwest dates back to the middle to late 1800s, From that record, average annual rainfall of Arizona is 322 mm (12.7\"), while that of New Mexico is 340 nun (13.4\"), and mean annual temperature of New Mexico is cooler (12degreesC [53degreesF]) than Arizona (17degreesC [62degreesF]). As instrumental meteorological records extend back only about 100 to 120 yr throughout the Southwest, they are of limited utility for studying climate phenomena of long time frames. Hence, there is a need to extend the measured meteorological record further back in time using so-called 'natural archive' pal eo climate records. Tree-ring data, which provide annual resolution, range throughout the Southwest, extend back in time for up to 1000 yr or more in various forests of the Southwest, and integrate well the influences of both temperature and precipitation, are useful for this assessment of climate of the Southwest. Tree growth of mid-elevation forests typically responds to moisture availability during the growing season, and a commonly used climate variable in paleo-precipitation studies is the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which is a single variable derived from variation in precipitation and temperature. June-August PDSI strongly represents precipitation and, to a lesser extent, temperature of the year prior to the growing season (prior September through current August), The maximum intra-ring density of higher elevation trees can yield a useful record of summer temperature variation. The combined paleo-modern climate record has at least 3 occurrences of multi-decadal variation (50 to 80 yr) of alternating dry (below average PDSI) to wet (above average PDSI). The amplitude of this variation has increased since the 1700s.

Correlations of western US precipitation with SOI and other indices of tropical El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) processes were much weaker from 1920 to 1950 than during recent decades. This variability in teleconnections is associated with the character of tropical air-sea interactions as indexed by the number of out-of-phase SOI/tropical sea surface temperature (SST) episodes, and with decadal variability in the North Pacific Ocean as indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). ENSO teleconnections with precipitation in the western US are strong when SOI and NINO3 are out-of-phase and PDO is negative.

The specific combustion activity of supported PdO shows a persistent hysteresis between 450 and 750 degrees C, i.e., the rate of combustion between these temperature limits depends strongly on whether the catalyst is cooling from above 750 degrees C or heating from below 450 degrees C. This region is also notable for negative apparent activation energy in the rate of methane oxidation, i.e., the rate increases with decreasing temperature during reoxidation of the Pd metal and decreases with increasing temperature (especially with low oxygen partial pressure) prior to decomposition of the bulk oxide. Detailed time-temperature transient kinetic analyses were performed for supported PdO catalysts within the 450-750 degrees C temperature range.

Spatial patterns of primary production are in general determined by supply of macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate) from below the thermocline. Where the thermocline is shallow and intersects the lighted euphotic zone, biological production is enhanced. In the eastern tropical Pacific thermocline depth is controlled by three interrelated processes: a basin-scale east/west thermocline tilt, a basin-scale thermocline shoaling at the gyre margins, and local wind-driven upwelling. These processes regulate supply of nutrient-rich subsurface waters to the euphotic zone, and on their basis we have divided the eastern tropical Pacific into seven main regions. Primary production and its physical and chemical controls are described for each.\n\nEnhanced rates of macronutrient supply maintains levels of primary production in the eastern tropical Pacific above those of the oligotrophic subtropical gyres to the north and south. On the other hand lack of the micronutrient iron limits phytoplankton growth (and nitrogen fixation) over large portions of the open-ocean eastern tropical Pacific, depressing rates of primary production and resulting in the so-called high nitrate-low chlorophyll condition. Very high rates of primary production can occur in those coastal areas where both macronutrients and iron are supplied in abundance to surface waters. In these eutrophic coastal areas large phytoplankton cells dominate; conversely, in the open-ocean small cells are dominant. In a 'shadow zone' between the subtropical gyres with limited subsurface ventilation, enough production sinks and decays to produce anoxic and denitrified waters which spread beneath very large parts of the eastern tropical Pacific.\n\nSeasonal cycles are weak over much of the open-ocean eastern tropical Pacific, although several eutrophic coastal areas do exhibit substantial seasonality. The ENSO fluctuation, however, is an exceedingly important source of interannual variability in this region. El Nino in general results in a depressed thermocline and thus reduced rates of macronutrient supply and primary production. The multi-decadal PDO is likely also an important source of variability, with the 'El Viejo' phase of the PDO resulting in warmer and lower nutrient and productivity conditions similar to El Nino. On average the eastern tropical Pacific is moderately productive and, relative to Pacific and global means, its productivity and area are roughly equivalent. For example, it occupies about 18% of the Pacific Ocean by area and accounts for 22-23% of its productivity. Similarly, it occupies about 9% of the global ocean and accounts for 10% of its productivity.\n\nWhile representative, these average values obscure very substantial spatial and temporal variability that characterizes the dynamics of this tropical ocean.

It is shown that the PDO can be recovered from a reconstruction of North Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies based on a first-order autoregressive model and forcing by variability of the Aleutian low, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and oceanic zonal advection anomalies in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension. The latter results from oceanic Rossby waves that are forced by North Pacific Ekman pumping. The SST response patterns to these processes are not orthogonal, and they determine the spatial characteristics of the PDO. The importance of the different forcing, processes is frequency dependent. At interannual time scales, forcing from ENSO and the Aleutian low determines the response in equal parts. At decadal time scales, zonal advection in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension, ENSO, and anomalies of the Aleutian low each account for similar amounts of the PDO variance.

The microstructure of the Pd and PdO particles was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The extent of phase transformation was measured via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Our results confirm the observation reported previously by Farrauto et al, (Appl. Catal, A: General 81 (1992) 227) that the decomposition temperature (TD) of the PdO exceeds the oxide reformation temperature by a few hundred degrees K. TEM images provide insight into the morphology of the particles during the PdO --> Pd phase transformation. This phase transformation is initiated at the surface and causes small domains of Pd metal to form on the surface of PdO. These small domains of Pd metal are easy to reoxidize upon cooling. However, complete transformation of the PdO --> Pd at T>1198 K yields single crystal metal particles that are harder to oxidize during cooling in air. Appreciable amounts of bulk oxide do not form on the transitional alumina supported Pd unless the sample is cooled below 873 K. The hysteresis in the reformation of oxide during cooling is related to strongly bound oxygen on the Pd surface that inhibits bulk oxidation, The relationship between bulk oxide formation and the reactivity for methane oxidation was also examined. It was found that reactivation of the catalyst occurred before significant bulk PdO had formed. Samples quenched during this reactivation process were examined by XPS and TEM, and no evidence was seen for any redispersion during the reoxidation of the Pd metal. Extensive surface roughening appears to result from bulk oxide formation, which may explain the higher reactivity seen after catalyst cool-down. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Adhesion kinetics were studied using TCPs and PCL films and revealed that the rate of chondrocyte adhesion began to level off after 6 h. Degree of HAC chondrocyte adhesion was studied on all the substrates after 8 h, and ranged from 47 to 145% of the attachment found on TCPS. The greatest number of chondrocytes attached to PGA and 67:33 PGTMC polymer films, and attachment to PCL and L-PLA films was statistically lower than that found on PGA (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between amount of chondrocyte attachment to the substrates and the substrates' water contact angle. Chondrocytes proliferated equally well on all the substrates resulting in equivalent cell numbers on all the substrates at both day 4 and day 7 of the culture. However, these total cell numbers were reached as a result of a 88- and 42-fold expansion on PDO and PLA, respectively, which was significantly higher than the Ii-fold expansion found on TCPS (p < 0.05). The greater fold expansion of the cells on PDO and L-PLA films may be attributed to the availability of space for cells to grow, since their numbers at the start of culture were fewer following the 8 h attachment period. This suggests that regardless of initial seeding density on these degradable polymer substrates (i.e., if some minimum number of cells are able to attach), they will eventually populate the surfaces of all these polymers given sufficient space and time.

On the contrary. the shape of the less intense M4,5N2,3N2,3 Auger peak, which implies only the Pd3d and the Pd4p core levels, does not change much between Pd and PdO. The maximum of the MNN Auger peak is measured at 242.8 eV and 240.5 eV for Pd and PdO respectively. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Non-methane emissions oxidation, such as C2H6, C3H8 and CO, are also inhibited by low SOx concentrations, but to a lesser extent than CH4 emissions. The mechanism for SOx inhibition indicates a 1:1 selective adsorption of SOx on PdO for palladium on a non-sulfating support such as SiO2. Deactivation is therefore very rapid. In contrast, palladium on sulfating supports, that is gamma-Al2O3, deactivate more slowly and can tolerate more SOx because the SOx is also adsorbed onto the carrier. The activation energy for methane oxidation is dramatically increased after SOx poisoning for all Pd catalysts, while the Arrhenius pre-exponential term is relatively constant, indicating a transformation from very active PdO sites to less active PdO-SOx sites. Platinum catalysts are considerably less active than Pd as evidenced by a much lower pre-exponential term, but are more resistant to deactivation by SOx. Non-methane hydrocarbon and particulate emissions standards for lean burn natural gas engines for the United States can be met with Pd catalysts. However, the non-enforced methane emissions standards are not met. For the European truck test cycle, methane emissions standards are met since the test cycle heavily weights the hotter modes where Pd-SOx is sufficiently active.

Several studies have shown that climate changes over the latter part of the 20th century affected the phenology and population dynamics of single species. However, the key limitation to forecasting the effects of changing climate on ecosystems lies in understanding how it will affect interactions among species. We investigated the effects of climatic and biotic drivers on physical and biological lake processes, using a historical dataset of 40 years from Lake Washington, USA, and dynamic time-series models to explain changes in the phenological patterns among physical and biological components of pelagic ecosystems. Long-term climate warming and variability because of large-scale climatic patterns like Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) extended the duration of the stratification period by 25 days over the last 40 years. This change was due mainly to earlier spring stratification (16 days) and less to later stratification termination in fall (9 days). The phytoplankton spring bloom advanced roughly in parallel to stratification onset and in 2002 it occurred about 19 days earlier than it did in 1962, indicating the tight connection of spring phytoplankton growth to turbulent conditions. In contrast, the timing of the clear-water phase showed high variability and was mainly driven by biotic factors. Among the zooplankton species, the timing of spring peaks in the rotifer Keratella advanced strongly, whereas Leptodiaptomus and Daphnia showed slight or no changes. These changes have generated a growing time lag between the spring phytoplankton peak and zooplankton peak, which can be especially critical for the cladoceran Daphnia. Water temperature, PDO, and food availability affected the timing of the spring peak in zooplankton. Overall, the impact of PDO on the phenological processes were stronger compared with ENSO.

The structure of the Pd species in Pd-SH-FSM before and after the reaction was well characterized by a combination of XRD, TEM, UV-vis, Pd K-edge XANES/EXAFS, and Pd L-III-edge XANES, and the results were compared with those of a amorphous silica-supported mercaptopropylsiloxane Pd(II) complex (Pd-SH-SiO2), unmodified FSM-16-supported Pd(OAc)(2) (Pd-FSM), and previously reported heterogeneous catalysts (Pd zeolite and Pd/C). The aggregation behavior of Pd species during the reaction greatly depends on the support. On Pd-SH-FSM after Heck and Suzuki reactions, Pd(II) species coordinated to the sulfur ligands were the main Pd species together with small Pd clusters as minor species, and the catalyst was reused without marked loss in the activity. On Pd-SH-SiO2, relatively large numbers of the Pd(II) species were converted to Pd clusters after the Suzuki reaction. On ligandless Pd-FSM, most of the Pd was aggregated to form Pd metal particles. The activity order of the recycled catalysts (Pd-SH-FSM > Pd-SH-SiO2 > Pd-FSM) indicates that the Pd(II) complexes on the sulfur ligands and possibly the small Pd clusters are more active than Pd metal particles. It is concluded that the sulfur ligands in the size-restricted mesopore are effective for preventing the aggregation of coordinated Pd complexes, and this results in high durability and recycling characteristic of the Pd-SH-FSM. The deactivation of the Pd complex via Pd aggregation was significant for the conventional Pd catalysts; [Pd(NH3)(4)](2+) complexes in Pd zeolite and PdO nanoclusters on Pd/C were changed to less reactive metal particles or clusters after Heck and Suzuki reactions.

It is found that fully reduced Pd is inactive and that the activity increases at 533 K until a plateau in activity is achieved when 6-7 ML of PdO have formed over the surface of the Pd crystallites. The maximum activity is identical to that for fully oxidized Pd. Examination of the PdO formed under reaction conditions and during oxidation in O-2 at 533 K reveals some differences. Temperature-programmed reduction in CH4 and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that the oxide formed under reaction conditions is largely crystalline PdO, whereas the oxide formed in O-2 is a mixture of amorphous and crystalline PdO. The crystalline form of PdO is found to reduce more readily than the amorphous form. It is observed that the low-temperature CH4 combustion activity of PdO can be enhanced by producing a small amount of metallic Pd on the surface of PdO. The metallic Pd is more effective than PdO for the dissociative adsorption of CH4. It is hypothesized that the products of CH4 adsorption on Pd, H-s and CHx,s (x = 3-1.), rapidly diffuse to the Pd/PdO interface and then reduce the PdO to Pd. The effects of metallic Pd cannot be sustained, though, under steady-state conditions, because the metallic Pd is oxidized back to PdO.

Since Pd is oxidized during methane combustion to PdO and PdO is required for high activity, it is of interest to understand the dynamics of Pd oxidation and the structure of the oxide formed as well as the dynamics of PdO reduction by H-2 and CH4. In the present study isothermal and temperature-programmed oxidation and reduction were used to probe the dynamics of the oxidation and reduction of zirconia-supported Pd. During uptake in oxygen, a monolayer of oxide is generated immediately, and upon further oxidation, the oxide forms a shell around a core of metal with thicknesses that increase with the oxidation temperature. The initial oxide is amorphous and subsequently transforms to crystalline PdO. The dynamics of Pd oxidation suggest that oxidation follows the Cabrera-Mott theory. Reduction of PdO by H-2 occurs in a shellwise manner, consistent with a shrinking core mechanism, while reduction in CH4 occurs via an autocatalytic, nucleation mechanism. In the latter case, small particles of Pd must first be formed on which CH4 can dissociate. The fragments (H and CHx (x = 3-1)) diffuse to the metal-oxide boundary where reduction of the oxide occurs. Consistent with this picture, the kinetics of PdO reduction are first order in Pd initially, but then they become zero Order in Pd.

Initial exposure of Pd(lll) to O-2 at temperatures between 300 and 575 K resulted in a (2 x 2) structure observable by both LEED and STM. The maximum coverage achieved by O-2 exposure at 300 K was 0.25 ML. By increasing the temperature above 500 K, the oxygen coverage could be increased to 0.37 ML. To increase the oxygen coverage further, NO2 was used as the oxidant. On Pd(111), NO2 dissociatively adsorbs, with NO going to the gas phase below 500 K, leaving oxygen on the surface. Above 500 K, initial exposure of NO2 to Pd(111) also produced the (2 x 2) structure. Increasing the oxygen coverage to between 1.0 and 2.2 ML resulted in a complicated LEED pattern. This pattern could be explained as the superposition of three equivalent domains of two surface structures: one with a square surface lattice rotated 15 degrees with respect to Pd[110], the other with a rectangular surface lattice with the short sides of the rectangles parallel to Pd[110]. In STM movies, ad-islands and peninsulas were observed to nucleate and grow as the oxygen coverage reached this regime. The rectangular structure was observed on the original Pd(lll) terraces, and the square structure on the islands and peninsulas. This suggested that when the oxygen coverage exceeds 0.25 ML, oxygen atoms penetrate the surface creating a rectangular structure with a lower Pd atom density than the clean surface; the liberated Pd atoms, along with oxygen, then form the islands and peninsulas. The lattice constants obtained from the STM images were 0.679+/-0.012 nm for the square structure and 0.394+/-0.008 nm and 0.638+/-0.022 nm for the rectangular structure, both consistent with LEED observations. Neither of these structures can be simply related to any crystal orientation of Pd or PdO, indicating that there are states intermediate between Pd and PdO. After further increasing the oxygen coverage, the complicated LEED patterns became faint and a low temperature shoulder attributed to PdO decomposition developed in TPD traces. The results indicate that Pd(lll) oxidation proceeds through three stages involving four distinct surface states. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of \"unexpected\" events-that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic-on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily. decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics.

Dendrimer-encapsulated Pd nanoparticles undergo oxidation in air, but this process is slowed significantly when coordinating ions are removed from solution. In the absence of O-2, dendrimer-encapsulated Pd nanoparticles are stable indefinitely. The oxidation product is not PdO, but rather Pd ions coordinated to the dendrimer interior. Dendrimer generation does not affect the rate of Pd oxidation. The dendrimer itself undergoes irreversible oxidation in the presence of O-2. Finally, the oxidation of dendrimer-encapsulated Pd nanoparticles is reversible. Specifically, H-2 gas can be used to re-reduce partially oxidized Pd nanoparticles without changing their average size.", "ISSN": "0897-4756", "pub": "CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS", "volume": "15", "authors": ["Scott, RWJ", "Ye, HC", "Henriquez, RR", "Crooks, RM"], "issue": "20", "pages": "3873-3878"}, {"DOI": "10.1006/jcat.1996.0264", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002195179690264X/pdf?md5=69f6254d1804982ec08b5275bcb10e8b&pid=1-s2.0-S002195179690264X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 1996", "title": "Oxidation of volatile organic compounds on Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, and PdO/Al2O3 catalysts", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002195179690264X", "abstract": "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and oxidation (TPO) were used to study the decomposition and oxidation of methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid on Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, and PdO/Al2O3 catalysts. The oxidation and decomposition rates were much higher on Pd/Al2O3 than on Al2O3, even though the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were adsorbed on the Al2O3 support in both cases. The VOCs surface-diffused to Pd and mostly dehydrogenated during TPD whereas they oxidized to CO2 and H2O in the presence of oxygen. Partial oxidation products also apparently formed on the surface during TPO and they oxidized completely above 550 K. Above 600 K, VOCs oxidation was consistent with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation and reduction of Pd and PdO. On PdO/Al2O3 adsorbed VOCs were oxidized by lattice oxygen from PdO, but PdO was less active than Pd metal for VOC decomposition. Oxidation began at the same temperatures on PdO/Al2O3 whether or not O-2 was present, indicating that extraction of lattice oxygen from PdO was the limiting factor initially. After lattice oxygen was removed, metallic Pd decomposed VOCs and also adsorbed O-2, which was incorporated into the Pd lattice above 600 K. The reduction of PdO during TPD resulted in an autocatalytic oxidation since metallic Pd was more active than PdO. A portion of the VOCs reacted in parallel on Al2O3 since these sites are active for dehydration and dehydrogenation at moderate to high temperatures.

The evolution of El Nino off California closely followed the pattern observed in the tropical Pacific. In June 1997 an anomalous influx of warm southerly waters, with weak signatures on coastal sea level and thermocline depth, marked the onset of El Nino in central California. The timing was consistent with propagation from the tropics via the equatorial and coastal wave-guide. By late 1997, the classical stratified ocean condition with a deep thermocline, high sea level, and warm sea surface temperature (SST) commonly associated with El Nino dominated the coastal zone. During the first half of 1998 the core of the California Current, which is normally detected several hundred kilometers from shore as a river of low salinity, low nutrient water, was hugging the coast. High nutrient, productive waters that occur in a north-south band from the coast to approximately 200 km offshore during cool years disappeared during El Nino. The nitrate in surface waters was less than 20% of normal and new production was reduced by close to 70%. The La Nina recovery phase began in the fall of 1998 when SSTs dropped below normal, and ocean productivity rebounded to higher than normal levels. The reduction in coastal California primary productivity associated with El Nino was estimated to be 50 million metric tons of carbon (5 X 10(13)gC). This reduction certainly had deleterious effects on zooplankton, fish, and marine mammals. The 1992-1993 El Nino was more moderate than the 1997-1998 event, but because its duration was longer, its overall chemical and biological impact may have been comparable. How strongly the ecosystem responds to El Nino appears related to the longer-term background climatic state of the Pacific Ocean. The 1982-1983 and 1992-1993 El Ninos occurred during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO may have changed sign during the 1997-1998 El Nino, resulting in weaker ecological effects than would otherwise have been predicted based on the strength of the temperature anomaly.

Although superconductivity exists in alloy that contains the element Fe, LaOMPn (with M = Fe, Ni; and Pn = P and AS) is the first system where Fe plays the key role to the occurrence of superconductivity. LaOMPn has a layered crystal structure with an Fe-based plane. It is quite natural to search whether there exists other Fe based planar compounds that exhibit superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity with zero-resistance transition temperature at 8 K in the PbO-type alpha-FeSe compound. A key observation is that the clean superconducting phase exists only in those samples prepared with intentional Se deficiency. FeSe, compared with LaOFeAs, is less toxic and much easier to handle. What is truly striking is that this compound has the same, perhaps simpler, planar crystal sublattice as the layered oxypnictides.

Systematic dependences of the derived model parameters on the families are elucidated, many of which are understood from the systematic variation of the covalency between Fe-3d and pnictogen-/chalcogen-p orbitals. First, LaFePO, LaFeAsO (1111), (BaFeAs2)-As-2 (122), LiFeAs (111), FeSe, and FeTe (11) have overall similar band structures near the Fermi level, where the total widths of 10-fold Fe-3d bands are mostly around 4.5 eV. However, the derived effective models of the 10-fold Fe-3d bands (d model) for FeSe and FeTe have substantially larger effective onsite Coulomb interactions U similar to 4.2 and 3.4 eV, respectively, after the screening by electrons on other bands and after averaging over orbitals, as compared to similar to 2.5 eV for LaFeAsO. The difference is similar in the effective models containing p orbitals of As, Se or Te (dp or dpp model), where U ranges from similar to 4 eV for the 1111 family to similar to 7 eV for the 11 family. The exchange interaction J has a similar tendency. The family dependence of models indicates a wide variation ranging from weak correlation regime (LaFePO) to substantially strong correlation regime (FeSe). The origin of the larger effective interaction in the 11 family is ascribed to smaller spread of the Wannier orbitals generating larger bare interaction, and to fewer screening channels by the other bands. This variation is primarily derived from the distance h between the pnictogen/chalcogen position and the Fe layer: The longer h for the 11 family generates more ionic character of the bonding between iron and anion atoms, while the shorter h for the 1111 family leads to more covalent-bonding character, the larger spread of the Wannier orbitals, and more efficient screening by the anion p orbitals. The screened interaction of the d model is strongly orbital dependent, which is also understood from the Wannier spread. The dp and dpp models show much weaker orbital dependence. The larger h also explains why the 10-fold 3d bands for the 11 family are more entangled with the smearing of the \"pseudogap'' structure above the Fermi level seen in the 1111 family. While the family-dependent semimetallic splitting of the bands primarily consists of d(yz)/d(zx) and d(x2-y2) orbitals, the size of the pseudogap structure is controlled by the hybridization between these orbitals and d(xy)/d(3z2-r2): A large hybridization in the 1111 family generates a large \"band-insulating''-like pseudogap ( hybridization gap), whereas a large h in the 11 family weakens them, resulting in a \"half-filled'' like bands of orbitals. This may enhance strong correlation effects in analogy with Mott physics and causes the orbital selective crossover in the three orbitals. On the other hand, the geometrical frustration t'/t, inferred from the ratio of the next-nearest transfer t' to the nearest one t of the d model is relatively larger for the 1111 family than the 11 one. The models comprehensively derived here may serve as a firm starting basis of understanding both common and diverse properties of the iron-based superconductors including magnetism and superconductivity.", "ISSN": "0031-9015", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN", "volume": "79", "authors": ["Miyake, T", "Nakamura, K", "Arita, R", "Imada, M"], "issue": "4", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0256-307X/29/3/037402", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0256-307X/29/3/037402/pdf/0256-307X_29_3_037402.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 2012", "title": "Interface-Induced High-Temperature Superconductivity in Single Unit-Cell FeSe Films on SrTiO3", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0256-307X/29/3/037402/", "abstract": "We report high transition temperature superconductivity in one unit-cell (UC) thick FeSe films grown on a Se-etched SrTiO3(001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

Here we report the phase diagram for an FeSe monolayer grown on a SrTiO3 substrate, by tuning the charge carrier concentration over a wide range through an extensive annealing procedure. We identify two distinct phases that compete during the annealing process: the electronic structure of the phase at low doping (N phase) bears a clear resemblance to the antiferromagnetic parent compound of the Fe-based superconductors, whereas the superconducting phase (S phase) emerges with the increase in doping and the suppression of the N phase.

The others used granular Fe(0) and steel wool. The treatment cells significantly reduced concentrations of As, Mn, Mo, Se, U, V and Zn in groundwater that flowed through it. Zero-valent iron [Fe(0)], magnetite (Fe3O4), Calcite (CaCO3), goethite (FeOOH) and mixtures of contaminant-bearing phases were identified in the solid fraction of one treatment cell. A reaction progress approach was used to model chemical evolution of water chemistry as it reacted with the Fe(0). Precipitation of calcite, ferrous hydroxide [Fe(OH)(2)] and ferrous sulfide (FeS) were used to simulate observed changes in major-ion aqueous chemistry. The amount of reaction progress differed for each treatment cell. Changes in contaminant concentrations were consistent with precipitation of reduced oxides (UO2, V2O3), sulfides (As2S3, ZnS), iron minerals (FeSe2, FeMoO4) and carbonate (MnCO3). Formation of a free gas phase and precipitation of minerals contributed to loss of hydraulic conductivity in one treatment cell.

Since such waters are often anaerobic and rich in Fe2+ we investigated the long-term (<= 1 month) kinetics of selenite (Se(IV)O-3(-)) sorption to montmorillonite in the presence of Fe2+ under anoxic conditions. A synthetic montmorillonite was used to eliminate the influence of structural Fe. In the absence of aqueous Fe2+ selenite was sorbed as outer-sphere sorption complex, covering only part of the positive edge sites, as verified by a structure-based MUSIC model and Se K-edge XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy). When selenite was added to montmorillonite previously equilibrated with Fe2+ solution however, slow reduction of Se and formation of a solid phase was observed with Se K-edge XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine-structure) spectroscopy. Iterative transformation factor analysis of XANES and EXAFS spectra suggested that only one Se reaction product formed, which was identified as nano-particulate Se(0). Even after one month, only 75% of the initially sorbed Se(IV) was reduced to this solid species. Mossbauer spectrometry revealed that before and after addition and reduction of Se, 5% of total sorbed Fe occurred as Fe(III) species on edge sites of montmorillonite (approximate to 2 mmol kg(-1)). The only change observed after addition of Se was the formation of a new Fe(II) species (15%) attributed to the formation of an outer-sphere Fe(II)-Se sorption complex. The combined Mossbauer and XAS results hence clearly suggest that the Se and Fe redox reactions are not directly coupled. Based on the results of a companion paper, we hypothesize that the electrons produced in the absence of Se by oxidation of sorbed Fe(II) are stored, for example by formation of surface H-2 species, and are then available for the later Se(IV) reduction. The slow reaction rate indicates a diffusion controlled process. Homogeneous precipitation of an iron selenite was thermodynamically predicted and experimentally observed only in the absence of clay. Interestingly, half of Fe was oxidized in this precipitate (Mossbauer). Since DFT calculations predicted the oxidation of Fe at the water-FeSe solid interface only and not in the bulk phase, we derived an average particle size of this precipitate which does not exceed 2 nm. A comparison with the Mossbauer and XAS spectra of the clay samples demonstrates that such homogenous precipitation can be excluded as a mechanism for the observed slow Se reduction, emphasizing the role of abiotic, heterogeneous precipitation and reduction for the removal of Se from subsurface waters.

This approach seemed appropriate considering the small values of the magnetic moments in the parent compounds and the clear evidence based on photoemission experiments of the required electron and hole pockets. However, recent results in the context of alkali metal iron selenides, with generic chemical composition A(x)Fe(2-y)Se(2) (A = alkali metal element), have challenged those previous ideas since at particular compositions y the low-temperature ground states are insulating and display antiferro-magnetic order with large iron magnetic moments. Moreover, angle-resolved photoemission studies have revealed the absence of hole pockets at the Fermi level in these materials. The present status of this exciting area of research, with the potential to alter conceptually our understanding of the iron-based superconductors, is here reviewed, covering both experimental and theoretical investigations. Other recent related developments are also briefly reviewed, such as the study of selenide two-leg ladders and the discovery of superconductivity in a single layer of FeSe.

The pressure effects on the magnetic and superconducting transitions are discussed for different classes of doped and undoped FeAs-compounds: ROFeAs (R = rare-earth), AeFe(2)As(2) (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba), and AFeAs (A = Li, Na). Pressure tends to decrease the magnetic transition temperature in the undoped or only slightly doped compounds. The Superconducting Tc increases with low pressure for uderdoped FeAs-pnictides, remains approximately constant for optimal doping, and decreases linearly in the overdoped range. The undoped LaOFeAs and AeFe(2)As(2) become superconducting under pressure although non-hydrostatic pressure condition seems to play a role in CaFe(2)As(2). The Superconductivity in the (undoped) AFeAs is explained as a chemical pressure effect due to the Volume contraction caused by the small ionic size of the A-elements. The binary FeSe shows the largest pressure coefficient of Tc in the Se-deficient superconducting phase. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous investigations have demonstrated, however, that Se-IV and Se-VI are reduced by surface-associated Fe-II, thereby forming insoluble Sea and Fe selenides. Here we show that the mixed Fe-II/III (hydr)oxides green rust and magnetite, and the Fe-II sulfide mackinawite reduce selenite rapidly (< 1 day) to FeSe, while the slightly slower reduction by the Fe-II carbonate siderite produces elemental Se. In the case of mackinawite, both S-II and Fe-II surface atoms are oxidized at a ratio of one to four by producing a defective mackinawite Surface. Comparison of these spectroscopic results with thermodynamic equilibrium modeling provides evidence that the nature of reduction end product in these Fe-II systems is controlled by the concentration of HSe-: Se-0 forms only at lower HSe- concentrations related to slower HSeO3- reduction kinetics. Even under thermodynamically unstable conditions, the initially formed Se solid phases may remain stable for longer periods since their low solubility prevents the dissolution required for a phase transformation into more stable solids. The reduction by Fe2+ montmorillonite is generally much slower and restricted to a pH range, where selenite is adsorbed (pH<7), stressing the importance of a heterogeneous, surface-enhanced electron transfer reaction. Although the solids precipitated by the redox reaction are nanocrystalline, their solubility remains below 6.3 x 10(-8) M. No evidence for aqueous metal selenide colloids nor for Se sorption to colloidal phases was found. Since Fe-II phases like the ones investigated here should be ubiquitous ill the near field of nuclear waste disposals as well as in the surrounding aquifers, mobility of the fission product Se-79 may be much lower than previously assumed.

Normal respiratory epithelial MCC is an important host defense mechanism that is dependent on proper ciliary beating and the biological properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL). The role that tobacco smoke exposure plays as an inhibitor of MCC has yet to be elucidated. The present study investigates the consequences of cigarette smoke exposure on ciliary function and transepithelial chloride (Cl(-)) secretion, a major determinant of ASL.\n\nStudy Design: In vitro investigation.\n\nMethods: Well-characterized primary murine nasal septal epithehal (MNSE) and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cultures were exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and compared to control cultures. Effects on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and Cl(-) secretion were investigated using pharmacologic manipulation.\n\nResults: Change in forskolin-stimulated current (AISC), representing transepithelial Cl(-) secretion, was significantly decreased in CSC exposed MNSE (14.97 +/- 1.2 mu A/cm(2) vs. control, 19.1 +/- 1.56 mu A/cm(2) [P = .04]) and HSNE (2.68 0.79 mu A/cm(2) VS. control, 10.8 +/- 1.73 mu A/cm(2)) cultures (P = .001). Forskolin-stimulated CBF was also significantly reduced when acutely exposed to CSC (5.64 +/- 0.06 Hz vs. control 7.15 +/- 0.18 Hz).\n\nConclusions: The present study provides direct evidence that tobacco smoke diminishes two major components of MCC.

Comparison of the measured K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratios with the results of multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations indicates a significant increase of the 3d electron population (in relation to the pure metals) for Cr in CrSe (by 1.0 +/- 0.3) and for Mn in MnS (by 0.9 +/- 0.3). Our K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratio for Co in CoS does not show any significant change of 3d electron population. The only observed increase of the K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratio for Mn in MnSe indicates the decrease of the number of 3d electrons by 0.6 +/- 0.3. To explain evaluated changes of the 3d electron population for all the compounds, one can consider either rearrangement of electrons between 3d and 4s states of the metal or transfer of electrons from the 3d state of the metal to the ligand atom or vice versa. Although the sulphide compounds (MnS, CoS) show similar behaviour, the selenide compounds (CrSe, MnSe) show opposite behaviour which may be attributed to anomalous behaviour of rearrangement of electrons between the valence states of Cr as it happens in the case of free atom. The d-p hybridization effect which was not taken into account in our model theoretical calculation may be partly responsible for the increased K beta-to-K alpha ratio of Mn in MnSe and a comparison of the results for MnS and MnSe suggests that the nature of covalent bonding in MnSe is stronger than that of MnS.

When time-reversal symmetry is broken, the surface states are gapped, which induces a topological response of the system to electromagnetic field-the topological magnetoelectric effect. In this paper we study the behavior of topological surface states in heterostructures formed by a topological insulator and a magnetic insulator. Several magnetic insulators with compatible magnetic structure and relatively good lattice matching with topological insulators Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 are identified, and the best candidate material is found to be MnSe, an antiferromagnetic insulator. We perform first-principles calculations in Bi2Se3/MnSe superlattices and obtain the surface state band structure. The magnetic exchange coupling with MnSe induces a gap of similar to 54 meV at the surface states. In addition we tune the distance between Mn ions and the topological insulator surface to study the distance dependence of the exchange coupling.

We have also investigated Mn 3d partial DOS's in the valence-band regions of MnY by resonant photoemission experiments in the Mn 3p-3d core-excitation region. In order to interpret all features of the occupied and unoccupied Mn 3d DOS's including a multielectron satellite structure around -8 eV relative to the valence-band maximum, which cannot be explained by the one-electron picture, we have calculated Mn 3d-derived photoemission and inverse-photoemission spectra in terms of configuration-interaction theory with a MnY6 cluster model taking into account the Mn 3d-3d correlation energy and p-d hybridization explicitly. The Mn 3d DOS features at 0 to -6 eV including the main peak and around -8 eV are mainly attributed to transitions to d(5) (L) under bar and d(4) final states, respectively, while an intense peak in the IPES spectrum is due to transitions to db final states. The chemical trend of the occupied and unoccupied Mn 3d states is interpreted in terms of anion dependences of the ligand Mn 3d charge-transfer energy and p-d transfer integral, which decrease from MnS to MnSe and further to MnTe.", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "56", "authors": ["Sato, H", "Mihara, T", "Furuta, A", "Tamura, M", "Mimura, K", "Happo, N", "Taniguchi, M", "Ueda, Y"], "issue": "12", "pages": "7222-7231"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-4596(78)90107-X", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002245967890107X/pdf?md5=ab56fa7e6f27b0f6752141547036a93c&pid=1-s2.0-002245967890107X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1978", "title": "X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTRA OF MNS, MNSE, AND MNTE", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002245967890107X", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-4596", "pub": "JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY", "volume": "25", "authors": ["FRANZEN, H", "STERNER, C"], "issue": "3", "pages": "227-230"}, {"DOI": "10.1143/JJAP.17.371", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/1347-4065/17/S2/371/pdf/jjap_17_S2_371.pdf", "pubDate": "1978", "title": "MAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY, THERMAL-EXPANSION AND ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY OF MNSE\n", "DOIlink": "http://stacks.iop.org/1347-4065/17/371", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0021-4922", "pub": "JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS", "volume": "17", "authors": ["ITO, T", "ITO, K", "OKA, M"], "issue": "2", "pages": "371-374"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.2811713", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/apl/91/20/1.2811713.pdf;jsessionid=f2kdejhfpm02l.x-aip-live-03?itemId=/content/aip/journal/apl/91/20/10.1063/1.2811713&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/apl", "pubDate": "NOV 12 2007", "title": "Size dependence of nonlinear optical absorption and refraction of Mn-doped ZnSe nanocrystals", "DOIlink": "http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/91/20/10.1063/1.2811713", "abstract": "Nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear absorption coefficient of high-quality Mn:ZnSe nanocrystals are measured by z-scan technique at 800 nm wavelength.

To facilitate the analysis of the results-including those obtained in the wavelength region near the fundamental energy gap-we have modified the semiempirical single-effective-oscillator (SEO) model of n by introducing an additional term that explicitly accounts for interband transitions at the fundamental gap. Using the SEO model modified in this manner to fit the wavelength dependence of n, a set of semiempirical parameters was established for the above ternary II-VI-based alloys, where the fitting parameters for each alloy family are themselves expressed as functions of the alloy composition. The availability of these parameters makes it possible to calculate the index of refraction of any given II-VI ternary alloy for any composition and at any wavelength. Furthermore, these parameters provide valuable physical insights, such as the relationship between the covalency (or ionicity) of the material and its refractive index. In addition to its fundamental usefulness, this approach can-by appropriate extrapolation-also be used for obtaining the dispersion properties for \"hypothetical\" zinc blende compounds that do not form under equilibrium crystal growth conditions (such as MnTe, MnSe, or BeSe).

We demonstrate that a gapped ordinary bound state caused by the interface potential arises in the immediate region of the interface.

Ab initio structure solution from X-ray powder diffraction reveals the host compound CdSe center dot hda(0.5) (space group, Pbca, a = 6.8852 angstrom, b = 6.7894 angstrom, c = 27.4113 angstrom) is structurally analogous to CdSe center dot en(0.5), except for a subtle difference in alignment of aliphatic diamine ligands-the hda molecule deflects from the c axis and inclines toward the b axis. CdSe center dot L-0.5 shows well-defined UV absorption and emission peaks, which is attributed to a 2D exciton band edge transition due to size confinement effect in the c direction and the only photoemission level is the 2D exciton ground state with a long lifetime (7 mu s) and intrinsic line width (177 meV) at room temperature. When Cd2+ is partly substituted by Mn2+, a strong Mn2+-related luminescence peak at 2.12 eV (584 nm) is obtained at room temperature, which can be assigned to Mn2+ internal transition (T-4(1) -> (6)A(1)); its excitation peak overlaps with the photoemission peak of the 2D exciton ground state which indicates that the Mn2+ emission is driven by the 2D exciton ground-state transition.

When x < 0.05, the Mn2+ luminescence is a characteristic single-exponential decay process with a well-defined constant lifetime of 375 mu s.

We argue that such systems will typically have isolated surface bands with nonzero Chern numbers. If these overlap in energy, a metallic surface with large anomalous Hall conductivity will result; if not, a Chern-insulator state will typically occur. Thus, our search strategy reduces to looking for examples having the Fermi level in a global gap extending across the entire Brillouin zone. We verify this search strategy and identify several candidate systems by using first-principles calculations to compute the Chern number and anomalous Hall conductivity of a large number of such systems on MnTe, MnSe, and EuS surfaces. Our search reveals several promising Chern insulators with gaps of up to 140 meV.

The objectives of the present study were to investigate whether the polyphenolic compound resveratrol promotes transepithelial Cl(-) transport and inhibits KC/IL-8 secretion in sinonasal epithelium.\n\nStudy Design: In vitro and in vivo study.\n\nMethods: Transepithelial Cl(-) transport was investigated in primary murine nasal septal (MNSE) and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cultures. In vivo activity was also measured using the murine nasal potential difference assay. CFTR R-domain phosphorylation and cAMP levels were examined as a test of cAMP/PKA-dependent activation. In vitro LPS-induced KC/IL-8 secretion was quantified and compared to a panel of intranasal steroids.\n\nResults: Resveratrol(100 mu M) significantly increased CFTR-mediated Cl(-) transport (change in short-circuit current, DISC) in both MNSE (13.51 +/- 0.77 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.66 [control]; P < .05) and HSNE (12.28 +/- 1.08 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.32 [control]; P < .05). Cl(-) secretion across in vivo murine nasal epithelium was also enhanced (-4 +/- 1.8 vs. -0.8 +/- 1.7mV [control], P < .05). There was no increase in cellular cAMP or CFTR R-domain phosphorylation detected. Resveratrol also significantly inhibited KC/IL-8 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion (pg/mL) in MNSE (181 +/- 39[100 mu M) vs. 94 +/- 16 [200 mu M] vs. 16 +/- 22 [500 mu M] vs. 1195 +/- 355 [LPS control]; P < .001). The compound robustly abrogated KC/IL-8 secretion when compared to ciclesonide (765 +/- 139), triamcinolone (561 6 124), and budesonide (742 +/- 428), but had similar activity to fluticasone proprionate (65 +/- 47). Similar effects were demonstrated in HSNE (975 +/- 244 [100 mu M] vs. 1825 +/- 144 [LPS control]; P < .001) with inhibition comparable to fluticasone proprionate (785 +/- 277).\n\nConclusions: These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate resveratrol is a potent Cl(-) secretagogue and anti-inflammatory agent.

Further analysis revealed three additional open reading frames, nisF, nisE, and nisG, adjacent to nisK. Approximately 1 kb downstream of the nisG gene, three open reading frames in the opposite orientation have been identified. One of the reading frames, sacR, belongs to the sucrose operon, indicating that all genes belonging to the nisin gene cluster of L. lactis 6F3 have now been identified. Proteins NisF and NisE show strong homology to members of the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and nisG encodes a hydrophobic protein which might act similarly to the immunity proteins described for several colicins. Gene disruption mutants carrying mutations in the genes nisF, nisE, and nisG were still able to produce nisin. However, in comparison with the wild-type strain, these mutants were more sensitive to nisin. This indicates that besides nisI the newly identified genes are also involved in immunity to nisin.

Here, we have biochemically confirmed the observation that splicing regulation of the inhibitory GABA, receptor gamma2 (GABA(A)Rgamma(2)) subunit pre-mRNA exon E9 is disrupted in mice lacking Nova-1. To elucidate the mechanism by which Nova-1 regulates GABA(A)Rgamma2 alternative splicing, we systematically screened mini-genes derived from the GABA(A)Rgamma2 and human R-globin genes for their ability to support Nova-dependent splicing in transient transfection assays. These studies demonstrate that Nova-1 acts directly on GABA(A)Rgamma2 pre-mRNA to regulate E9 splicing and identify an intronic region that is necessary and sufficient for Nova-dependent enhancement of exon inclusion, which we term the NISE (Nova-dependent intronic splicing enhancer) element. The NISE element (located 80 nucleotides upstream of the splice acceptor site of the downstream exon E10) is composed of repeats of the sequence YCAY, consistent with previous studies of the mechanism by which Nova binds RNA. Mutation of these repeats abolishes binding of Nova-1 to the RNA in vitro and Nova-dependent splicing regulation in vivo.

This dynamics can reveal chemical and physical processes that take place on the femto- and picosecond time scale, which is faster than the time scale that may be probed by, for example, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A large number of chemically relevant processes take place on this time scale. Such processes range from forming and breaking hydrogen bonds and proton transfer to solvent exchange and vibrational population transfer.\n\nIn typical 2DIR spectra, multiple processes contribute to the waiting time dynamics and the spectra are often congested. This makes the spectra challenging to interpret, and the aid of theoretical models and simulations is often needed. To be useful, such models need to account for all dynamical processes in the sample simultaneously. The numerical integration of the Schrodinger equation (NISE) method has proven to allow for a very general treatment of the dynamical processes. It accounts for both the motional narrowing resulting from solvent-induced frequency fluctuations and population transfer between coupled vibrations. At the same time, frequency shifts arising from chemical-exchange reactions and changes of the transition dipoles because of either non-Condon effects or molecular reorientation are included in the treatment. This method therefore allows for the disentanglement of all of these processes.\n\nThe NISE method has thus far been successfully applied to study chemical-exchange processes. It was demonstrated that 2DIR is not only sensitive to reaction kinetics but also to the more detailed reaction dynamics. NISE has also been applied to the study of population transfer within the amide I band (Co stretch) and between the amide I and amide 11 bands (CN stretch and NH bend) in polypeptides. From the amide I studies, it was found that the population transfer can be used to enhance cross-peaks that act as structural markers for beta-sheet structure in proteins. From the amide I/II investigation, it was found that the amide II band and the hydrogen-bond stretch vibration are important parts of the relaxation pathway for the amide I vibration. With the development of simple approximations, it becomes possible to apply the NISE method even to very big systems, such as the OH stretch of bulk water, which can only be described well when large numbers of coupled vibrations are taken into account.", "ISSN": "0001-4842", "pub": "ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH", "volume": "42", "authors": ["Jansen, TLC", "Knoester, J"], "issue": "9", "pages": "1405-1411"}, {"DOI": "10.3891/acta.chem.scand.10-1440", "pdflink": "http://actachemscand.org/pdf/acta_vol_10_p1440-1454.pdf", "pubDate": "1956", "title": "X-RAY AND MAGNETIC STUDY OF NICKEL SELENIDES IN THE RANGE NISE TO NISE2", "DOIlink": "http://actachemscand.org/doi/10.3891/acta.chem.scand.10-1440", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0904-213X", "pub": "ACTA CHEMICA SCANDINAVICA", "volume": "10", "authors": ["GRONVOLD, F", "JACOBSEN, E"], "issue": "9", "pages": "1440-1454"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/c2cc38621f", "pdflink": "http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/cc/c2/c2cc38621f/c2cc38621f.pdf", "pubDate": "2013", "title": "NiSe2 as an efficient electrocatalyst for a Pt-free counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2013/CC/c2cc38621f", "abstract": "Nickel diselenide (NiSe2) has been synthesized and applied as a counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time, which displays remarkable catalytic activity in the reduction of I-3(-).

These statistics are obtained using validated, high quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface albedo (MOD43B3) data flagged as snow in the associated Quality Assurance (QA) fields. Near Real-Time Ice and Snow Extent (NISE) data are used as an additional discriminator of snow extent. Statistics are provided for the first seven MODIS bands, ranging from 0.47 to 2.1 mu m, and for three broadbands, 0.3-0.7, 0.3-5.0 and 0.7-5.0 mu m.\n\nThe statistics demonstrate that each ecosystem classification has a discernible spectral albedo signature when accompanied by snow on the ground. This indicates that winter canopy and the underlying surface radiative properties are impacted by the presence of snow overlying these surfaces. For example, the 0.47 mu m albedo of winter snow-free evergreen needleleaf forests increases from 0.03 to 0.36 in the presence of snow, compared to an increase of 0.04 to 0.76 for croplands. In general, the albedo of snow-covered ecosystems with some winter canopy has lower albedos than ecosystems with little to no winter canopy; for example the 0.47 mu m albedo of snow-covered mixed forests is 0.39 compared to 0.87 for barren/deserts and 0.95 for permanent snow.\n\nThese statistics can be used within land surface models in a stand-alone mode, to prescribe albedo values in atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs), or be incorporated into research and operational projects. They are intended to provide researchers with representative spectral albedo values of IGBP ecosystems in the presence of snow that are derived from validated satellite data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The existence of numerous alternative, non-homologous enzyme isoforms presents an interesting evolutionary problem; it also complicates genome-based reconstruction of the metabolic pathways in a variety of organisms. In 1998, a systematic search for analogous enzymes resulted in the identification of 105 Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers that included two or more proteins without detectable sequence similarity to each other, including 34 EC nodes where proteins were known (or predicted) to have distinct structural folds, indicating independent evolutionary origins. In the past 12 years, many putative non-homologous isofunctional enzymes were identified in newly sequenced genomes. In addition, efforts in structural genomics resulted in a vastly improved structural coverage of proteomes, providing for definitive assessment of (non) homologous relationships between proteins.\n\nResults: We report the results of a comprehensive search for non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISE) that yielded 185 EC nodes with two or more experimentally characterized - or predicted - structurally unrelated proteins. Of these NISE sets, only 74 were from the original 1998 list. Structural assignments of the NISE show over-representation of proteins with the TIM barrel fold and the nucleotide-binding Rossmann fold. From the functional perspective, the set of NISE is enriched in hydrolases, particularly carbohydrate hydrolases, and in enzymes involved in defense against oxidative stress.\n\nConclusions: These results indicate that at least some of the non-homologous isofunctional enzymes were recruited relatively recently from enzyme families that are active against related substrates and are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in substrate specificity.\n\nReviewers: This article was reviewed by Andrei Osterman, Keith F.

The goal of this paper is to perform such tasks in a distributed fashion, using data collected at power-limited sensors which either communicate with a fusion center (FC) over noisy links, or, communicate with each other over nonideal channels in an ad hoc setting. In FC-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with a prescribed power budget, linear dimensionality reducing operators which account for the sensor-to-FC channel are derived per sensor to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of Kalman filtered state estimates formed at the FC. Using these operators and state predictions fed back from the FC online, sensors reduce the dimensionality of their local innovation sequences and communicate them to the FC where tracking estimates are corrected. Analytical and numerical results advocate that the novel channel-aware distributed tracker outperforms competing alternatives. In ad hoc WSNs deployed to perform distributed tracking, one sensor broadcasts reduced-dimensionality data per time slot, according to a prespecified transmission order. The dimensionality reducing operators employed by the broadcasting sensor are selected to meet its transmit-power budget, while minimizing the state estimation MSE of the sensor with the lowest receiving SNR. Based on the received reduced-dimensionality data from the broadcasting sensor, every sensor in range performs the NISE optimal tracking. Corroborating distributed target tracking simulations based on distance-only observations illustrate that the novel scheme provides sensors with accurate estimates at affordable communication cost.", "ISSN": "1053-587X", "pub": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING", "volume": "57", "authors": ["Zhu, H", "Schizas, ID", "Giannakis, GB"], "issue": "8", "pages": "3193-3207"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00934-0", "pdflink": "http://femsle.oxfordjournals.org/content/231/1/85.full-text.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 9 2004", "title": "Distribution of the NisI immunity protein and enhancement of nisin activity by the lipid-free NisI", "DOIlink": "http://femsle.oxfordjournals.org/content/231/1/85", "abstract": "Lactococcus lactis cells producing the antibacterial peptide nisin protect their own cytoplasmic membrane by specific immunity proteins, NisI and NisF/E/G.

The diameter of the nanoneedle can be controlled by the size of NiSe source. The products were also characterized by XRD, HRTEM, EDS and PL spectrum. The ZnSe nanoneedles are of a single crystal in nature with high crystalline quality, and < 111 > is the preferential growth direction. A strong emission band around 438.9 nm is observed at room temperature, being attributed to the excitonic emission.

We analyzed plasma samples from 12 women 1-42 d after delivery of male babies and found that circulating fetal DNA was undetectable by day 1 after delivery. To obtain a higher time-resolution picture of fetal DNA clearance, we performed serial sampling of eight women, which indicated that most women (seven) had undetectable levels of circulating fetal DNA by 2 h postpartum. The mean half-life for circulating fetal DNA was 16.3 min (range 4-30 min). Plasma nucleases were found to account for only part of the clearance of plasma fetal DNA, The rapid turnover of circulating DNA suggests that plasma DNA analysis may be less susceptible to false-positive results, which result from carryover from previous pregnancies, than is the detection of fetal cells in maternal blood; also, rapid turnover may be useful for the monitoring of fete-maternal events with rapid dynamics.

Tn contrast dexamethasone, when given in the first or second week of gestation, has no effect on offspring insulin/glucose responses or hepatic PEPCK and GR expression, The increased hepatic GR expression may be crucial, since rats exposed to dexamethasone in utero showed potentiated glucose responses to exogenous corticosterone. These observations suggest that excessive glucocorticoid exposure late in pregnancy predisposes the offspring to glucose intolerance in adulthood, Programmed hepatic PEPCK overexpression, perhaps mediated by increased GR, may promote this process by increasing gluconeogenesis.", "ISSN": "0021-9738", "pub": "JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION", "volume": "101", "authors": ["Nyirenda, MJ", "Lindsay, RS", "Kenyon, CJ", "Burchell, A", "Seckl, JR"], "issue": "10", "pages": "2174-2181"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.78.224503", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 2008", "title": "Superconductivity close to magnetic instability in Fe(Se1-xTex)(0.82)", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.78.224503", "abstract": "We report our study of the evolution of superconductivity and the phase diagram of the ternary Fe(Se1-xTex)(0.82) (0 <= x <= 1.0) system.

To delineate the cellular sites of expression of IGF and IGFBP messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) in human placenta throughout pregnancy we used in situ hybridization histochemistry with S-35-labeled IGF and IGFBP complementary RNA probes on human placentas and fetal membranes of gestational ages 6 weeks to term (40 weeks). In placental regions where trophoblasts (fetal) or decidua (maternal) coexist (e.g. basal plate), the identity was delineated by their cytokeratin or vimentin immunoreactivity, respectively. Except for IGF-II, mRNAs encoding peptides of the IGF system were expressed in a similar spatial pattern and relative abundance throughout gestation. Both IGF mRNAs showed similar tissue distribution, but the IGF-II mRNA was more abundant than IGF-I mRNA at all gestational ages. IGF-II mRNA was expressed in the chorionic mesoderm of placental villi and chorionic plate in moderate abundance, and it decreased with gestation. It was also expressed in the trophoblasts of the cytotrophoblastic shell and Langhan's layer of placental villi only in the first trimester, suggesting an autocrine role for IGF-II in early cytotrophoblastic proliferation and/or differentiation. IGF-II mRNA was expressed most abundantly in the columns of intermediate trophoblasts in the anchoring villi and chorionic and basal plates. A gradient of IGF-II mRNA abundance was observed in the trophoblasts of the cytotrophoblastic column, with greater IGF II mRNA levels in those at the invading front, suggesting a role for IGF-II in trophoblastic invasion. In the fetal membranes, IGF-II mRNA was identified in the amnion and chorion laeve. IGF-I receptor mRNA was expressed in low abundance in all cell types of the placenta. All six IGFBP mRNAs were identified in variable abundance in the decidualized stromal cells of the maternal decidua basalis and parietalis, with IGFBP-1 mRNA being expressed in the greatest abundance. The spatial pattern of expression of each IGFBP mRNA also differed among decidual cells, with IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 mRNAs being expressed in most cells, whereas IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-6 mRNAs were expressed in only some cells. IGFBP-1 mRNA was expressed initially in the epithelium of endometrial glands and in a population of decidualized stromal cells in early gestation, and subsequently in the majority of decidualized stromal cells. IGFBP-3 mRNA was expressed in both the decidua and certain intermediate trophoblasts of the basal plate and anchoring villi of placenta and in amnion and chorion laeve of fetal membranes. IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 mRNA were expressed additionally in low abundance in the chorionic mesoderm. IGFBP-6 was expressed in greater abundance in the decidua parietalis than in decidua basalis, although the general level of expression was low. The spatial pattern and relative abundance of expression of IGFBP mRNAs suggest IGFBP-1 to be the predominant IGFBP synthesized by the maternal decidual cells, interacting with the IGF-II that synthesizes fetal intermediate trophoblasts.

Placental tissue produces pregnancy by modulating cytokines and hormones essential to the regulation of the fete-maternal unit. Decidual lymphocytes express cell surface markers for activation, such as CD69 and HLA-DR, and these cells secrete many cytokines. Recent studies suggested that in pregnant women, cytokines produced by cells predominate over those produced by Th1 cells, resulting in the maintenance of pregnancy. This review article focuses on the unique cytokine network at the fete-maternal interface in humans. Recently, we demonstrated that Th2 cells were dominant within the decidua in early pregnancy in humans. The Th2-derived cytokines, IL-4 and IL-6, induce the release of hCG from trophoblasts, and the hCG stimulate progesterone production from corpus luteum in pregnancy. Progesterone stimulates the secretion of Th2 and reduces the secretion of Th1 cytokines. Thus, Th2 type cytokines appear to contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy by controlling the immune and endocrine systems and promoting the function of trophoblasts at the implantation site.

These data suggest that the intrauterine environment plays a crucial role in determining later glucose homeostasis, but the mechanism is unknown. We have proposed that exposure of the fetus to excess maternal glucocorticoids may underpin the epidemiological findings. Normally placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 beta-HSD-2) protects the fetus from the normally higher maternal levels of glucocorticoids by inactivating corticosterone and cortisol to inert Il-keto products. Here we show that administration of carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of placental 11 beta-HSD 2, to pregnant rats, leads to a significant reduction in average birth weight (20 % fall). At 6 months of age, the male offspring of carbenoxolone-treated pregnancies had similar weights to controls, but showed significantly higher fasting plasma glucose (6.0 +/- 0.3 vs 4.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; p < 0.01) and exhibited significantly greater plasma glucose (10 % higher) and insulin (38 % higher) responses to an oral glucose load. These effects of carbenoxolone require intact maternal adrenal glands suggesting that inhibition of fete-placental 11 beta-HSD 2 is key.

AT2 expression was unaffected by maternal NR. Although 11 beta HSD2 mRNA was undetectable in term placenta, it was abundant in midgestation placenta and was lower after maternal NR (P < 0.001). There was close agreement between levels of 11 beta HSD enzyme (i.e. 11 beta -dehydrogenase and 11-oxoreductase) activities and abundance of 11 beta HSD1 mRNA and 11 beta HSD2 mRNA expression.\n\nThe persistence of tissue-specific increases in the expression of GR, 11 beta HSD1 and AT1 and decreases in the expression of 11 beta HSD2 in adrenals and kidney in newborn offspring in response to a defined period of maternal nutrient restriction during early to midgestation suggests that gene expression has been programmed by nutrient availability to the fetus before birth.

Maternal exposure is assessed relative to specific tobacco-related chemicals and the fete-placental impact of mutagenic products, in addition to nicotine replacement as a pharmacological intervention for smoking cessation. Important new information is being learned from clinical in vitro fertilization and assisted reproduction technologies regarding the effects of smoking on fertility. Present evidence supports an adverse effect of smoking on ovarian function which is prolonged and dose-dependent, whereas there appear to be more reversible effects on implantation and ongoing pregnancy. The anti-oestrogenic effect of smoking is reviewed in terms of direct effects of nicotine, cadmium and polyaromatic hydrocarbons on oestrogen synthesis and metabolism, oocytes and granulosa-luteal function. Innovative new models provide evidence that smoking may alter fertility through effects on uterine-fallopian tube functions which mediate gamete and conceptus transport. It is of interest that smoking is associated with a decreased incidence of uterine fibroids, endometriosis and uterine cancer, which may reflect inhibitory effects of smoke constituents on uterine cell proliferation and extracellular matrix interactions. The increased miscarriage rate among mothers who smoke may be related to direct adverse effects of nicotine, cadmium and polyaromatic hydrocarbons on trophoblast invasion and proliferation. In this respect, alterations in trophoblast differentiation along invasive or proliferative pathways may explain the changes in endocrine function and vascular morphology that are observed in smokers. In summary, significant advances are being made in the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the differential effects of cigarette smoking on reproductive tissues.

Emphasis has been placed on low birth weight infants who have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke in adulthood. Vascular pathology in adults is not always associated with low birth weight and animal experiments indicate that substantial changes in cardiovascular and endocrine function can result from maternal or fetal undernutrition without impairing fetal growth. Experimental investigation on organogenesis shows the pivotal role of adequate protein availability as well as total caloric intake. Amino acid metabolism in the fete-maternal unit appears to have a key influence on the development of organs involved in chronic degenerative disease in the adult. Experimental investigation has also highlighted the role of carbohydrate metabolism and its effect on the fetus in this respect. Either restriction of protein intake or diabetes in pregnant rats has intergenerational effects at least on the endocrine pancreas and the brain.

The ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure was performed by using high doses of inhaled halogenated agents to facilitate uterine relaxation during cesarean section, securing the fetal airway while fete-placental circulation remained intact, and then dividing the umbilical cord. A variety of procedures were performed during the ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure including bronchoscopy, orotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, tracheostomy with retrograde orotracheal intubation,tracheoplasty, removal of internal tracheal plug, removal of external tracheal clip, central line placement, and instillation of surfactant. There were minimal maternal or fetal complications during the procedure. This approach requires the coordinated efforts of pediatric surgeons, obstetricians, anesthesiologists, sonographers, and neonatologists. The combination of intensive maternal-fetal monitoring, cesarean section with maximal uterine relaxation, and maintenance of intact fete-placental circulation provides a controlled environment for securing the airway in babies with prenatally diagnosed airway obstruction.

Fete sampling programs for animal communities provide censuses, and usually some species in surveyed areas are not defected. Thus, counts of species detected underestimate the number of species present. We present estimators useful for drawing inferences about comparative species richness and composition between different sampling locations when not all species are detected in sampling efforts. Based on capture-recapture models using the robust design, our methods estimate relative species richness, proportion of species in one location that are also found in another, and number of species found in one location but not in another The methods use data on the presence or absence of each species at different sampling occasions (or locations) to estimate the number of species not detected nt any occasions (or locations). This approach permits estimation of the number of species in the sampled community and in subsets of the community useful for estimating the fraction of species shared by two communities. We provide an illustration of our estimation methods by comparing bird species richness and composition in two locations sampled by routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey. In this example analysis, the two locations (and associated bird communities) represented different levels of urbanization. Estimates of relative richness, proportion of shared species, and number of species present on one route but not the other indicated that the route with the smaller fraction of urban area had greater richness and a larger number of species that were not found on the more urban route than vice versa. We developed a software pack age, COMDYN, for computing estimates based on these methods.

Systematic dependences of the derived model parameters on the families are elucidated, many of which are understood from the systematic variation of the covalency between Fe-3d and pnictogen-/chalcogen-p orbitals. First, LaFePO, LaFeAsO (1111), (BaFeAs2)-As-2 (122), LiFeAs (111), FeSe, and FeTe (11) have overall similar band structures near the Fermi level, where the total widths of 10-fold Fe-3d bands are mostly around 4.5 eV. However, the derived effective models of the 10-fold Fe-3d bands (d model) for FeSe and FeTe have substantially larger effective onsite Coulomb interactions U similar to 4.2 and 3.4 eV, respectively, after the screening by electrons on other bands and after averaging over orbitals, as compared to similar to 2.5 eV for LaFeAsO. The difference is similar in the effective models containing p orbitals of As, Se or Te (dp or dpp model), where U ranges from similar to 4 eV for the 1111 family to similar to 7 eV for the 11 family. The exchange interaction J has a similar tendency. The family dependence of models indicates a wide variation ranging from weak correlation regime (LaFePO) to substantially strong correlation regime (FeSe). The origin of the larger effective interaction in the 11 family is ascribed to smaller spread of the Wannier orbitals generating larger bare interaction, and to fewer screening channels by the other bands. This variation is primarily derived from the distance h between the pnictogen/chalcogen position and the Fe layer: The longer h for the 11 family generates more ionic character of the bonding between iron and anion atoms, while the shorter h for the 1111 family leads to more covalent-bonding character, the larger spread of the Wannier orbitals, and more efficient screening by the anion p orbitals. The screened interaction of the d model is strongly orbital dependent, which is also understood from the Wannier spread. The dp and dpp models show much weaker orbital dependence. The larger h also explains why the 10-fold 3d bands for the 11 family are more entangled with the smearing of the \"pseudogap'' structure above the Fermi level seen in the 1111 family. While the family-dependent semimetallic splitting of the bands primarily consists of d(yz)/d(zx) and d(x2-y2) orbitals, the size of the pseudogap structure is controlled by the hybridization between these orbitals and d(xy)/d(3z2-r2): A large hybridization in the 1111 family generates a large \"band-insulating''-like pseudogap ( hybridization gap), whereas a large h in the 11 family weakens them, resulting in a \"half-filled'' like bands of orbitals. This may enhance strong correlation effects in analogy with Mott physics and causes the orbital selective crossover in the three orbitals. On the other hand, the geometrical frustration t'/t, inferred from the ratio of the next-nearest transfer t' to the nearest one t of the d model is relatively larger for the 1111 family than the 11 one. The models comprehensively derived here may serve as a firm starting basis of understanding both common and diverse properties of the iron-based superconductors including magnetism and superconductivity.", "ISSN": "0031-9015", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN", "volume": "79", "authors": ["Miyake, T", "Nakamura, K", "Arita, R", "Imada, M"], "issue": "4", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1093/molehr/3.8.655", "pdflink": "http://molehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/8/655.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "AUG 1997", "title": "Trophoblasts express Fas ligand: A proposed mechanism for immune privilege in placenta and maternal invasion", "DOIlink": "http://molehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/8/655", "abstract": "Cross-linking of Fas (CD95, APO-1) and Fas ligand (Fast; CD95L) induces apoptosis of Fas-bearing cells.

Many xenobiotics, including a number of clinically used drugs, are known to cause unwanted effects in the embryo or fetus, including in utero death, initiation of birth defects, and production of functional abnormalities. It is well established that numerous xenobiotics are not necessarily toxic as such, but are enzymatically transformed in the body to reactive and toxic intermediates. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are known to catalyze oxidative metabolism of a vast number of compounds, including many proteratogens, procarcinogens, and promutagens. About 20 xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP forms are known to exist in humans. Most of these forms are most abundant in the liver, but examples of exclusively extrahepatic CYP forms also exist. Unlike rodents, the liver of the human fetus and even embryo possesses relatively well-developed metabolism of xenobiotics. There is experimental evidence for the presence of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 in the fetal liver after the embryonic phase (after 8 to 9 weeks of gestation). Significant xenobiotic metabolism occurs also during organogenesis (before 8 weeks of gestation). Also, some fetal extrahepatic tissues, most notably the adrenal, contain substantial levels of CYP enzymes. The full-term human placenta is devoid of many CYP activities present in liver. Placental CYP1A1 is highly inducible by maternal cigarette smoking. Other forms present in full-term placenta include CYPLCB1 and CYP19 (steroid aromatase), which also contribute to the oxidation of some xenobiotics. At earlier stages of pregnancy, the placenta may express a wider array of CYP genes, including CYP2C, CYP2D6, and CYP3A7. Due to the small size of the fetus and low abundance of CYPs in placenta, the contribution of fete-placental metabolism to overall gestational pharmacokinetics of drugs is probably minor. In contrast, several toxic outcomes have been ascribed to altered metabolic patterns in the feto-placental unit, including a putative association between reduced placental oxidative capacity and birth defects. Examples of human teratogens that are substrates for CYP enzymes include thalidomide, phenytoin, ethanol, and several hormonal agents.

In addition to the proteinase inhibiting domain which is directed against polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) derived enzymes such as elastase and proteinase 3, SKALP contains multiple transglutaminase (TGase) substrate domains which enable crosslinking to extracellular and cell envelope proteins. Here we show that SKALP is constitutively expressed in several epithelia that are continuously subjected to inflammatory stimuli, such as the oral cavity and the vagina where it co-localizes with type 1 TGase. All epithelia from sterile body cavities are negative for SKALP. In general, stratified squamous epithelia are positive, whereas pseudostratified epithelia, simple/glandular epithelia and normal epidermis are negative. SKALP was found in fetal tissues of the oral cavity from 17 wk gestation onwards where it continued to be expressed up to adult life. Remarkably, in fetal epidermis SKALP was found from week 28 onwards, but was downregulated to undetectable levels in neonatal skin within three months, suggesting a role during pregnancy in fete-maternal interactions or in the early maturation phase of the epidermis. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the presence of SKALP in secretory vesicles including the lamellar granules. In culture models for epidermal keratinocytes we found that expression of the endogenous SKALP gene provided protection against cell detachment caused by purified elastase or activated PMNs. Addition of exogenous recombinant SKALP fully protected the keratinocytes against PMN-dependent detachment whereas superoxide dismutase and catalase were only marginally effective.

Here we present inelastic neutron scattering measurements from large single crystals of superconducting and non-superconducting Fe1+yTe1-xSex. These measurements indicate a spin fluctuation spectrum dominated by two-dimensional incommensurate excitations extending to energies greater than 250meV. Most importantly, the spin excitations in Fe1+yTe1-xSex have four-fold symmetry about the (1, 0) wavevector (square-lattice (pi,pi) point). Moreover, the excitations are described by the identical wavevector and can be characterized by the same model as the normal-state spin excitations in the high-T-C cuprates(9-11).

Stand ard chemotherapy M(C)OPP (nitrogen mustard (cyclophosphamide), vincristine, procabazine, and prednisone), ABVD (adriamycine, bleomycine, vinblastine, and dacarbacine) or M(C)OPP/ABVD +/- radiotherapy fail to achieve long-term complete remission in 35% to 50% of these patients. The BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) regimen was developed to improve treatment results by dose intensification achieved by reduced duration of treatment (time intensification) and addition of etoposide.\n\nPatients and methods: Thirty untreated patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease stage IIB-IV according to the Ann Arbor classification were treated with the time intensified BEACOPP regimen. Each patient was scheduled to receive eight cycles of chemotherapy with consolidating radiotherapy to sites of initial bulk disease and to residual tumor remaining after chemotherapy.\n\nResults: All patients were evaluable for assessment of toxicity, treatment response, freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) and survival (SV). Of 30 treated patients, 29 patients received the intended eight cycles of BEACOPP. One patient, in clinical CR, terminated the chemotherapy at his own request after six cycles and is at this time, 48 months after the end of treatment, in complete remission. Toxicity was tolerable with WHO grade 3/4 leucopenia in 28% of chemotherapy cycles and one severe (WHO grade 3) infection. No treatment-related death occurred. Cycles could generally be given on schedule. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in all but two patients (93%). At present, only one patient has relapsed. At a median followup of 40 months, FETE-rate is 89% (lower confidence limit: 80%). One patient died due to progressive disease.\n\nConclusion: The BEACOPP regimen is feasible at moderate hematopoeitic toxicity. With a FETE-rate of 89% at a median follow-up of 40 months, the treatment results are very encouraging.

DSC measurements exhibited an increase of the crystallization temperature of PP in the presence of fibers, but indicated no change in its percentage of crystallinity. DMTA spectra revealed an increase in the stiffness and a decrease of the damping with increasing GF content. The positions of the primary relaxations of PP and EPM did not change, but a significant broadening of the alpha-relaxation in the crystalline phase was observed, due to the induced reinforcement and interfacial interactions. The addition of PETF to PP enhanced its damping values at low temperatures and promoted the alpha-transition. The DMTA behavior was studied in dependence on the preconditioning and the frequency excitation. Heat treatment changed the characteristics of the beta-relaxation of PP, due to enhanced molecular motion of the polymer segments. The variation of frequency affected the secondary relaxations considerably and, in the presence of GF, the glass transitions. For the different relaxations, activation energies from peak shift and loss peak areas were determined. Experimental data of loss peaks were fitted to phenomenological equations.

Previous studies have pointed out a role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) metabolism. Here, we have analyzed the incorporation of Fete clusters into yeast ferredoxin imported into isolated energized mitochondria from cells grown in the presence of glycerol, an obligatory respiratory carbon source. Similar amounts of apo-ferredoxin precursor were imported into mitochondria and processed in wild-type and yfh1-deleted (DeltaYF111) strains. However, the incorporation of Fe-S clusters into apo-ferredoxin was significantly reduced in DeltaYFH1 mitochondria. The newly assembled ferredoxin was stable, excluding the possibility that the decreased incorporation was a result of increased oxidative damage. When DeltaYFH1 cells-were grown in raffinose medium, the formation of holo-ferredoxin was low, as a consequence of the decrease in ferredoxin precursor import into mitochondria. However, the decrease in the conversion rate of apo- into holo-ferredoxin was in the same range as for glycerol-grown cells, indicating that the extent of the defect in Fe-S protein assembly is similar under different physiological conditions. These data show that frataxin is not essential for Fe-S protein assembly, but improves the efficiency of the process. The large variations observed in the activity of Fete cluster proteins under different physiological conditions result from secondary defects in the physiology of DeltaYFH1 cells.", "ISSN": "0964-6906", "pub": "HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS", "volume": "11", "authors": ["Duby, G", "Foury, F", "Ramazzotti, A", "Herrmann, J", "Lutz, T"], "issue": "21", "pages": "2635-2643"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 2000", "title": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression during mouse development", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "\nFete-maternal transfer of lipophilic nutrients is an important factor in the normal development of the fetus and may be mediated by lipoproteins as carriers of these nutrients. Two proteins that map be important in this process are apolipoprotein B (apoB, the major structural protein of secreted lipoproteins) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) whose normal activity is required for the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Although no abnormalities of conception and embryonic lethality are known in humans who inherit genetic deficiencies of either of these proteins, homozygous mice bearing knockouts of either apoB or MTP show early embryonic lethality. To characterize the ontogeny of MTP expression during embryonic mouse development,we have used in situ hybridization to characterize the pattern of expression, By using microwave heating of tissue sections to optimize hybridization, we show that there is robust MTP expression in the yolk sac tissues followed by expression in the primordial liver cell nests as early as day 9 post-coitum (E9.5). Intestinal expression is detected around E12.5 and attains full adult expression patterns by E14.5. No expression in any other tissues was observed, including developing heart, kidney, placenta, and maternal decidua.

To describe the expression of JAGGED1 during human embryogenesis and to study its relationship with all the features of AGS, we performed in situ hybridization studies on human embryos and fetal tissue sections. JAGGED1 was mainly expressed in the cardiovascular system. In the liver, JAGGED1 transcripts were only detected in blood vessels. JAGGED1 was also expressed in other structures of mesenchymal origin (distal mesenchyme of limb buds; mesonephric and metanephric tubules of the kidney) and in epithelial structures including the ciliary margin of the retina and the posterior part of the lens, the ventral epithelium of the otic vesicle, the neurosensory epithelium of the ear vestibule, the epithelium of pharyngeal arches, and the developing central nervous system. The strong JAGGED1 expression during human embryo- and fete-genesis both in the vascular system and in other mesenchymal and epithelial tissues implicates abnormal angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of Alagille syndrome and particularly the paucity of interlobular bile ducts.

Abortions can be prevented by a second population of V gamma1.1 delta6.3 cells, which infiltrate on day 8.5 of gestation, and produce the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and Th3 cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2. In low abortion rate immunocompetent mice, most of the TGF-beta2 is derived from gamma delta T cells. However, TGF-beta2-producing cells are present in the decidua of pregnant severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice, which lack gamma delta T cells.\n\nMETHODS: The cells in day 13.5 decidua of CBA x DBA/2 matings and SCID x SCID matings were identified using flow cytometry and combined surface staining for gamma delta and/r asialoGM1, and intracellular cytokine staining for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta2,3.\n\nRESULTS: TGF-beta2 and TNF-alpha were found in asialoGM1(+) NK cells in SCID mouse decidua. In CBA x DBA/2 mated mice, two major and one minor subsets of cytokine-positive cells were identified: -gamma delta -only T cells, double positive asialoGM1(+gamma delta+) (NK-gamma delta T) cells, and a small number of asialoGM1(+) gamma delta- NK-only cells. The NK-only and NK-gamma delta T subsets showed a greater Th1/Th2,3 pattern of intracellular staining compared with the gamma delta -only subset. In the CBA x DBA/2 and SCID x SCID systems, Th1/Th2,3 ratios could not predict actual observed abortion rates but did correlate with susceptibility to abortions (if exposed to an additional stimulus such as stress). The known effect of in vivo administration of anti-asialoGM1 antibody on abortion rates within groups of mice exposed to such stresses could also be predicted.\n\nCONCLUSION: gamma delta (+) cells in decidua (e.g. V gamma1(+) cells which can recognize trophoblasts) differ based on the presence or absence of the NK marker-asialo-GM1. NK-gamma delta T cells may be quite important in the Th1 response in early pregnancy that predisposes to abortions in CBA x DBA/2 matings, whereas gamma delta T-only cells appear to be protective. In pregnant SCID mice, the TNF-alpha (+)/TGF-beta2(+) NK population is greatly expanded. An activating stimulus (such as stress or endotoxin) appears to be as important in triggering abortions, as is the Th1/Th2,3 ratio at the fete-maternal interface.", "ISSN": "8755-8920", "pub": "AMERICAN JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY", "volume": "45", "authors": ["Clark, DA", "Croitoru, K"], "issue": "5", "pages": "257-265"}, {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.081540898", "pdflink": "http://www.pnas.org/content/98/8/4522.full.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 10 2001", "title": "Roles for genomic imprinting and the zygotic genome in placental development", "DOIlink": "http://www.pnas.org/content/98/8/4522", "abstract": "The placenta contains several types of fete-maternal interfaces where zygote-derived cells interact with maternal cells or maternal blood for the promotion of fetal growth and viability. The genetic factors regulating the interactions between different cell types within fetomaternal interfaces and the relative contributions of the maternal and zygotic genomes are poorly understood. Genomic imprinting, the epigenetic process responsible for parental origin-dependent functional differences between homologous chromosomes, has been proposed to contribute to these events. Previous studies showed that mouse conceptuses with an absence of imprinted differences between the two copies of chromosome 12 (upon paternal inheritance of both copies) die late in gestation and have a variety of defects, including placentomegaly. Here we examined the role of chromosome 12 imprinting in these placentae in more detail. We show that the spatial interactions between different cell types within fetomaternal interfaces are defective and identify abnormal behaviors in both zygote-derived and maternal cells that are attributed to the genome of the zygote but not the mother. These include compromised invasion of the maternal decidualized endometrium and the central maternal artery situated within it by zygote-derived trophoblast, abnormalities in the wall of the central maternal artery, and defects within the zygote-derived cellular layer of the labyrinth, which is in direct contact with maternal blood. These findings demonstrate multiple roles for chromosome 12 imprinting in the placenta that have not previously been associated with imprinting effects.

In the coldest portions of these objects, we propose that the major grain species include olivine ([Fe, Mg]2SiO4), orthopyroxene ([Fe, Mg]SiO3), volatile and refractory organics, water ice, troilite (FeS), and metallic iron. This compositional model differs from almost all previous models of the interstellar medium (ISM) by having organics as the major condensed C species, rather than graphite; by including troilite as a major grain species; and by specifying the mineralogical composition of the condensed silicates. Using a combination of laboratory measurements of optical constants and asymptotic theory, we derive values of the real and imaginary indices of refraction of these grain species over a wavelength range that runs from the vacuum UV to the radio domain.\n\nThe above information on grain properties is used to estimate the Rosseland mean opacity of the grains and their monochromatic opacity. We find that organics are the largest contributors to the Rosseland mean extinction coefficient at temperatures below their vaporization temperatures (similar or equal to 575 K in molecular cloud cores and 425 K in accretion disks), and that silicates and metallic iron jointly determine the Rosseland mean opacity at higher temperatures. At mid-infrared wavelengths, the computed monochromatic opacities are in approximate accord with the spectral characteristics of ''astronomical silicates.'' At low temperatures (<500 K), the position, strength, width, and contrast of the 10 and 20 mu m silicate vibrational fundamentals can be significantly affected by the opacities of organics and water ice. Strong silicate features are produced only when the average grain size is less than several tens of microns.\n\nThe spectral index beta of the grain opacity at long wavelengths shows marked variation. In particular, we estimate that it has a value of about 2.5 between 100 and 650 mu m and a value of about 1.5 between 650 mu m and 2.7 mm for submicron- to millimeter-sized grains, in rough agreement with spectral flux measurements of the ISM and some disks around young stars. In the latter spectral region, grain opacity is dominated by silicates, with important contributions also coming from troilite and organics. However, the low values of beta (similar to 0) that appear to characterize a few disks around young stars in the 650 mu m to 2.7 mm region may be the result of significant grain growth that has occurred in these disks (sizes greater than or equal to 10 cm). In a similar vein, existing-far infrared spectral data for the older, Vega-like objects are consistent with grain sizes on the order of hundreds to thousands of microns. We also find that the grain absorption coefficient at 1 mm wavelength lies within a factor of 4 of 5 x 10(-3) cm(2) g-l (of gas and dust) for a wide variety of grain shapes and for grain sizes ranging from submicron to several millimeters.

The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art of tidal modelling and the progress achieved during this past decade.

In the following sections, we introduce the FES2004 tidal atlas and validate the model against in situ and satellite data. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the FES2004 release compared to earlier FES tidal atlases, and we recommend its use in tidal applications. The final section focuses on the new dissipation term added to the equations, which aims to account for the conversion of barotropic energy into internal tidal energy.

Greatly increased penetration of photovoltaics into global energy markets requires an expansion in attention from designs of high-performance to those that can deliver significantly lower cost per kilowatt-hour. To evaluate a new set of technical and economic performance targets, we examine material extraction costs and supply constraints for 23 promising semiconducting materials. Twelve composite materials systems were found to have the capacity to meet or exceed the annual worldwide electricity consumption of 17 000 TWh, of which nine have the potential for a significant cost reduction over crystalline silicon. We identify a large material extraction cost (cents/watt) gap between leading thin film materials and a number of unconventional solar cell candidates including FeS(2), CuO, and Zn(3)P(2). We find that devices performing below 10% power conversion efficiencies deliver the same lifetime energy output as those above 20% when a 3/4 material reduction is achieved.

Deletion of the Azotobacter vinelandii nifS gene lowers the activities of both nitrogenase component proteins. Because both nitrogenase component proteins have metallocluster prosthetic groups that are composed of iron- and sulfur-containing cores, this result indicated that the nifS gene product could be involved in the mobilization of the iron or sulfur required for metallocluster formation.  In the present work, it is shown that NIFS is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing homodimer that catalyzes the formation of L-alanine and elemental sulfur by using L-cysteine as substrate. NIFS activity is extremely sensitive to thiol-specific alkylating reagents, which indicates the participation of a cysteinyl thiolate at the active site. Based on these results we propose that an enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide that requires the release of the sulfur from the substrate L-cysteine for its formation ultimately provides the inorganic sulfide required for nitrogenase metallocluster formation. The recent discovery of nifS-like genes in non-nitrogen-fixing organisms also raises the possibility that the reaction catalyzed by NIFS represents a universal mechanism that involves pyridoxal phosphate chemistry, in the mobilization of the sulfur required for metallocluster formation.", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "pub": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "volume": "90", "authors": ["ZHENG, LM", "WHITE, RH", "CASH, VL", "JACK, RF", "DEAN, DR"], "issue": "7", "pages": "2754-2758"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0168-6496(03)00028-X", "pdflink": "http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/139.full-text.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 15 2003", "title": "Microbial communities in acid mine drainage", "DOIlink": "http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/139", "abstract": "The dissolution of sulfide minerals such as pyrite (FeS2), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), sphalerite (ZnS), and marcasite (FeS2) yields hot, sulfuric acid-rich solutions that contain high concentrations of toxic metals. In locations where access of oxidants to sulfide mineral surfaces is increased by mining, the resulting acid mine drainage (AMD) may contaminate surrounding ecosystems. Communities of autotrophic and heterotrophic archaea and bacteria catalyze iron and sulfur oxidation, thus may ultimately determine the rate of release of metals and sulfur to the environment. AMD communities contain fewer prokaryotic lineages than many other environments. However, it is notable that at least two archaeal and eight bacterial divisions have representatives able to thrive under the extreme conditions typical of AMD. AMD communities are characterized by a very limited number of distinct species, probably due to the small number of metabolically beneficial reactions available. The metabolisms that underpin these communities include organoheterotrophy and autotrophic iron and sulfur oxidation. Other metabolic activity is based on anaerobic sulfur oxidation and ferric iron reduction. Evidence for physiological synergy in iron, sulfur, and carbon flow in these communities is reviewed.

This paper describes apparatus that can be used in the evolution of sulfide from sediments and a method for the analysis of the evolved sulfide and the liberated metal. The method was studied with respect to gas flow rate, digestion time, and acid concentration. Liberated and trapped sulfide was determined by a colorimetric method of analysis. Using the apparatus and conditions described in this paper, the colorimetric method of analysis is capable of detecting AVS at concentrations normally encountered with a recovery of sulfide of at least 90%. High precision is possible if this apparatus is used. The limit of detection of the method is approximately 0.01 mumol/g dry sediment. We added 6 M HCl to produce a final concentration of approximately 1 M for the release of the AVS and SEM from unheated samples.

This front occurred where hot(c. 150 degrees C), extremely reduced, alkaline, bisulphide-bearing, submarine seepage waters interfaced with the acid, warm (c. 90 degrees C), iron-bearing Hadean ocean. The low pH of the ocean was imparted by the ten bars of CO2 considered to dominate the Hadean atmosphere/hydrosphere. Disequilibrium between the two solutions was maintained by the spontaneous precipitation of a colloidal FeS membrane. Iron monosulphide bubbles comprising this membrane were inflated by the hydrothermal solution upon sulphide mounds at the seepage sites. Our hypothesis is that the FeS membrane, laced with nickel, acted as a semipermeable catalytic boundary between the two fluids, encouraging synthesis of organic anions by hydrogenation and carboxylation of hydrothermal organic primers. The ocean provided carbonate, phosphate, iron, nickel and protons; the hydrothermal solution was the source of ammonia, acetate. HS-, H-2 and tungsten, as well as minor concentrations of organic sulphides and perhaps cyanide and acetaldehyde. The mean redox potential (Delta Eh) across the membrane, with the energy to drive synthesis, would have approximated to 300 millivolts. The generation of organic anions would have led to an increase in osmotic pressure within the FeS bubbles. Thus osmotic pressure could take over from hydraulic pressure as the driving force for distension, budding and reproduction of the bubbles.\n\nCondensation of the organic molecules to polymers, particularly organic sulphides, was driven by pyrophosphate hydrolysis. Regeneration of pyrophosphate from the monophosphate in the membrane was facilitated by protons contributed from the Hadean ocean. This was the first use by a metabolizing system of protonmotive force (driven by natural Delta pH) which also would have amounted to c. 300 millivolts. Protonmotive force is the universal energy transduction mechanism of life. Taken together with the redox potential across the membrane, the total electrochemical and chemical energy available for protometabolism amounted to a continuous supply at more than half a volt.\n\nThe role of the iron sulphide membrane in keeping the two solutions separated was appropriated by the newly synthesized organic sulphide polymers. This organic take-over of the membrane material led to the miniaturization of the metabolizing system. Information systems to govern replication could have developed penecontemporaneously in this same milieu.

In this report we demonstrate that these two proteases can cleave proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells. Similarly to pituitary corticotrophs, PC3 expressed in processing-deficient BSC-40 cells cleaved native mouse POMC at the -Lys-Arg- sites flanking corticotropin. The -Lys-Arg- within beta-lipotropin was less efficiently cleaved to release beta-endorphin. Expression of PC2 together with PC3 resulted in efficient conversion of beta-lipotropin, as occurs in pituitary melanotrophs. Furthermore, coexpression of PC2 together with mouse POMC in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells resulted in conversion of beta-lipotropin to gamma-lipotropin and beta-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. Finally, the processing selectivities of PC3 and PC2 expressed together in BSC-40 cells were determined by using a series of mutant mouse POMCs containing all possible pairs of basic residues at certain sites.

These differences in behavior cannot be entirely attributed to thermodynamic relationships, but also reflect differences in ligand exchange reaction kinetics, and redox reaction pathways.\n\nPb, Zn, and Cd, which are generally pyritized to only a few percent of the \"reactive\" fraction, have faster water exchange reaction kinetics than Fe2+ resulting in MeS phases precipitating prior to FeS formation and subsequent pyrite formation, whereas, Co and Ni, which have slower H2O exchange kinetics than Fe2+, are incorporated into pyrite. Although Hg and Cu have faster reaction kinetics than Fe2+, both are incorporated into pyrite or leached from the pyrite fraction with nitric acid. Hg undergoes significant chloride complexation, which can retard reaction with sulfide, but can also replace Fe in FeS to form HgS, which can only be dissolved in the pyrite fraction. Cu2+ is reduced by sulfide and forms a variety of sulfides with and without Fe that can only be dissolved with nitric acid. Mn2+ does not form a MnS phase easily and is incorporated into pyrite at high iron degrees of pyritization (DOP).\n\nOxyanions of Mo and As are first reduced by sulfide. These reduced forms may then react with sulfides resulting in incorporation into pyrite. However, the oxyanion of Cr is reduced to Cr3+, which is kinetically inert to reaction with sulfide and, therefore, not incorporated into pyrite.

Four types of Fe-bearing solids, siderite [FeCO3], pyrite [FeS2], coarse-grained elemental iron [Fe-0], and fine-grained Fe-0, were assessed for their ability to remove dissolved Cr(VI) from solution at flow rates typical of those encountered at sites of remediation. Batch studies show that the rate of Cr(VI) removal by fine-grained Fe-0 is greater than that for pyrite and coarse-grained Fe-0. Results from column studies suggest that partial removal of Cr(VI)) by pyrite and coarse-grained Fe-0 and quantitative removal of Cr(VI) by fine-grained Fe-0 occur at rapid groundwater flow velocities. The removal mechanism for Cr(VI) by fine-grained Fea and coarse-grained Fe-0 is through the reduction of Cr(Vl) to Cr(III), coupled with the oxidation of Fe-0 to Fe(II) and Fe(III), and the subsequent precipitation of a sparingly soluble Fe(III)-Cr(III) (oxy)hydroxide phase. Mineralogical analysis of the reactive material used in the batch tests indicates that Cr is associated with goethite(alpha-FeOOH). These results suggest th at Cr(lll) is removed either th ro ugh the formation of a solid solution or by adsorption of Cr(III) onto the goethite surface.

Physical compartmentation from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things, hence inorganic matter with such attributes would be life's most likely forebear. We propose that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage site hydrothermal mound at a redox, pH and temperature gradient between sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(II)-containing waters of the Hadean ocean floor. The naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. The known capability of FeS and NiS to catalyse the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments, which furthermore restrained reacted products from diffusion into the ocean, providing sufficient concentrations of reactants to forge the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. The chemistry of what is known as the RNA-world could have taken place within these naturally forming, catalytic-walled compartments to give rise to replicating systems. Sufficient concentrations of precursors to support replication would have been synthesized in situ geochemically and biogeochemically, with FeS (and NiS) centres playing the central catalytic role. The universal ancestor we infer was not a free-living cell, but rather was confined to the naturally chemiosmotic, FeS compartments within which the synthesis of its constituents occurred. The first free-living cells are suggested to have been eubacterial and archaebacterial chemoautotrophs that emerged more than 3.8 Gyr ago from their inorganic confines. We propose that the emergence of these prokaryotic lineages from inorganic confines occurred independently, facilitated by the independent origins of membrane-lipid biosynthesis: isoprenoid ether membranes in the archaebacterial and fatty acid ester membranes in the eubacterial lineage. The eukaryotes, all of which are ancestrally heterotrophs and possess eubacterial lipids, are suggested to have arisen ca. 2 Gyr ago through symbiosis involving an autotrophic archaebacterial host and a heterotrophic eubacterial symbiont, the common ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The attributes shared by all prokaryotes are viewed as inheritances from their confined universal ancestor. The attributes that distinguish eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet are uniform within the groups, are viewed as relics of their phase of differentiation after divergence from the non-free-living universal ancestor and before the origin of the free-living chemoautotrophic lifestyle. The attributes shared by eukaryotes with eubacteria and archaebacteria, respectively, are viewed as inheritances via symbiosis. The attributes unique to eukaryotes are viewed as inventions specific to their lineage. The origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system and nuclear membrane are suggested to be the fortuitous result of the expression of genes for eubacterial membrane lipid synthesis by an archaebacterial genetic apparatus in a compartment that was not fully prepared to accommodate such compounds, resulting in vesicles of eubacterial lipids that accumulated in the cytosol around their site of synthesis.\n\nUnder these premises, the most ancient divide in the living world is that between eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet the steepest evolutionary grade is that between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.", "ISSN": "0962-8436", "pub": "PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "volume": "358", "authors": ["Martin, W", "Russell, MJ"], "issue": "1429", "pages": "59-83"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00289-0", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703798002890/pdfft?md5=f054bee66b06290be7dacaaf1403919b&pid=1-s2.0-S0016703798002890-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 1999", "title": "The relative effects of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity on the solubility of sulfide in mafic magmas", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703798002890", "abstract": "The sulfur contents at sulfide saturation (SCSS) of a basaltic and a picritic melt have been measured experimentally as a function of pressure and temperature from 5 to 90 kb and 1400-1800 degrees C, using piston-cylinder and multi-anvil solid media pressure devices. Three distinct regimes of oxygen fugacity were investigated, imposed by the use of Fe-100, Fe40Ir60, and Fe20Ir80 capsules. The compositions of quenched run products, including the S contents of the silicate glasses, were determined by electron microprobe analysis. Theoretical considerations suggest that SCSS values (in ppm) can be described by an equation of the form:\n\nA In[S/ppm](SCSS) = A/T + B + CP/T + In a(FeS)(sulfide)\n\nwhere A and B are functions of the composition of the silicate melt. This equation implies that SCSS is independent of fO(2) and fS(2), except insofar as these factors influence the nature of the sulfide liquid (hence a(FeS)(sulfide)). The experiments reported here confirm this. The SCSS of both the basaltic and picritic compositions are rather insensitive to temperature, but show a strong exponential decrease with increasing pressure. Consequently, a magma generated in equilibrium with residual sulfide in the mantle becomes under saturated in sulfide during adiabatic ascent. At low pressure, sulfide saturation should occur only after substantial crystallization, under closed-system conditions, or after significant modification via assimilation (e.g., of S-rich sediments).

The cells were tightly associated with the ferric hydroxides. Repeated serial dilutions of both enrichments resulted in the isolation of two axenic strains, ES-1 and ES-2. The cultures were judged pure based on (i) growth from single colonies in tubes at dilutions of 10(-7) (ES-2) and 10(-8) (ES-1); (ii) uniform cell morphologies, i.e., ES-1 was a motile long thin, bent, or S-shaped rod and ES-2 was a shorter curved rod; and (iii) no growth on a heterotrophic medium.

Quinol:cytochrome c oxido-reductase ('bc(1) complex') is not present. For various electron accepters (O-2, nitrate) and donors (formate, H-2, NADH, glycerol-3-P) isoenzymes are present. The enzymes show great variability in membrane topology and energy conservation. Energy is conserved by conformational proton pumps, or by arrangement of substrate sites on opposite sides of the membrane resulting in charge separation. Depending on the enzymes and isoenzymes used, the H+/e(-) ratios are between 0 and 4 H+/e(-) for the overall chain. The expression of the terminal reductases is regulated by electron accepters. O-2 is the preferred electron acceptor and represses the terminal reductases of anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, nitrate represses other terminal reductases, such as fumarate or DMSO reductases. Energy conservation is maximal with O-2 and lowest with fumarate. By this regulation pathways with high ATP or growth yields are favoured. The expression of the dehydrogenases is regulated by the electron accepters, too. In aerobic growth, non-coupling dehydrogenases are expressed and used preferentially, whereas in fumarate or DMSO respiration coupling dehydrogenases are essential. Coupling and non-coupling isoenzymes are expressed correspondingly. Thus the rationale for expression of the dehydrogenases is not maximal energy yield, but could be maximal flux or growth rates. Nitrate regulation is effected by two-component signal transfer systems with membraneous nitrate/nitrite sensors (NarX, NarQ) and cytoplasmic response regulators (NarL, NarP) which communicate by protein phosphorylation. O-2 regulates by a two-component regulatory system consisting of a membraneous sensor (ArcB) and a response regulator (ArcA). ArcA is the major regulator of aerobic metabolism and represses the genes of aerobic metabolism under anaerobic conditions. FNR is a cytoplasmic O-2 responsive regulator with a sensory and a regulatory DNA-binding domain. FNR is the regulator of genes required for anaerobic respiration and related pathways. The binding sites of NarL, NarP, ArcA and FNR are characterized for various promoters. Most of the genes are regulated by more than one of the regulators, which can act in any combination and in a positive or negative mode. By this the hierarchical expression of the genes in response to the electron acceptors is achieved. FNR is located in the cytoplasm and contains a 4Fe4S cluster in the sensory domain. The regulatory concentrations of O-2 are 1-5 mbar. Under these conditions O-2 diffuses to the cytoplasm and is able to react directly with FNR without involvement of other specific enzymes or protein mediators. By oxidation of the FeS cluster, FNR is converted to the inactive state in a reversible process. Reductive activation could be achieved by cellular reductants in the absence of O-2. In addition, O-2 may cause destruction and loss of the FeS cluster, It is not known whether this process is required for regulation of FNR function.

Application to basalts and gases from Kilauea volcano demonstrates that during ascent, S is depleted in the magma as a result of shallow effervescence, and the gases which are evolved are in equilibrium with the magma during fire fountaining.", "ISSN": "0016-7037", "pub": "GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA", "volume": "56", "authors": ["WALLACE, P", "CARMICHAEL, ISE"], "issue": "5", "pages": "1863-1874"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/jp0539223", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861679836/jpcafh-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 15 2005", "title": "Density functionals for inorganometallic and organometallic chemistry", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0539223", "abstract": "We present a database of 21 bond dissociation energies for breaking metal-ligand bonds.

We have also created databases of metal-ligand bond lengths and atomic ionization potentials. The molecules used for bond lengths are AgH, BeO, CoH, CoO+, FeH, FeO, FeS, LiCl, LiO, MgO, RhC, VO, and VS and the ionization potentials are for the following atoms: C, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, O, and V. The data were chosen based on their diversity and expected reliability, and they are used along with three previously developed databases (transition metal dimer bond energies and bond lengths and main-group molecular atomization energies) for assessing the accuracy of several kinds of density functionals. In particular, we report tests for 42 previously defined functionals: 2 local spin density approximation (LSDA) functionals, 14 generalized gradient approximation (GGA) methods, 13 hybrid GGA methods, 7 meta GGA methods, and 8 hybrid meta GGA methods. In addition to these functionals, we also examine the effectiveness of scaling the correlation energy by testing 13 functionals with scaled or no gradient-corrected correlation energy, and we find that functionals of this kind are more accurate for metal-metal and metal-ligand bonds than any of the functionals already in the literature. We also present a readjusted GGA and a hybrid GGA with parameters adjusted for metals. When we consider these 57 functionals for metal-ligand and metal-metal bond energies simultaneously with maingroup atomization energies, atomic ionization potentials, and bond lengths we find that the most accurate functional is G96LYP, followed closely by MPWLYP1M (new in this article), XLYP, BLYP, and MOHLYP (also new in this article).

Mineralogy was characterized by Rietveld refinement of X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The spatial distribution of As in the mine wastes (at several micrometers spatial resolution) was determined by electron microprobe analyses. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis indicates that As5+ is the dominant oxidation state in the mine samples, but mixed oxidation states (nominally As-0 and As5+) were observed in the Argonaut Mine waste. Non-linear, least-squares fits of mine waste EXAFS (Extended XAFS) spectra indicate variable As speciation in each of the three mine wastes: As5+, the Ruth Mine sample is sorbed on ferric oxyhydroxides and aluminosilicates (probably clay) in roughly equal portions. Tailings from the Argonaut Mine contain approximate to 20% As bound in arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and arsenical pyrite (FeS(2-x)Asx) and approximate to 80% As5+ in a precipitate such as scorodite (FeAsO4.2H(2)O); however, no precipitate was detected by X-ray diffraction or microprobe analysis, suggesting that the phase is poorly crystalline or has low abundance (total As in sample = 262 ppm). Roasted sulfide ore of the Spenceville Mine contains As5+ substituted for sulfate in jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)] or incorporated in the structure of an unidentified Ca- or K-bearing phase, and As5+ sorbed to the surfaces of hematite or ferric oxyhydroxide grains. Determination of solid-phase As speciation in mine wastes by XAFS spectroscopy is a valuable first step in the evaluation of its bioavailability, because the mobility and toxicity of As compounds vary with oxidation state.

In many sedimentary environments, a zone exists which releases H2S if treated with acid. The materials that produce this sulfide are described as acid volatile sulfides or AVS and the sulfide which is evolved and collected by this treatment is called acid volatile sulfide (AVS-S). In this research review we show that AVS represents part of a complex and dynamic biogeochemical system which is not defined simply by the analysis of AVS-S.\n\nDuring the 40 years since R.A. Berner first defined the concept of acid volatile sulfide, a number of scientific myths have developed regarding the nature and composition of AVS and its role in the global sulfur cycle. We show that:\n\nAVS is not equivalent to FeS and solid FeS phases have rarely been identified in marine sediments. AVS is a complex and variable component which does not represent any singular or simple group of sediment components.\n\nThe commonly used extraction methods do not quantitatively extract AVS minerals (mackinawite and greigite) without also significantly releasing sulfide from pyrite.\n\nAVS varies geographically and AVS is not the same component or set of components wherever it is found.\n\nThe solubilities of FeS and Fe3S4 in neutral to alkaline systems are presently poorly constrained and pore water saturation state calculations cannot be used to support the presence of specific AVS minerals.\n\nThe colored zone in sediments does not reflect the distribution of AVS.\n\nAVS is not always a minor fraction of total reduced sulfide (TRS) which dominantly occurs near the sediment water interface. AVS minerals are not required precursors for pyrite formation.\n\nA better understanding of the sedimentary sulfur system, including its nature, formation and transformations, is a key component in understanding the evolution of the Earth and its future development. However, some basic parameters, such as the solubility and composition of the metastable iron sulfide solids, are still not constrained. Even the presence of these minerals in most sedimentary systems remains equivocal. Aqueous FeS clusters appear to be ubiquitous and appear to have significant geochemical and biological roles. The roles of organisms, especially in modifying rates and products, remain a key area of research.\n\nAlthough AVS may have served its purpose in the earlier exploratory days of the study of sedimentary sulfides, the concept is now probably more of a hindrance than a help in advancing this field. It is reasonable to question if it is not time to simply do away with the AVS concept altogether and get on with the business of trying to deal more directly with the behavior of the more important components known to fall within the group of sulfide species that contribute to sulfide that is volatilized when acid is added to a sediment.

We examined the rates of superoxide generation (measured as hydrogen peroxide production) by rat skeletal muscle mitochondria under a variety of conditions. The rate of superoxide production by complex I during NADH-linked forward electron transport was less than 10% of that during succinate-linked reverse electron transport even when complex I was fully reduced by pyruvate plus malate in the presence of the complex III inhibitor, stigmatellin. This asymmetry was not explained by differences in protonmotive force or its components. However, when inhibitors of the quinone-binding site of complex I were added in the presence of ATP to generate a pH gradient, there was a rapid rate of superoxide production by forward electron transport that was as great as the rate seen with reverse electron transport at the same pH gradient. These observations suggest that quinone-binding site inhibitors can make complex I adopt the highly radical-producing state that occurs during reverse electron transport. Despite complete inhibition of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity in each case, different classes of quinone-binding site inhibitor (rotenone, piericidin, and high concentrations of myxothiazol) gave different rates of superoxide production during forward electron transport (the rate with myxothiazol was twice that with rotenone) suggesting that the site of rapid superoxide generation by complex I is in the region of the ubisemiquinone-binding sites and not upstream at the flavin or low potential FeS centers.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "279", "authors": ["Lambert, AJ", "Brand, MD"], "issue": "38", "pages": "39414-39420"}, {"DOI": "10.1029/1998RG000053", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAY 2000", "title": "High-pressure experiments and the phase diagram of lower mantle and core materials", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1998RG000053/abstract", "abstract": "The interpretation of seismic data and computer modeling requires increased accuracy in relevant material properties in order to improve our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the Earth's deep interior. To obtain such properties, a complementary method to classic shock compression experiments and theoretical calculations is the use of laser-heated diamond cells, which are now producing accurate data on phase diagrams, equations of state, and melting. Data on one of the most important measurements, the melting temperatures of iron at very high pressure, are now converging. Two other issues linking core properties to those of iron are investigated in the diamond cell: One is the melting point depression of iron in the presence of light elements, and the other is the structure of iron at the conditions of the inner core. First measurements on eutectic systems indicate a significant decrease in the melting point depression with increasing pressure, which is in contrast to previous predictions. X-ray diffraction measurements at simultaneously high pressure and high temperature have improved significantly with the installation of high-pressure \"beam lines\" at synchrotron facilities, and structural measurements on iron are in progress. Considerable efforts have been made to develop new techniques to heat minerals at the conditions of the deep mantle in the diamond cell and to measure their phase relations reliably. Even measurements of the melting behavior of realistic rock compositions at high pressure, previously considered to be impossible in the diamond cell, have been reported. The extrapolated solidus of the lower mantle intersects the geotherm at the core-mantle boundary, which may explain the seismically observed ultra low velocity zone. The diamond cell has great potential for future development and broad application, as new measurements on high-pressure-geochemistry at deep mantle and core conditions have opened a new field of research. There are, however, strict experimental requirements for obtaining reliable data, which are summarized in the present paper.

Although a comprehensive description of several techniques and approaches is given, most of this paper has been devoted to the so called axiomatic theories and related finite element implementations. Most of the theories and finite elements that have been proposed over the last thirty years are in fact based on these types of approaches. The paper has been divided into three parts.\n\nPart I, has been devoted to the description of possible approaches to plate and shell structures: 3D approaches, continuum based methods, axiomatic and asymptotic two-dimensional theories, classical and mixed formulations, equivalent single layer and layer wise variable descriptions are considered (the number of the unknown variables is considered to be independent of the number of the constitutive layers in the equivalent single layer case). Complicating effects that have been introduced by anisotropic behavior and layered constructions, such as high transverse deformabilty, zig-zag effects and interlaminar continuity, have been discussed and summarized by the acronim C-z(0)-Requirements.\n\nTwo-dimensional theories have been dealt with in Part II. Contributions based on axiomatic, asymtotic and continuum based approches have been overviewed. Classical theories and their refinements are first considered. Both case of equivalent single-layer and layer-wise variables descriptions are discussed. The so-called zig-zag theories are then discussed. A complete and detailed overview has been conducted for this type of theory which relies on an approach that is entirely originated and devoted to layered constructions. Formulas and contributions related to the three possible zig-zag approaches, i.e. Lekhnitskii-Ren, Ambartsumian-Whitney-Rath-Das, Reissner-Murakami-Carrera ones have been presented and overviewed, taking into account the findings of a recent historical note provided by the author. Finite Element FE implementations are examined in Part III. The possible developments of finite elements for layered plates and shells are first outlined. FEs based on the theories considered in Part II are discussed along with those approaches which consist of a specific application of finite element techniques, such as hybrid methods and so-called global/local techniques. The extension of finite elements that were originally developed for isotropic one layered structures to multilayerd plates and shells are first discussed. Works based on classical and refined theories as well as on equivalent single layer and layer-wise descriptions have been overviewed. Development of available zig-zag finite elements has been considered for the three cases of zig-zag theories. Finite elements based on other approches are also discussed.

Subcultures in defined mineral media with ferrous iron (10 mmol/liter, mostly precipitated as FeCO3) yielded enrichments of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria which used ferrous iron as the sole electron donor for photosynthesis. Two different types of purple bacteria, represented by strains L7 and SW2, were isolated which oxidized colorless ferrous iron under anoxic conditions in the light to brown ferric iron. Strain L7 had rod-shaped, nonmotile cells (1.3 by 2 to 3 mu m) which frequently formed gas vesicles. In addition to ferrous iron, strain L7 used H-2+CO2, acetate, pyruvate, and glucose as substrates for phototrophic growth. Strain SW2 had small rod-shaped, nonmotile cells (0.5 by 1 to 1.5 mu m). Besides ferrous iron, strain SW2 utilized H-2+CO2, monocarboxylic acids, glucose, and fructose; Neither strain utilized free sulfide; however, both strains grew on black ferrous sulfide (FeS) which was converted to ferric iron and sulfate. Strains L7 and SW2 grown photoheterotrophically without ferrous iron were purple to brownish red and yellowish brown, respectively; absorption spectra revealed peaks characteristic of bacteriochlorophyll a. The closest phototrophic relatives of strains L7 and SW2 so far examined on the basis of 16S rRNA sequences were species of the genera Chromatium (gamma subclass of proteobacteria) and Rhodobacter (alpha subclass), respectively. In mineral medium, the new isolates formed 7.6 g of cell dry mass per mol of Fe(II) oxidized, which is in good agreement with a photoautotrophic utilization of ferrous iron as electron donor for CO2 fixation. Dependence of ferrous iron oxidation on light and CO2 was also demonstrated in dense cell suspensions. In media containing both ferrous iron and an organic substrate (e.g., acetate, glucose), strain L7 utilized ferrous iron and the organic compound simultaneously; in contrast, strain SW2 started to oxidize ferrous iron only after consumption of the organic electron donor. Ferrous iron oxidation by anoxygenic phototrophs is understandable in terms of energetics. In contrast to the Fe3+/Fe2+ pair (E(0) = +0.77 V) existing in acidic solutions, the relevant redox pair at pH 7 in bicarbonate-containing environments, Fe(OH)(3)+HCO3-/FeCO3, has an E(0) of +0.2 V.

Although superconductivity exists in alloy that contains the element Fe, LaOMPn (with M = Fe, Ni; and Pn = P and AS) is the first system where Fe plays the key role to the occurrence of superconductivity. LaOMPn has a layered crystal structure with an Fe-based plane. It is quite natural to search whether there exists other Fe based planar compounds that exhibit superconductivity. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity with zero-resistance transition temperature at 8 K in the PbO-type alpha-FeSe compound. A key observation is that the clean superconducting phase exists only in those samples prepared with intentional Se deficiency. FeSe, compared with LaOFeAs, is less toxic and much easier to handle. What is truly striking is that this compound has the same, perhaps simpler, planar crystal sublattice as the layered oxypnictides.

Systematic dependences of the derived model parameters on the families are elucidated, many of which are understood from the systematic variation of the covalency between Fe-3d and pnictogen-/chalcogen-p orbitals. First, LaFePO, LaFeAsO (1111), (BaFeAs2)-As-2 (122), LiFeAs (111), FeSe, and FeTe (11) have overall similar band structures near the Fermi level, where the total widths of 10-fold Fe-3d bands are mostly around 4.5 eV. However, the derived effective models of the 10-fold Fe-3d bands (d model) for FeSe and FeTe have substantially larger effective onsite Coulomb interactions U similar to 4.2 and 3.4 eV, respectively, after the screening by electrons on other bands and after averaging over orbitals, as compared to similar to 2.5 eV for LaFeAsO. The difference is similar in the effective models containing p orbitals of As, Se or Te (dp or dpp model), where U ranges from similar to 4 eV for the 1111 family to similar to 7 eV for the 11 family. The exchange interaction J has a similar tendency. The family dependence of models indicates a wide variation ranging from weak correlation regime (LaFePO) to substantially strong correlation regime (FeSe). The origin of the larger effective interaction in the 11 family is ascribed to smaller spread of the Wannier orbitals generating larger bare interaction, and to fewer screening channels by the other bands. This variation is primarily derived from the distance h between the pnictogen/chalcogen position and the Fe layer: The longer h for the 11 family generates more ionic character of the bonding between iron and anion atoms, while the shorter h for the 1111 family leads to more covalent-bonding character, the larger spread of the Wannier orbitals, and more efficient screening by the anion p orbitals. The screened interaction of the d model is strongly orbital dependent, which is also understood from the Wannier spread. The dp and dpp models show much weaker orbital dependence. The larger h also explains why the 10-fold 3d bands for the 11 family are more entangled with the smearing of the \"pseudogap'' structure above the Fermi level seen in the 1111 family. While the family-dependent semimetallic splitting of the bands primarily consists of d(yz)/d(zx) and d(x2-y2) orbitals, the size of the pseudogap structure is controlled by the hybridization between these orbitals and d(xy)/d(3z2-r2): A large hybridization in the 1111 family generates a large \"band-insulating''-like pseudogap ( hybridization gap), whereas a large h in the 11 family weakens them, resulting in a \"half-filled'' like bands of orbitals. This may enhance strong correlation effects in analogy with Mott physics and causes the orbital selective crossover in the three orbitals. On the other hand, the geometrical frustration t'/t, inferred from the ratio of the next-nearest transfer t' to the nearest one t of the d model is relatively larger for the 1111 family than the 11 one. The models comprehensively derived here may serve as a firm starting basis of understanding both common and diverse properties of the iron-based superconductors including magnetism and superconductivity.", "ISSN": "0031-9015", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN", "volume": "79", "authors": ["Miyake, T", "Nakamura, K", "Arita, R", "Imada, M"], "issue": "4", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0256-307X/29/3/037402", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0256-307X/29/3/037402/pdf/0256-307X_29_3_037402.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 2012", "title": "Interface-Induced High-Temperature Superconductivity in Single Unit-Cell FeSe Films on SrTiO3", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0256-307X/29/3/037402/", "abstract": "We report high transition temperature superconductivity in one unit-cell (UC) thick FeSe films grown on a Se-etched SrTiO3(001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

It is therefore important to establish whether the superconductivity observed in the single-layer sheets of FeSe-the essential building blocks of the Fe-based superconductors-is realized by undergoing a similar transition. Here we report the phase diagram for an FeSe monolayer grown on a SrTiO3 substrate, by tuning the charge carrier concentration over a wide range through an extensive annealing procedure. We identify two distinct phases that compete during the annealing process: the electronic structure of the phase at low doping (N phase) bears a clear resemblance to the antiferromagnetic parent compound of the Fe-based superconductors, whereas the superconducting phase (S phase) emerges with the increase in doping and the suppression of the N phase.

Since such waters are often anaerobic and rich in Fe2+ we investigated the long-term (<= 1 month) kinetics of selenite (Se(IV)O-3(-)) sorption to montmorillonite in the presence of Fe2+ under anoxic conditions. A synthetic montmorillonite was used to eliminate the influence of structural Fe. In the absence of aqueous Fe2+ selenite was sorbed as outer-sphere sorption complex, covering only part of the positive edge sites, as verified by a structure-based MUSIC model and Se K-edge XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy). When selenite was added to montmorillonite previously equilibrated with Fe2+ solution however, slow reduction of Se and formation of a solid phase was observed with Se K-edge XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine-structure) spectroscopy. Iterative transformation factor analysis of XANES and EXAFS spectra suggested that only one Se reaction product formed, which was identified as nano-particulate Se(0). Even after one month, only 75% of the initially sorbed Se(IV) was reduced to this solid species. Mossbauer spectrometry revealed that before and after addition and reduction of Se, 5% of total sorbed Fe occurred as Fe(III) species on edge sites of montmorillonite (approximate to 2 mmol kg(-1)). The only change observed after addition of Se was the formation of a new Fe(II) species (15%) attributed to the formation of an outer-sphere Fe(II)-Se sorption complex. The combined Mossbauer and XAS results hence clearly suggest that the Se and Fe redox reactions are not directly coupled. Based on the results of a companion paper, we hypothesize that the electrons produced in the absence of Se by oxidation of sorbed Fe(II) are stored, for example by formation of surface H-2 species, and are then available for the later Se(IV) reduction. The slow reaction rate indicates a diffusion controlled process. Homogeneous precipitation of an iron selenite was thermodynamically predicted and experimentally observed only in the absence of clay. Interestingly, half of Fe was oxidized in this precipitate (Mossbauer). Since DFT calculations predicted the oxidation of Fe at the water-FeSe solid interface only and not in the bulk phase, we derived an average particle size of this precipitate which does not exceed 2 nm. A comparison with the Mossbauer and XAS spectra of the clay samples demonstrates that such homogenous precipitation can be excluded as a mechanism for the observed slow Se reduction, emphasizing the role of abiotic, heterogeneous precipitation and reduction for the removal of Se from subsurface waters.

Previous investigations have demonstrated, however, that Se-IV and Se-VI are reduced by surface-associated Fe-II, thereby forming insoluble Sea and Fe selenides. Here we show that the mixed Fe-II/III (hydr)oxides green rust and magnetite, and the Fe-II sulfide mackinawite reduce selenite rapidly (< 1 day) to FeSe, while the slightly slower reduction by the Fe-II carbonate siderite produces elemental Se. In the case of mackinawite, both S-II and Fe-II surface atoms are oxidized at a ratio of one to four by producing a defective mackinawite Surface. Comparison of these spectroscopic results with thermodynamic equilibrium modeling provides evidence that the nature of reduction end product in these Fe-II systems is controlled by the concentration of HSe-: Se-0 forms only at lower HSe- concentrations related to slower HSeO3- reduction kinetics. Even under thermodynamically unstable conditions, the initially formed Se solid phases may remain stable for longer periods since their low solubility prevents the dissolution required for a phase transformation into more stable solids. The reduction by Fe2+ montmorillonite is generally much slower and restricted to a pH range, where selenite is adsorbed (pH<7), stressing the importance of a heterogeneous, surface-enhanced electron transfer reaction. Although the solids precipitated by the redox reaction are nanocrystalline, their solubility remains below 6.3 x 10(-8) M. No evidence for aqueous metal selenide colloids nor for Se sorption to colloidal phases was found. Since Fe-II phases like the ones investigated here should be ubiquitous ill the near field of nuclear waste disposals as well as in the surrounding aquifers, mobility of the fission product Se-79 may be much lower than previously assumed.

Superconductivity has been found in iron arsenides with cationic spacer layers consisting of metal ions (for example, Li+, Na+, K+, Ba2+) or PbO- or perovskite-type oxide layers, and also in Fe1.01Se (ref. 8) with neutral layers similar in structure to those found in the iron arsenides and no spacer layer. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of Li-x(NH2)(y)(NH3)(1-y)Fe2Se2 (x similar to 0.6; y similar to 0.2), with lithium ions, lithium amide and ammonia acting as the spacer layer between FeSe layers, which exhibits superconductivity at 43(1) K, higher than in any FeSe-derived compound reported so far. We have determined the crystal structure using neutron powder diffraction and used magnetometry and muon-spin rotation data to determine the superconducting properties. This new synthetic route opens up the possibility of further exploitation of related molecular intercalations in this and other systems to greatly optimize the superconducting properties in this family.", "ISSN": "1476-1122", "pub": "NATURE MATERIALS", "volume": "12", "authors": ["Burrard-Lucas, M", "Free, DG", "Sedlmaier, SJ", "Wright, JD", "Cassidy, SJ", "Hara, Y", "Corkett, AJ", "Lancaster, T", "Baker, PJ", "Blundell, SJ", "Clarke, SJ"], "issue": "1", "pages": "15-19"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0953-8984/21/23/232202", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/21/23/232202/pdf/0953-8984_21_23_232202.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 10 2009", "title": "Superconducting and normal phases of FeSe single crystals at high pressure", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/21/23/232202/", "abstract": "We report on the synthesis of superconducting single crystals of FeSe and their characterization by x-ray diffraction, magnetization and resistivity.

Above 12 GPa no traces of superconductivity are found in any sample. We have also performed a room temperature high pressure x-ray diffraction study up to 12 GPa on a powder sample, and we find that, between 8.5 and 12 GPa, the tetragonal PbO structure undergoes a structural transition to a hexagonal structure.
