OFDM/COFDM has already been implemented in digital audio broadcasting and is being considered for terrestrial digital television and HDTV broadcasting. The advantages of COFDM claimed by the advocates in Europe have also caught the attention of U.S. broadcasters and generated enthusiasm although a digital modulation technique called 8-VSB has been selected by the FCC Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS) for the final testing. There is considerable debate in the industry over the use of COFDM vs. VSB or QAM for terrestrial HDTV broadcasting.\n\nIn this paper, the history of research and development on OFDM and COFDM is reviewed. Then, the basic principles, performance and implementation of OFDM and COFDM are examined.

TPD data show that hydrogen interacts strongly with VSB-5, with desorption peaks at 109 and 149 K in a nitrogen flow, whereas the absence of similar peaks for VSB-1 suggests a weaker interaction.

The present criteria for the VSB, limiting its application to patients with normal middle ear function, have been extended to include patients with ossicular chain defects. Seven patients with severe mixed hearing loss were implanted with the transducer placed onto the round window. All had undergone previous surgery: six had multiple ossiculoplasties, and one had the VSB crimped on the incus with unsuccessful results. Round window implantation bypasses the normal conductive path and provides amplified input to the cochlea. Post-operative aided thresholds of 30 dB HL were achieved for most subjects, as compared with unaided thresholds ranging from 60-80 dB HL. Aided speech reception thresholds at 50% intelligibility were 50 dB HL, with most subjects reaching 100% intelligibility at conversational levels, while unaided thresholds averaged 80 dB HL, with only one subject reaching 100% intelligibility.

A total of 1193 patients with CT scans positive for PE from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2002, who had given authorization for retrospective research were included. Scans were independently reviewed by two observers. CT findings were compared with risk of death by using univariate analysis (chi(2) statistic) and multivariate logistic regression. Interobserver variability (kappa statistic or intraclass correlation coefficient), sensitivity, and specificity of CT findings for predicting death were calculated. A third observer reviewed discrepant cases post hoc.\n\nResults: Fifty-four percent of patients were women and 46% were men (mean age, 63 years +/- 16). For observer 1, VSB was associated with death in univariate (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; P = .04) and multivariate modeling (OR, 1.97; P = .05). Interobserver variability was only fair (kappa = 0.54) for VSB, and observer 2 found no association with death (OR, 1.52; P = .22). For both observers, VSB had low sensitivity (21% and 18%) and high specificity (88% and 87%) for predicting death. Neither RV/LV diameter ratio nor embolic burden was associated with increased risk of death. For observer 3, VSB was associated with death in univariate (OR, 2.10; P = .05) and multivariate analyses (OR, 2.18; P = .05).\n\nConclusion: CT-depicted VSB is predictive of death due to PE, but with low sensitivity and high interobserver variability. RV/LV diameter ratio and embolic burden are not associated with short-term death due to PE.

SFNs can also free up extra TV channels, resulting in more efficient use of the spectrum. The paper presents an overview of the advantages of SFNs and some basics about how to implement them. The significantly improved Signal to Interference performance and less radiated power in SFNs are derived from simple propagation models. Some potential problems that must be considered are discussed, including limitations due to receiver performance. Several simple formulas that should be helpful in quickly estimating and evaluating an SFN system are also presented. Finally, the likely implications of SFNs are covered, in particular the need for changed FCC rules and increased competition through a higher frequency reuse.

The crystal size increases in the order of MW-MW < MW-CE approximate to CE-MW < CE-CE synthesis.

Using a three-dimensional (3D) planning system (Helax, TMS(R)) the DVH for small bowel, bladder, a standard planning target volume (PTV) of postoperative irradiation of rectal cancer, the intersection of volume of PTV and small bowel (PTV boolean AND V-SB), respectively, of PTV and bladder (PTV boolean AND V-B) were defined in each axial CT slice. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was determined by the radiobiological model of Lyman and Kutcher using the tolerance data of Emami. For evaluation of late toxicity alpha/beta ratio was 2.5; for evaluation of acute toxicity, it was 10. Total dose,vas 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) (ICRU 50).\n\nResults: Using the prone position compared to the supine position, the median volume of PTV boolean AND V-B was reduced by 1815 cm(3) (62%). Median dose (related to the reference dose) to the bladder was 44.5% (22.4 Gy) in prone and 66.05% (33.3 Gy) in supine position (p < 0.001). Median V-B within the 90% (45.4 Gy), 80% (40.3 Gy), 60% (30.2 Gy), and 40% (20.2 Gy) isodose was significantly lower in the prone position when compared to the supine position. Using the radiobiological models, however, there was no difference of NTCP between prone position or supine position. In the prone position, median volume of PTV boolean AND V-SB was reduced by 32.5 cm(3) (54%). The median dose to small bo,vel,vas 30.85% (15.4 Gy) in the prone position and 47.35% (23.9Gy) in the supine position (p < 0.001). Significant differences between prone and supine position were found for median V-SB within the 90% (45.4 Gy), 80% (40.3 Gy), 60% (30.2 Gy), and 40% (20.2 Gy) isodose. According to the method of Lyman, median NTCP of small bowel was significant lower in prone than in supine position.\n\nConclusion: The prone position with a standard belly board should be the standard positioning technique for patients receiving adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy following surgery of rectal cancer. Both irradiated volume and total dose to the organs of risk can be reduced significantly. As a consequence of this, radiation induced toxicity will be minimized.

Using treatment planning data, we studied a series of such patients.\n\nMethods and Materials: Details of 41 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were reviewed. All received 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, 3-4 fields three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with daily 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid during Weeks 1 and 5. Toxicity was assessed prospectively in a weekly clinic. Using computed tomography planning software, the VSB was determined at 5 Gy dose intervals (V-5, V-10,V- etc.). Eight patients with maximal VSB had dosimetry and radiobiological modeling outcomes compared between inverse and conformal three-dimensional planning.\n\nResults: VSB correlated strongly with diarrheal severity at every dose level (p < 0.03), with strongest correlation at lowest doses. Median VSB differed significantly between patients experiencing Grade 0-1 and Grade 2-4 diarrhea (p <= 0.05). No correlation was found with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, age, body mass index, sex, tumor position, or number of fields. Analysis of 8 patients showed that inverse planning reduced median dose to small bowel by 5.1 Gy (p = 0.008) and calculated late normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) by 67% (p = 0.016). We constructed a model using mathematical analysis to predict for acute diarrhea occurring at V-5 and V-15.\n\nConclusions: A strong dose-volume relationship exists between VSB and acute diarrhea at all dose levels during preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

One chromium benzenedicarboxylate, the kinetically favorable MIL-101 (lower density phase), is the phase obtained at the early stage of the reaction, while the thermodynamically favorable MIL-53 phase (higher density phase) is obtained at the expense of MIL-101 at longer synthesis time.

The aim of this study is to evaluate aided benefit, speech recognition in quiet and noise, subjective benefits, changes in residual hearing, and medical and surgical complications in adults with conductive or mixed hearing losses implanted with the VSB using Round Window (RW) Vibroplasty(TM). Methods: Twelve German-speaking adults participated in a single-subject, repeated measures study design comparing their performance using the VSB with their own unaided preoperative performance. Hearing performance and changes in residual hearing were assessed using routine audiometric measures, sound field thresholds, and word and sentence recognition in quiet and in noise. Subjective benefits, including subjective hearing performance, device satisfaction, and quality of life were evaluated using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, the Hearing Device Satisfaction Scale, and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, respectively. Results: Aided hearing thresholds, word recognition at conversational levels, and sentence recognition in quiet and noise were significantly improved without significant changes in residual cochlear hearing and without major medical and surgical complications. One subject required repositioning surgery to improve transducer coupling with the RW membrane. Subjective benefit and device satisfaction were good, as were overall and general quality of life. Conclusion:The VSB, implanted using RW vibroplasty, is a safe and effective treatment for adults with conductive and mixed hearing losses who may have few, if any, other options.

At variance with other pure alexic patients described in the literature, VSB claimed to have become unable to mentally visualise letters and words. Indeed, his performance on a series of tests tapping visual mental imagery for orthographic material was severely impaired. However, performance on the same tests was dramatically ameliorated by allowing VSB to trace each item with his finger. Visual mental imagery for non-orthographic items was comparatively spared. The pattern of dissociation shown by VSB between impaired visual mental imagery and relatively preserved motor-based knowledge for orthographic material lends support to the view that separate codes, respectively based on visual appearance and on motor engrams, may he used to access knowledge of the visual form of letters and words.

The system consisted of a reed root zone filter of the vegetation submergent bed (VSB) type with horizontal flow of sewage, and a combination of ditches and soil filters. The facility was situated on the slope of a hill. Sewage was pretreated in an Imhoff tank and a trickling filter. Nitrogen, phosphorus and a number of heavy metals, including Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, were measured in the various components of the constructed wetland system in the period 1995-1997. Nutrients were removed mostly in the VSB filter section and in the first dam of the cascade filter. Sediments found in ditches after several years of operation consisted of plant debris. In the first ditch the depth of sediments was 5-8 cm, while in the last one it was only 2-3 cm. The heavy metal contents of suspended matter decreased along the course of treatment, starting from the VSB filter, through the first ditch to the last ditch. The main mechanism for removal of dissolved metals was sorption on particulate matter suspended in subsequent ditches. Manganese concentration was controlled by redox conditions in the various sections of the system, and was substantial in ditches rich in organic matter. Nutrients analyses in reed plant samples indicated that accumulation in biomass played an insignificant role in the distribution of analysed elements in the system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In plants, PCD is associated with immunity to biotrophic pathogens, but it can also promote disease upon infection by necrotrophic pathogens [4]. Therefore, plant cell-suicide programs must be strictly controlled. Here we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis thaliana Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1)-associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1), which operates as a coreceptor of BRI1 in brassinolide (BL)-dependent plant development, also regulates the containment of microbial infection-induced cell death. BAK1-deficient plants develop spreading necrosis upon infection. This is accompanied by production of reactive oxygen intermediates and results in enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. The exogenous application of BL rescues growth defects of bak1 mutants but fails to restore immunity to fungal infection. Moreover, BL-insensitive and -deficient mutants do not exhibit spreading necrosis or enhanced susceptibility to fungal infections. Together, these findings suggest that plant steroid-hormone signaling is dispensable for the containment of infection-induced PCD.

We determined that maize expresses >80 different R2R3 Myb genes, and evolutionary distances among maize Myb(BRH) sequences indicate that most of the amplification of the R2R3 Myb gene family occurred after the origin of land plants but prior to the separation of monocots and dicots. In addition, evidence is provided for the very recent duplication of particular classes of R2R3 Myb genes in the grasses. Together, these findings render a novel line of evidence for the amplification of the R2R3 MyB gene family in the early history of land plants and suggest that maize provides a possible model system to examine the hypothesis that the expansion of Myb genes is associated with the regulation of novel plant cellular functions.", "ISSN": "0016-6731", "pub": "GENETICS", "volume": "153", "authors": ["Rabinowicz, PD", "Braun, EL", "Wolfe, AD", "Bowen, B", "Grotewold, I"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "427-444"}, {"DOI": "10.1086/342340", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0067-0049/143/1/73/pdf/0067-0049_143_1_73.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 2002", "title": "Near-infrared and optical morphology of spiral galaxies", "abstract": "We announce the initial release of data from the Ohio State University (OSU) Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey, a BVRJHK imaging survey of a well-defined sample of 205 bright, nearby spiral galaxies.

Patients were excluded if they had weaned by the time of assessment or if they never achieved hemodynamic stability. Ventilator mode was patient triggered, flow control, volume cycled, with a tidal volume of 7 to 10 mL/kg. Esophageal pressure (Peso), airway-opening pressure, and airflow were measured in patients with TA who consented to esophageal catheter insertion. Attempts to decrease TA in each patient, included application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) stepwise to 10 cm H2O, flow triggering, and reduction of ventilator support in pressure support (PS) mode. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge, when outcomes were scored as weaned (defined as >7 days of ventilator independence), failed to wean, or died.\n\nResults: Of the 200 patients screened, 26 were excluded and 10 were found to have TA. Patients with TA were older, carried the diagnosis of COPD more frequently, and had more severe hypercapnia than their counterparts without TA. Only 3 of 19 patients (16%), all with intermittent TA, weaned from mechanical ventilation, after 70, 72, and 108 days, respectively. This is in contrast to a weaning success rate of 57%, with a median (range) time to wean of 33 (3 to 182) days in patients without TA. Observation of uncoupling of accessory respiratory muscle movement and onset of machine breaths was accurate in identifying patients with TA, which nas confirmed in all seven patients consenting to Peso monitoring. TA appeared to result from high auto-PEEP and severe pump failure. Adjusting trigger sensitivity and application of flow triggering were unsuccessful in eliminating TA; external PEEP improved but rarely led to elimination of TA that was transient in duration. Reduction of ventilator support in PS mode, with resultant increased respiratory pump output and lower tidal volumes, uniformly succeeded in eliminating TA.

Flow cytometry (FC) is a useful adjunct to fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNC) in evaluating lymphoproliferative disorders. The authors present a critical review of 307 lymph nodal and extra lymph nodal lymphoproliferative disorders that were diagnosed with FNC and FC.\n\nMETHODS. FC was performed over a 4-year period on 185 palpable and 122 impalpable lymph nodal and extra lymph nodal lymphoproliferative processes under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance. FC was performed using the following fluoresceinated antibodies: CD3, CD4/CD8, CD2/CD7/CD3, CD5/CD10/CD19, CD19/kappa/lambda, FMC7/CD23/CD19, CD38/CD56/CD19, and bcl-2. The series included 15 inadequate, 10 suspicious, and 135 benign reactive hyperplasias (BRHs); 70 primary non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), and 77 recurrent NHLs (rNHLs). FC/FNC diagnoses of suspicious, NHL, and rNHL were controlled either histologically or clinically or by the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstration of t(11;14)(q13;q32) in two cases of mantle cell lymphoma. BRHs were controlled by follow-up. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the FC/FNC diagnoses of NHL, rNHL, and BRH were calculated as well as the identification of specific subtypes among the small- and medium-sized cells.\n\nRESULTS. Statistical analysis showed 93% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV, and 91% NPV in NHL, rNHL, and BRH discrimination. The subclassification of small cell and medium-sized NHLs showed 63% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 95% PPV, and 37% NPV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS. FC applied to FNC enhanced the precision of cytologic diagnosis in lymph nodal and extra lymph nodal lymphoproliferative disorders and allowed further subclassification in more than half of the cases, thus avoiding invasive surgical biopsies in many patients.

Barlow Respiratory Hospital (BRH) functions as a center for weaning patients from prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) in the post-ICU setting of a long-term acute-care (LTAC) facility. A therapist-implemented patient-specific (TIPS) weaning protocol was developed at BRH to standardize weaning from PMV.\n\nStudy design: Prospective cohort study with historical control.\n\nMethods: A weaning protocol incorporating the procedures and pace of LTAC weaning was developed using available scientific evidence and expert consensus. After training of staff, collection and analysis of pilot data, and revisions and refinement of the protocol, the TIPS protocol was implemented hospital-wide. It was monitored for outcome, variance, and respiratory care practitioner (RCP) and physician compliance.\n\nResults: Forty-six RCPs worked with eight pulmonologists treating 271 consecutive patients admitted for weaning from PMV during an 18-month period. Nineteen patients were excluded from weaning attempts by any method after initial physician evaluation. The remaining 252 patients (9,135 total ventilator days) were compared with a group of 238 patients treated by the same physicians in the 2 years before instituting protocol weaning. Median time to wean declined significantly from 29 days in historical control subjects to 17 days for TIPS protocol patients (p < 0.001). Outcomes (scored at discharge) were comparable for the two groups (TIPS group vs control group): weaned, 54.7% vs 58.4%; ventilator-dependent, 17.9% vs 10.9%; died, 27.4% vs 30.7% (p = 0.10). Variances incurred by physicians and RCPs were 324 and 136, respectively, for the 9,135 ventilator days.\n\nConclusions: Patients weaned from PMV using a new therapist-implemented protocol at BRH, an LTAC facility specializing in weaning, had significantly shorter time to weaning than historical control subjects, with comparable outcomes. The weaning outcome data collected after the implementation of the TIPS protocol are in fact attributable to its use, as we found a high degree of compliance with the protocol.", "ISSN": "0012-3692", "pub": "CHEST", "volume": "119", "authors": ["Scheinhorn, DJ", "Chao, DC", "Stearn-Hassenpflug, M", "Wallace, WA"], "DOIlink": "http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1079373", "issue": "1", "pages": "236-242"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.1639361", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/jcp/120/7/1.1639361.pdf;jsessionid=1t48go0kee62v.x-aip-live-03?itemId=/content/aip/journal/jcp/120/7/10.1063/1.1639361&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/jcp", "pubDate": "FEB 15 2004", "title": "Third-order Douglas-Kroll relativistic coupled-cluster theory through connected single, double, triple, and quadruple substitutions: Applications to diatomic and triatomic hydrides", "abstract": "Coupled-cluster methods including through and up to the connected single, double, triple, and quadruple substitutions have been derived and implemented automatically for sequential and parallel executions by an algebraic and symbolic manipulation program TCE (TENSOR CONTRACTION ENGINE) for use in conjunction with a one-component third-order Douglas-Kroll approximation for relativistic corrections.

Two-dimensional MP2/6-31+G(d,p) potential energy surfaces were constructed for the complexes XH:NH(3), and model two-dimensional Schrodinger equations were solved for the proton stretching and dimer (heavy-atom) stretching modes. Although all complexes have equilibrium structures characterized by traditional hydrogen bonds, their infrared spectra differ significantly. In FH:NH3 both the ground (v = 0) and first excited state for the proton stretching mode (v = 1) are confined to the potential well describing the equilibrium structure. In this case the harmonic approximation is appropriate, and matrix effects are unimportant. In ClH:NH(3) the v = 1 proton stretching vibration accesses the more polar, proton-shared region of the potential surface. Here the harmonic treatment leads to a significant overestimation of the experimental proton-stretching frequency. Significant improvement results from an anharmonic treatment, which shows some coupling between proton and dimer modes. The presence of rare gas atoms preferentially stabilizes the proton-shared region of the surface, lowering the energy of the v = 1 state. Further improvement results if the MP2/aug'-cc-pVDZ potential energy surface is used. In BrH:NH3 the proton-shared region of the potential surface is accessible in both v = 0 and v = 1 vibrational states, and an anharmonic treatment is required to obtain reasonable agreement with experiment.

To compare plant-soil feedback from the native habitat in Europe and the new habitat in South Africa, plants were grown in their own soil from both Europe and South Africa, as well as in sterilised and non-sterilised soils from a number of indigenous South African foredune plant species. While the soil feedback of most plant species supports the ERH, the feedback from Sporobolus virginicus soil demonstrates that this plant species may contribute to biotic resistance against the introduced A. arenaria, through negative feedback from the soil community. Not only the local plant species diversity, but also the type of plant species present seemed to be important in determining the potential for biotic resistance. As a result, biotic resistance against invasive plant species may depend not only on plant competition, but also on the presence of plant species that are hosts of potential soil pathogens that may negatively affect the invaders.

Its eye is known to contain three visual pigments, rhodopsins, produced by an 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal chromophore together with long wavelength (LWRh), blue (BRh) and UV (UVRh1) opsins. We now find that H. erato has a second UV opsin mRNA (UVRh2)-a previously undescribed duplication of this gene among Lepidoptera. To investigate its evolutionary origin, we screened eye cDNAs from 14 butterfly species in the subfamily Heliconiinae and found both copies only among Heliconius. Phylogeny-based tests of selection indicate positive selection of UVRh2 following duplication, and some of the positively selected sites correspond to vertebrate visual pigment spectral tuning residues. Epi-microspectrophotometry reveals two UV-absorbing rhodopsins in the H. erato eye with lambda(max) = 355 nm and 398 nm. Along with the additional UV opsin, Heliconius have also evolved 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK)-based yellow wing pigments not found in close relatives. Visual models of how butterflies perceive wing color variation indicate this has resulted in an expansion of the number of distinguishable yellow colors on Heliconius wings. Functional diversification of the UV-sensitive visual pigments may help explain why the yellow wing pigments of Heliconius are so colorful in the UV range compared to the yellow pigments of close relatives lacking the UV opsin duplicate.", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "pub": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "volume": "107", "authors": ["Briscoe, AD", "Bybee, SM", "Bernard, GD", "Yuan, FR", "Sison-Mangus, MP", "Reed, RD", "Warren, AD", "Llorente-Bousquets, J", "Chiao, CC"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0910085107", "issue": "8", "pages": "3628-3633"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.449355", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/jcp/83/4/1.449355.pdf;jsessionid=3am8saxq8mxna.x-aip-live-03?itemId=/content/aip/journal/jcp/83/4/10.1063/1.449355&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/jcp", "pubDate": "1985", "title": "CLOSE-COUPLING CALCULATIONS ON THE H + BRH-]HBR + H REACTION IN 3 DIMENSIONS", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0021-9606", "pub": "JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS", "volume": "83", "authors": ["CLARY, DC"], "DOIlink": "http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/83/4/10.1063/1.449355", "issue": "4", "pages": "1685-1692"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.aca.2005.08.021", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267005014261/pdfft?md5=be1c52d20fa3bfcf0528f2aa5008e4af&pid=1-s2.0-S0003267005014261-main.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 4 2005", "title": "Effects of deuterium in octopole reaction and collision cell ICP-MS on detection of selenium in extracellular fluids", "abstract": "Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) equipped with a reaction/collision cell has been successfully used for dissociating polyatomic interferences. Hydrogen (H-2) is one of the most effective and frequently used reaction/collision gases. However, the H-2 reaction produces interference in the detection of selenium (Se) in bromine (Br)-containing samples, such as extracellular fluids. In this study, deuterium (D-2) was evaluated for possible use as a reaction gas instead of H-2. Although Se concentration in serum and urine was over-estimated in the H-2 reaction mode, it was determined accurately in the D-2 one. In speciation analyses, the background counts at m/z 77, 78 and 80 were reduced and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios were improved by either the H-2 or the D-2 reaction. The (BrH+)-Br-79-H-1 and (BrH+)-Br-81-H-1 interferences appearing at m/z 80 and 82, respectively, were decreased by changing from the H, reaction mode to the D-2 one. Thus, D-2 was effective in dissociating polyatomic interferences and removing Br interferences during Se determination and speciation, suggesting that the D-2 reaction mode is useful for selenometallomics, particularly in samples containing Br, such as serum, urine and cell culture medium.

Photon spectra (target Mo or Rh) produced by a mammographic x-ray unit at 25-32 kV and 240 mAs (= 3 times of 80 mAs) and transmitted through 0.03 mm Mo or 0.025 mm Rh filter and object (0.1 mm Al to 0.8 mm Al phantoms) have been analyzed. Since detected spectra were distorted by the response of CdZnTe detector and did not present the true photon spectra, the correction was applied by the stripping procedure. The response function of detector used in this procedure has been determined by the evaluation of interactions (K-escape, coherent scattering, and Compton scattering processes) and incomplete charge collection calculated using the Monte Carlo method. We have used K-alpha 1, K-alpha 2, K-beta 1, K-beta 2 radiations of Cd, Zn, and Te, respectively and have used the weight function for the incomplete charge collection and have considered Compton scattering. The Monte Carlo simulations were continued by changing the important factors (mean path length of hole lambda(h), dead layer of the CZT crystal and weight factor W-q) of incomplete charge collection until the best fit response function was found out. Corrected photon spectra were compared with the mammographic x-ray spectral data of Bureau of Radiological Health (BRH) measured using a Ge detector. Attenuation curves of aluminum for 25-32 kV were calculated from the corrected photon spectra and compared with the attenuation curves measured using an ionization chamber. These results obtained using the CdZnTe detector agreed with the mammographic x-ray spectral data of BRH and attenuation curves obtained by the ionization chamber.

Our results demonstrate a significant advance over previous work reported in the literature, and of particular note we are able to accurately restore the extremely long second extracellular loop (ECL2), which is also key for GPCR ligand binding. In the case of beta 2Ar, accurate ECL2 restoration required seeding a small helix into the loop in the appropriate region, based on alignment with the beta 1Ar ECL2 loop, and then running loop reconstruction simulations with and without the seeded helix present; simulations containing the helix attain significantly lower total energies than those without the helix, and have rmsds close to the native structure.

The GS-220 column coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for the separation, identification, and quantification of selenium compounds present in certified reference material (CRM) No. 18 human urine from the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan (NIES). Spiking of the authentic standard to the urine and use of a silica-based LC-SCX cation-exchange column validated the peak of selenium compounds. High concentrations of chloride and bromide in the urine eluted from the GS-220 column formed molecular ions (ArCl+)-Ar-40-Cl-37 and (BrH+)-Br-81-H-1 in the plasma, and these molecular ions created additional peaks in the chromatograms when Se-77 and Se-12 isotopes were monitored respectively. Thus, both the isotopes were selected concurrently for signal monitoring to eliminate the interfering signals. On the LC-SCX column, chloride and bromide were eluted with selenate and complicated its determination, but the peak of TmSe was baseline separated from rest of the Se compounds. Two unknown Se compounds were detected in both the columns. An additional Se compound having the same retention time as that of Semet was detected on the LC-SCX column. Peaks of selenite, selenate, TmSe and unknown selenium compounds in the urine were baseline separated on the GS-220 column, and were free from interferences. Therefore, the GS-220 column was used for the determination of selenium compounds in NIES CRM No. 18. Unknown Se compounds were the predominant selenium species followed by selenite, TmSe and selenate. The estimated value of TmSe as Se, by the standard additions method using the GS-220 column, was 3.42 +/- 0.17 mug l(-1) and was in good agreement with the LC-SCX value [3.38 +/- 0.21 (n = 5) mug l(-1)].

In addition to the regulatory role of CD98HC in L-, y+L- and Xc-amino-acid transport systems, which are principally mediated by CD98LC, we have reported transforming activity of human CD98HC. In this study, we established and analyzed BALB3T3 clones transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutated rat CD98HC proteins designated as BrH/Wild, C103S, C325S and 103/325, in which 103 and/or 325 cysteine were intact or replaced with serine. Flow cytometry with anti-rat CD98HC MAb B3 revealed that wild-type and mutated CD98HC transfectants expressed almost the same amounts of rat CD98HC proteins on the cell surface. Immunoprecipitation with B3 revealed that exogenous rat CD98HC proteins were associated with endogenous mouse CD98LC by a disulfide bond in BrH/Wild and C325S, but not in C103S and 103/325 transfectants. These transfectants showed similar doubling times and leucine and arginine transport activities, as compared with BALB3T3 and control transfectants in monolayer culture. Wild-type and C325S transfectants, however, formed much larger anchorage-independent colonies than C103S, 103/325 and control transfectants in soft agar. In addition, wild-type and C325S transfectants showed tumorigenicity in nude mice, although C103S, 103/325 and control transfectants did not. These findings indicate that over-expression of CD98HC and its disulfide-linkage with CD98LC at the cell surface result in malignant transformation of murine fibroblasts. Int. J.

The BRH sediment did not affect survival or size of adults or number of broods.

Worms were fed one of three food rations: 0.25x, 1.0x, and 6.0x. The 1.0x ration was composed of 4 mg TetraMarin/worm/week and 2 mg alfalfa/worm/week. Worms in each food ration were exposed to one of two sediments: a clean control sediment collected from Sequim Bay, Washington, USA (SC) or a contaminated sediment collected from Black Rack Harbor near Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA (BRH) that was diluted with SC such that the final concentration of contaminated sediment was 12%. Survival and growth were monitored every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Sediment treatment and food ration had strong effects on survival and growth patterns in N. arenaceodentata. Most of the mortality within any given treatment combination occurred during the first 2 weeks of the experiment. This decline in survival was greatest for worms exposed to BRH. Survival was significantly lower for worms in BRH compared to SC at the 0.25x and 1.0x ration levels. Survival was not reduced for worms in BRH compared to SC at the 6.0x ration level. Worm size during the course of the experiment was positively related to ration level. Significantly reduced size in BRH worms was observed at each monitoring period within the 0.25x and 1.0x rations, but only at weeks 6 and 8 for the 6.0x ration level. The percent difference in size between worms exposed to BRH and SC, when those worms were fed the 0.25x or 1.0x rations, ranged between 55 and 66%. The percent difference in size observed between BRH and SC worms fed the 6.0x ration was much smaller (9-17%). The results of this study demonstrate that food ration has a strong influence on observed toxicity in N. arenaceodentata.

These and earlier matrix isolation experiments show that the matrix environment markedly affects the hydrogen bonding interaction and the degree of proton transfer in the polar H3N-HBr complex.", "ISSN": "1089-5639", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A", "volume": "105", "authors": ["Andrews, L", "Wang, XF"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp010812x", "issue": "26", "pages": "6420-6429"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/ja9961101049", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 1996", "title": "Determination of selenium and arsenic in plant and animal tissues by hydride generation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry", "abstract": "A method for determining Se and As in plant and animal tissues by hydride generation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was developed, based on an evaluation of sample digestion, chemical interference and isobaric interference, Plant or animal tissue samples were digested with HNO3 + HCIO4. Se-VI was reduced to Se-IV by heating the samples in 4 mol 1(-1) HCl, but As remained as As-V. Digestion with HNO3 + HCIO4 was superior to digestion with HNO3 + H2O2, because the former was efficient, complete, and had less isobaric interference from bromine. The observed chemical interference might be caused by Cu in animal tissues forming precipitates with the hydrides during hydride generation, This chemical interference was removed by raising the sample acidity to 4 mol 1(-1) HCl, The isobaric interference of (BrH)-Br-81 with Se-82 was removed by evaporating the samples at 200 degrees C and by isobaric correction. Se could be measured by using Se-77, Se-78 or Se-82. The limit of detection was about 0.02 mu g 1(-1) for both Se and As, which is less than the background equivalent concentration of 0.05 mu g 1(-1) for Se and As. Based on a dilution factor of 50, the limit of detection for both Se and As in tissue samples was 0.001 mg kg(-1) (0.001 ppm).

To pursue maximum energy saving at sensor nodes, intuitively, a mobile collector should traverse the transmission range of each sensor in the field such that each data packet can be directly transmitted to the mobile collector without any relay. However, this approach may lead to significantly increased data gathering latency due to the low moving velocity of the mobile collector. Fortunately, it is observed that data gathering latency can be effectively shortened by performing proper local aggregation via multihop transmissions and then uploading the aggregated data to the mobile collector. In such a scheme, the number of local transmission hops should not be arbitrarily large as it may increase the energy consumption on packet relays, which would adversely affect the overall efficiency of mobile data gathering. Based on these observations, in this paper, we study the tradeoff between energy saving and data gathering latency in mobile data gathering by exploring a balance between the relay hop count of local data aggregation and the moving tour length of the mobile collector. We first propose a polling-based mobile gathering approach and formulate it into an optimization problem, named bounded relay hop mobile data gathering (BRH-MDG). Specifically, a subset of sensors will be selected as polling points that buffer locally aggregated data and upload the data to the mobile collector when it arrives. In the meanwhile, when sensors are affiliated with these polling points, it is guaranteed that any packet relay is bounded within a given number of hops. We then give two efficient algorithms for selecting polling points among sensors. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive simulations.", "ISSN": "0018-9340", "pub": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS", "volume": "61", "authors": ["Zhao, M", "Yang, YY"], "DOIlink": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5611494", "issue": "2", "pages": "265-277"}, {"DOI": "10.1023/A:1023050110077", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1023050110077.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 2003", "title": "Characterization, expression and phylogenetic study of R2R3-MYB genes in orchid", "abstract": "cDNA fragments representing 21 R2R3-MYB genes were isolated by RT-PCR from the Dendrobium orchid hybrid Woo Leng.

These studies have been carried out on all isotopomers in the presence of electric fields of varying strengths. Deuteration of HX or ammonia or trimethylamine has only minor effects on expectation values and dimer-stretching frequencies. While deuteration of the nitrogen base also has only a minor effect on proton-stretching frequencies, deuteration of the hydrogen halide has a major effect, as expected. X-D stretching frequencies are always lower than the corresponding X-H frequencies at all field strengths, although the ratio nu (D)/nu (H) for corresponding pairs of isotopomers may be less than, equal to, or greater than the harmonic ratio of 0.71. Structural and vibrational spectral changes as a function of field strength are similar for a given complex and each of its isotopomers.

We have already prospectively monitored for out-of-hospital stroke and TIAs for this same time period at 128 screening sites, including a random sample of all primary care physicians and nursing homes in the region. We have already identified all hospitalized and autopsied cases of stroke and TIA among blacks for 1/1/93-6/30/93 and report preliminary incidence rates for this 6-month period.\n\nResults-The overall incidence rate for all first-ever hospitalized or autopsiedstroke (excluding TIAs) among blacks in the Greater Cincinnati region was 288 per 100000 (95% CI, 250 to 325, age- and sex-adjusted to 1990 US population). The overall incidence rate for first-ever and recurrent stroke (excluding TIAs) was 411 per 100000 (95% CI, 366 to 456). By comparison, the overall incidence rate of first-ever stroke among whites in Rochester, Minn, during the period 1985-1989 was 179 per 100000 (95% CI, 164 to 194, age-and-sex adjusted to 1990 US population). The incidence rates among blacks in Greater Cincinnati were substantially greater than the rates among whites in Rochester, Minn, for all age categories except ages 75 and older, for which the rates were similar.\n\nConclusions-We conservatively estimate that 731100 first-ever or recurrent strokes occurred in the United States during 1996.

Patients with TIAs are at high risk of early stroke, and their risk may be stratified by clinical scale, vessel imaging, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Diagnostic recommendations include: TIA patients should undergo neuroimaging evaluation within 24 hours of symptom onset, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion sequences; noninvasive imaging of the cervical vessels should be performed and noninvasive imaging of intracranial vessels is reasonable; electrocardiography should occur as soon as possible after TIA and prolonged cardiac monitoring and echocardiography are reasonable in patients in whom the vascular etiology is not yet identified; routine blood tests are reasonable; and it is reasonable to hospitalize patients with TIA if they present within 72 hours and have an ABCD(2) score >= 3, indicating high risk of early recurrence, or the evaluation cannot be rapidly completed on an outpatient basis.

Previous studies have mostly related CRP to coronary heart disease, were often restricted to a case-control design, and failed to include pertinent risk factors to evaluate the joint and net effect of CRP on the outcome. We related plasma CRP levels to incidence of first ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the Framingham Study original cohort.\n\nMethods-There were 591 men and 871 women free of stroke/TIA during their 1980 to 1982 clinic examinations, when their mean age was 69.7 years. CRP levels were measured by using an enzyme immunoassay on previously frozen serum samples. Analyses were based on sex-specific CRP quartiles. Risk ratios (RRs) were derived, and series of trend analyses were performed.\n\nResults-During 12 to 14 years of follow-up, 196 ischemic strokes and TIAs occurred.

Surveys to major interventional centers in Europe, North and South America, and Asia were initially completed in June 1997. Subsequent information from these 24 centers in addition to 12 new centers has been obtained to update the information. The survey asked the various questions regarding the patients enrolled, procedure techniques, and results of carotid stenting, including complications and restenosis. The total number of endovascular carotid stent procedures that have been performed worldwide to date included 5,210 procedures involving 4,757 patients. There was a technical success of 98.4% with 5,129 carotid arteries treated. Complications that occurred during the carotid stent placement or within a 30-day period following placement were recorded. Overall, there were 134 transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) for a rate of 2.82%. Based on the total patient population, there were 129 minor strokes with a rate of occurrence of 2.72%. The total number of major strokes was 71 for a rate of 1.49%. There were 41 deaths within a 30-day postprocedure period resulting in a mortality rate of 0.86%. The combined minor and major strokes and procedure-related death rate was 5.07%. Restenosis rates of carotid stenting have been 1.99 % and 3.46% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The rate of neurologic events after stent placement has been 1.42% at 6-12-month follow-up. Endovascular stent treatment of carotid artery atherosclerotic disease is growing as an alternative for vascular surgery, especially for patients that are high risk for standard carotid endarterectomy. The periprocedure risks for major and minor strokes and death are generally acceptable at this early stage of development and have not changed significantly since the first survey results.

From an application of these results to US white men and women aged 35 to 64 years, it is estimated that a successful population intervention alone could reduce CHD incidence more than could medical treatment for all those with a DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher. It could prevent 84% of the number prevented by medical treatment for all those with a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher. For stroke (including TIAs), a population-wide 2-mm Hg reduction could prevent 93% of events prevented by medical treatment for those with a DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher and 69% of events for treatment for those with a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher. A combination strategy of both a population reduction in DBP and targeted medical intervention is most effective and could double or triple the impact of medical treatment alone. Adding a population-based intervention to existing levels of hypertension treatment could prevent an estimated additional 67 000 CHD events (6%) and 34 000 stroke and TIA events (13%) annually among all those aged 35 to 64 years in the United States.\n\nConclusions: A small reduction of 2 mm Hg in DBP in the mean of the population distribution, in addition to medical treatment, could have a great public health impact on the number of CHD and stroke events prevented.

Symptomatic carotid stenosis patients are at high risk of early recurrent stroke. In this group, asymptomatic microembolic signals (MES), detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), are markers of future stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) risk. They offer a surrogate marker to evaluate antiplatelet therapy, but no multicenter study has evaluated the feasibility of this approach.\n\nMethods and Results-Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli in Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis (CARESS) is a randomized, double-blind study in subjects with recently symptomatic &GE; 50% carotid stenosis.

MES were detected in 110 of 230 patients by online analysis at baseline, of whom 107 were randomized. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction in the primary end point: 43.8% of dual-therapy patients were MES positive on day 7, as compared with 72.7% of monotherapy patients ( relative risk reduction 39.8%; 95% CI, 13.8 to 58.0; P = 0.0046).

There were 43 females and 24 males with a mean age of 42 years (1970). RCVS was spontaneous in 37 of patients and secondary in the 63 others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants.

Various complications were observed, with different time courses. Cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage (cSAH) (22), intracerebral haemorrhage (6), seizures (3) and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy (9) were early complications, occurring mainly within the first week. Ischaemic events, including TIAs (16) and cerebral infarction (4), occurred significantly later than haemorrhagic events, mainly during the second week.

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to determine the reactivity of the middle cerebral artery to 8% carbon dioxide in air in 107 patients with either carotid occlusion (n = 48) or asymptomatic carotid stenosis (n = 59). Subjects were followed prospectively until stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), death or study end. Mean duration of follow-up was 635 days. No patients dropped out due to operation before an endpoint was reached, or were lost to follow-up. There were 11 ipsilateral ischaemic events during follow-up (six strokes, five TIAs). Exhausted ipsilateral middle cerebral artery reactivity (>20% increase in ipsilateral middle cerebral flow velocity in response to 8% carbon dioxide) predicted ipsilateral stroke and TIA risk in the whole group (P < 0.00001) and in the carotid occlusion (P = 0.019) and carotid stenosis (P = 0.015) groups alone. It also predicted the risk of ipsilateral stroke alone in all three groups. Cox regression was performed, controlling for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, ipsilateral CT infarct, degree of contralateral stenosis and the presence of ipsilateral stenosis versus occlusion. Exhausted reactivity remained an independent predictor of ipsilateral stroke and TIA (odds ratio 14.4, 95% confidence interval 2.63-78.74, P = 0.0021). In contrast, the pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery was a poor predictor of the risk of stroke. Reactivity to 6% carbon dioxide also predicted the risk of stroke and TIA, but slightly less effectively than reactivity to 8% carbon dioxide.

The American Heart Association assembled a group of experts in a multidisciplinary consensus conference to develop this statement.\n\nMethods A conference was held July 16-18, 1993, in Park City, Utah, that included recognized experts in neurology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery, and healthcare planning. A program of critical topics was developed, and each expert presented a talk and provided the chairman with a summary statement. From these summary statements a document was developed and edited onsite to achieve consensus before final revision.\n\nResults The first section of this document reviews the natural history, methods of patient evaluation, options for medical management, results of surgical management, data from position statements, and results to date of prospective randomized trials for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid artery disease. The second section divides 96 potential indications for carotid endarterectomy, based on surgical risk, into four categories: (1) Proven: This is the strongest indication for carotid endarterectomy; data are supported by results of prospective contemporary randomized trials. (2) Acceptable but not proven: a good indication for operation; supported by promising but not scientifically certain data. (3) Uncertain: Data are insufficient to define the risk/benefit ratio. (4) Proven inappropriate: Current data are adequate to show that the risk of surgery outweighs any benefit.\n\nConclusions Indications for carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic good-risk patients with a surgeon whose surgical morbidity and mortality rate is less than 6% are as follows. (1) Proven: one or more TIAs in the past 6 months and carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 70% or mild stroke within 6 months and a carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 70%; (2) acceptable but not proven: TIAs within the past 6 months and a stenosis 50% to 69%, progressive stroke and a stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, mild or moderate stroke in the past 6 months and a stenosis 50% to 69%, or carotid endarterectomy ipsilateral to TIAs and a stenosis greater than or equal to 70% combined with required coronary artery bypass grafting; (3) uncertain: TIAs with a stenosis <50%, mild stroke and stenosis <50%, TIAs with a stenosis <70% combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, or symptomatic, acute carotid thrombosis; (4) proven inappropriate: moderate stroke with stenosis <50%,, not on aspirin; single TIA, <50% stenosis, not on aspirin; high-risk patient with multiple TIAs, not on aspirin, stenosis <50%; high-risk patient, mild or moderate stroke, stenosis <50%, not on aspirin; global ischemic symptoms with stenosis <50%; acute dissection, asymptomatic on heparin. Indications for carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic good-risk patients performed by a surgeon whose surgical morbidity and mortality rate is less than 3% are as follows. (1) Proven: none.

Moyamoya syndrome, a narrowing of the basal intracranial vessels accompanied by the development of a cloud of collateral \"moyamoya\" vasculature, causes cerebral ischemia and stroke. This study was undertaken to determine if a standardized neurosurgical revascularization procedure, pial synangiosis, conferred long-term benefit in pediatric:1 patients.\n\nMethods. The authors reviewed the clinical and radiographic records obtained in a consecutive series of patients with moyamoya syndrome. Patients were 21 years of age or younger and underwent surgery performed by a single neurosurgeon during a 17-year period.\n\nThere were 143 patients (89 females and 54 males). Sixteen patients were Asian. Neurofibromatosis was present in 16 patients, 13 had undergone therapeutic cranial irradiation, and Down syndrome was present in 10. In 66 there was no known predisposing condition. Stroke had occurred in 67.8% of the population and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in 43.4% prior to surgery. Within the first 30 days following 271 craniotomies for pial synangiosis, there were 11 episodes of stroke (7.7% per patient; 4% per surgically treated hemisphere) and three severe TIAs.\n\nFollow-up evaluation was performed in all but one patient (mean period 5.1 years). In 126 patients followed for more than 1 year, four suffered a late-onset stroke, one suffered a severe reversible TIA without magnetic resonance imaging-documented evidence of stroke, and two experienced persistent TIAs. In 46 patients followed for more than 5 years in whom the major initial presentation was stroke alone, only two late-onset strokes have occurred.

We present the incidence and short-term prognosis of TIA within a large population with a significant proportion of minorities with out-of-hospital TIA.\n\nMethods-TIA cases were identified between July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994 from the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky population of 1.3 million inhabitants by previously published surveillance methods, including inpatient and out-of-hospital events. Incidence rates were adjusted to the 1990 population, and life-table analyses were used for prognosis.\n\nResults-The overall race, age, and gender-adjusted incidence rate for TIA within our population was 83 per 100 000, with age, race, and gender adjusted to the 1990 US population. Blacks and men had significantly higher rates of TIA than whites and women. Risk of stroke after TIA was 14.6% at 3 months, and risk of TIA/stroke/death was 25.2%. Age, race, and sex were not associated with recurrent TIA or subsequent stroke in our population, but age was associated with mortality.\n\nConclusions-Using our incidence rates for TIA in blacks and whites, we conservatively estimate that approximate to 240 000 TIAs occurred in 2002 in the United States. Our incidence rate of TIA is slightly higher than previously reported, which may be related to the inclusion of blacks and out-of-hospital events.

They arise in association with platelet activation and other unknown causes.  Elevated PMPs have been observed in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a disorder in which autoantibody interacts with platelets and the opsonized platelets are destroyed by macrophages.  However, the clinical significance of PMP has been unknown.  Using flow cytometry, we examined PMP concentrations in 62 patients with ITP and in 33 normal control subjects to assess the clinical significance of PMP in ITP.  When compared with PMP levels in control subjects, PMP levels were significantly higher (p < 0.005) in patients with ITP, but considerable variation among individual patients was observed.  Patients with platelet counts less-than-or-equal-to 60,000 were evaluated for correlation of PMP levels with manifestations of thrombocytopenias; patients without symptoms (free of petechiae or mucosal bleeding) are found to have significantly higher PMP levels (p < 0.05) than patients with symptoms, suggesting hemostatic protection by PMP.  Additionally, we identified a group of patients with ITP who experienced neurologic complications resembling transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIAs):  recurrent episodes of dizzy spells or weakness in mild cases, and coma, seizure, or progressive dementia in advanced cases.  Small cerebral infarcts were demonstrated by computed axial tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging in spite of severe thrombocytopenias.  Patients with this syndrome are often found to have higher PMP levels (p < 0.005) when compared with the group free of neurologic complications.

Our objectives were 3-fold: to document the use of warfarin and aspirin therapy in Missouri Medicare beneficiaries with chronic NVAF; to identify factors associated with warfarin and aspirin underuse; and to determine the association between prescription of warfarin and aspirin at hospital discharge and adverse outcomes in this elderly, frail population.\n\nMethods-We linked chart reviews from all Missouri hospitals to Medicare claims data from 1993 to 1996. From chart reviews, we documented Medicare beneficiaries' demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and antithrombotic therapy prescribed at the time of hospital discharge. From Medicare claims, we determined the date of outcomes-death from any cause or hospitalization for an ischemic event (a stroke, a TIA, or a myocardial infarction),\n\nResults-Only 328 (55%) of the 597 Medicare beneficiaries were prescribed antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge: 34% received warfarin and 21% received aspirin. Advanced age, female gender, and rural residency predicted underuse of antithrombotic therapy. After controlling for these factors, as well as stroke risk factors and contraindications to anticoagulation, the prescription of warfarin was associated with a 24% relative risk reduction (RRR) in adverse outcomes (P=0.003). Prescription of aspirin was associated with a nonsignificant 5% RRR in these events (P=0.56).\n\nConclusions-The underuse of antithrombotic therapy in Medicare beneficiaries who have NVAF is associated with measurable adverse outcomes. The benefit of warfarin therapy may extend to frail, elderly patients, a group that was excluded from randomized controlled trials.

Background: Ischemic tolerance or preconditioning, which protects the brain against stroke, has been demonstrated in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Because TIA may represent a clinical model of ischemic tolerance, patients with TIA before cerebral infarction (CI) may therefore have a better outcome than patients without TIA before CI. Methods: A total of 2,490 patients admitted consecutively to a primary care center for first-ever CI in the anterior circulation were divided into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of prior ipsilateral TIAs. Duration of TIA was classified into three groups (<10 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes, and >20 minutes). The severity of the neurologic picture on admission and functional disability after stroke were compared between patients with and without TIAs. Results: A total of 293 (12%) of the 2,490 patients had prior ipsilateral TIAs before CI. Risk factors did not differ between patients with or without TIAs, whereas the topography and etiology of ischemic stroke did differ (p < 0.001). Patients without prior TIAs had a more severe clinical picture on admission, with a greater reduction of consciousness (p = 0.009). Patients with previous TIAs had a more favorable outcome than those without TIAs (67% versus 58%, p = 0.004). After adjustment for confounding variables, TIAs lasting 10 to 20 minutes were still associated with a favorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 3.08; p = 0.002).

To effect solution, those subgroups of patients at greatest risk must be identified, thereby allowing efficient implementation of new clinical strategies. No such subgroup has been identified; however, patients undergoing intracardiac surgery are thought to be at high risk, but comprehensive data regarding specific risk, impact on cost, and discharge disposition are not available.\n\nMethods-We prospectively studied 273 patients enrolled from 24 diverse US medical centers, who were undergoing intracardiac and coronary artery surgery. Patient data were collected using standardized methods and included clinical, historical, specialized testing, neurological outcome and autopsy data, and measures of resource utilization. Adverse outcomes were defined a priori and determined after database closure by a blinded independent panel. Stepwise logistic regression models were developed to estimate the relative risks associated with clinical history and intraoperative and postoperative events.\n\nResults-Adverse cerebral outcomes occurred in 16% of patients (43/273), being nearly equally divided between type I outcomes (8.4%; 5 cerebral deaths, 16 nonfatal strokes, and 2 new TIAs) and type II outcomes (7.3%; 17 new intellectual deterioration persisting at hospital discharge and 3 newly diagnosed seizures). Associated resource utilization was significantly increased-prolonging median intensive care unit stay from 3 days (no adverse cerebral outcome) to 8 days (type I; P<0.001) and from 3 to 6 days (type II; P<0.001), and increasing hospitalization by 50% (type II, P=0.04) to 100% (type I, P<0.001). Furthermore, specialized care after hospital discharge was frequently necessary in those with type I outcomes, in that only 31% returned home compared with 85% of patients without cerebral complications (P<0.001). Significant risk factors for type I outcomes related primarily to embolic phenomena, including proximal aortic atherosclerosis, intracardiac thrombus, and intermittent clamping of the aorta during surgery. For type II outcomes, risk factors again included proximal aortic atherosclerosis, as well as a preoperative history of endocarditis, alcohol abuse, perioperative dysrhythmia or poorly controlled hypertension, and the development of a low-output state after cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nConclusions-These prospective multicenter findings demonstrate that patients undergoing intracardiac surgery combined with coronary revascularization are at formidable risk, in that 1 in 6 will develop cerebral complications that are frequently costly and devastating.

Our objective was to quantify the early risk of stroke after a TIA in patients with internal carotid artery disease.\n\nMethods: Using patient data from the medical arm of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, we calculated the risk of ipsilateral stroke in the territory of the symptomatic internal carotid artery within 2 and 90 days after a first-recorded hemispheric TIA. We also studied similar outcomes among patients in the trial who had a first-recorded completed hemispheric stroke.\n\nResults: For patients with a first-recorded hemispheric TIA (n = 603), the 90-day risk of ipsilateral stroke was 20.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.0%-23.2%), higher than the 2.3% risk (95% CI 1.0%-3.6%) for patients with a hemispheric stroke (n = 526). The 2-day risks were 5.5% and 0.0%, respectively. Patients with more severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery (> 70%) appeared to be at no greater risk of stroke than patients with lesser degrees of stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.7). Infarct on brain imaging (adjusted hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0) and the presence of intracranial major-artery disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7) doubled the early risk of stroke in patients with a hemispheric TIA.\n\nInterpretation: Patients who had a hemispheric TIA related to internal carotid artery disease had a high risk of stroke in the first few days after the TIA.

While contrast transthoracic echocardiography has been used to detect PFO, contrast transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has a greater sensitivity. Prior studies reported the incidence of PFO in patients presenting with a CVA or TIA.\n\nDesign: To determine the incidence of PFO in a more general population, we reviewed 1,000 consecutive TEEs performed with contrast and color Doppler for the presence of PFO and other cardioembolic risk factors, including atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), aortic plaque, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and atrial thrombi. While imaging with monoplane or biplane TEE, multiple injections of agitated saline solution were injected during cough or Valsalva maneuver to detect now through a PFO.\n\nPatients: There were 482 male and 518 female patients with mean age of 60 +/- 17 years (range 11 to 93 years). Results: Patent foramen ovale was found in 9.2% of all patients and, though seen in all age groups divided by decade, the incidence in patients aged 40 to 49 years was greater than those aged 70 to 79 years (12.96% vs 6.15%, p=0.03). Contrast TEE had a much higher detection rate than color Doppler alone. Importantly, there was no greater incidence of PFO in patients with CVA vs those without CVA, or in male vs female patients. Also, there was a very strong correlation between the presence of ASA and PFO (p<.001).\n\nConclusion: Thus, PFO detected by TEE, frequently seen with ASA, is seen in all age groups and does not in itself present a risk factor for CVA.

Ximelagatran is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics and no known food or pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\n\nMETHODS This was a 12-week, randomized, parallel-group, dose-guiding study of NVAF patients with at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary end point was the number of thromboembolic events and bleedings. Three groups received ximelagatran (n = 187) at 20, 40, or 60 mg twice daily, given in a double-blind fashion, without routine coagulation monitoring. In a fourth group, warfarin (n, = 67) was managed and monitored according to normal routines, aiming for an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.\n\nRESULTS A total of 254 patients received study drug. One ischemic stroke (nonfatal) and one transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in the ximelagatran group. Two TIAs occurred in the warfarin group. No major bleeds were observed in the ximelagatran group. One major bleed occurred in a warfarin-treated patient. The number of minor and multiple minor bleeds was low, but there was a slight increase by ximelagatran dose. The 60-mg dose resulted in the same number of bleeding events as that with warfarin. S-alanine aminotransferase was increased in eight patients (4.3%) taking ximelagatran, but normalized with continuous treatment or cessation of the drug.\n\nCONCLUSIONS Fixed oral doses of ximelagatran up to 60 mg twice daily were well tolerated, without the need for dose adjustment or coagulation monitoring.

G. Don were genetically engineered to over-express the enzymes strictosidine synthase (STR; EC 4.3.3.2) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC; EC 4.1.1.28), which catalyze key steps in the biosynthesis of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs). The cultures established after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation showed wide phenotypic diversity, reflecting the complexity of the biosynthetic pathway. Cultures transgenic for Str consistently showed tenfold higher STR activity than wild-type cultures, which favored biosynthetic activity through the pathway. Two such lines accumulated over 200 mg.L-1 of the glucoalkaloid strictosidine and/or strictosidine-derived TIAs, including ajmalicine, catharanthine, serpentine, and tabersonine, while maintaining wild-type levels of TDC activity. Alkaloid accumulation by highly productive transgenic lines showed considerable instability and was strongly influenced by culture conditions, such as the hormonal composition of the medium and the availability of precursors. High transgene-encoded TDC activity was not only unnecessary for increased productivity, but also detrimental to the normal growth of the cultures.

Thus, of addressed this issue directly by eliminating endogenous T and E production in 59 elderly men (mean age 68 years), studying them first under conditions of physiologic T and E replacement and then assessing the impact on bone turnover of withdrawing both T and E, withdrawing only T, or only E, or continuing both. Bone resorption markers increased significantly in the absence of both hormones and were unchanged in men receiving both hormones. By two-factor ANOVA, E played the major role in preventing the increase in the bone resorption markers, whereas T had no significant effect. By contrast, serum osteocalcin, a bone formation marker, decreased in the absence of both hormones, and both E and T maintained osteocalcin levels.

Axillary dissection has been a routine part of breast cancer treatment for more than 100 years. Axillary node involvement is the single most important prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer. Recently, routine node dissection has been eliminated for intraductal carcinoma because so few patients had positive nodes. With the availability of numerous histologic prognosticators and the development of new immunochemical prognostic indicators, it is time to consider eliminating routine node dissection for lesions more advanced than duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but with extremely low likelihood of axillary involvement. Methods. Axillary node positivity, disease-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival were determined for six breast cancer subgroups by T category: Tis (DCIS), T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, and T3. Results. Nodal positivity for DCIS was 0%; for T1a lesions, 3%. A large increase in nodal positivity was seen in lesions larger than 5 mm. (T1b, 17%; T1c, 32%; T2, 44%; T3, 60%). The rate of nodal positivity was statistically different as each T category was compared with the next more advanced T category. The disease-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival decreased with every increment in T value. Conclusions. Axillary node positivity increases as the size of the invasive component increases and is an excellent predictor of DSF and breast cancer-specific survival. Consideration should be given to eliminating axillary node dissection for Tla lesions because of the low yield of positive nodes. Axillary node dissection should be performed routinely for T1b lesions and larger.", "ISSN": "0008-543X", "pub": "CANCER", "volume": "73", "authors": ["SILVERSTEIN, MJ", "GIERSON, ED", "WAISMAN, JR", "SENOFSKY, GM", "COLBURN, WJ", "GAMAGAMI, P"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3<664::AID-CNCR2820730326>3.0.CO;2-S", "issue": "3", "pages": "664-667"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1976", "title": "DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID POLYMERASE FROM EXTREME THERMOPHILE THERMUS-AQUATICUS", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0021-9193", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY", "volume": "127", "authors": ["CHIEN, A", "EDGAR, DB", "TRELA, JM"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "1550-1557"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAY 1944", "title": "The pathology of fatal epidemic hepatitis", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0002-9440", "pub": "AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY", "volume": "20", "authors": ["Lucke, B"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "471-593"}, {"DOI": "10.1149/1.1801451", "pdflink": "http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/151/11/A1878.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "2004", "title": "Li-storage via heterogeneous reaction in selected binary metal fluorides and oxides", "abstract": "We report on electrochemical reactions of a variety of metal fluorides (TiF3, VF3, MnF2, FeF2, CoF2, NiF2, CuF2, CaF2, BaF2), metal oxides (TiO, TiO2, VO2, V2O3, V2O5, NbO, NbO2, Cr2O3, RuO2, MoO3), TiS2, and TiN with lithium in nonaqueous lithium cells over a wide voltage range (0.02-4.3 V) at room temperature.

The pretreatment stage distribution, as determined by endorectal ultrasound (u), included uT2N0 in 2%, uT3N0 in 47%, uT3N1 in 49%, and uT4N0 in 2% of cases; endorectal ultrasound was not performed in 13% of cases (15 patients). Approximately 6 weeks after completion of CTX/XRT, surgery was performed.\n\nResults: The pathological tumor stages were Tis-2N0 in 26%, T2N1 in 5%, T3N0 in 21%, T3N1 in 15%, T4N0 in 5%, and T4N1 in 1%; a complete response (CR) to preoperative CTX/XRT was pathologically confirmed in 32 (27%) of patients. Tumor downstaging occurred in 72 (62%) cases. Only 3% of cases had pathologic evidence of progressive disease. Pretreatment tumor size (< 5 cm vs. greater than or equal to 5 cm) was the only factor predictive of tumor downstaging (p < 0.04). A decrease of >1 T-stage level was accomplished in 45% of those downstaged. Overall, a sphincter-saving (SP) procedure was possible in 59% of patients and an abdominoperineal resection (APR) was required in 41% of cases. Factors predictive of SP included downstaging (p < 0.03), age > 40 years (p, < 0.007), pretreatment tumor distance, 3 to 6 cm from the anal verge (p < 0.00001), tumor size <6 cm (p < 0.02), mobility (p < 0.004), tumor stage <T4 (p < 0.01), and uN negative (p < < 0.008). SP was performed in 23 patients (72%) with a CR and in 48 (67%) of downstaged cases. Among the 69 tumors located < 6 cm from the anal verge, 29 (42%) were resected with a SP. The level of response was important for tumors located < 6 cm from the anal verge because a SP was performed in 9 of the 17 (53%) CRs in this group while only 20 of 52 patients (38%) had a SP when residual disease was present after CTX/XRT. For tumors located > 6 cm from the anal verge, SP was performed in 14 of the 15 (93%) patients with a CR and 32 of 33 (97%) of patients with residual disease (p < 0.00004).\n\nConclusions: Significant tumor downstaging results from preoperative chemoradiation allowing sphincter sparing surgery in over 40% of patients whose tumors were located < 6 cm from the anal verge and who otherwise would have required colostomy.

The LIM domain is a conserved cysteine-rich zinc-binding motif found in LIM-HD and LMO (rhombotin or Ttg) proteins, cytoskeletal components, LIM kinases and other proteins(1). LIM domains are protein-protein interaction motifs(1), can binding of LIM-HD proteins to DNA(6,7) and can negatively regulate LIM-HD protein function(8). How LIM domains exert these regulatory effects is not known. We have now isolated a new LIM-domain-binding factor, LdB1, on the basis of tis ability to interact with the LIM-HD protein Lhx1 (Lim1)(9). High-affinity binding by Ldb1 requires paired LIM domains and is restricted to the related subgroup of LIM domains found in LIM-HD and LMO proteins.

Existing batteries utilize lightweight active materials that use electrochemical reactions of ions such as H(+), OH(-) and Li(+)/Mg(2+) to facilitate energy storage and conversion. Ideal batteries should be inexpensive, have high energy density, and be made from environmentally friendly materials; batteries based on bulk active materials do not meet these requirements. Because of slow electrode process kinetics and low-rate ionic diffusion/migration, most conventional batterie's demonstrate huge gaps between their theoretical and practical performance.\n\nTherefore, efforts are underway to improve existing battery technologies and develop new electrode reactions for the next generation of electrochemical devices. Advances in electrochemistry, surface science, and materials chemistry are leading to the use of nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and conversion. Nanostructures offer advantages over comparable bulk materials in improving battery performance.\n\nThis Account summarizes our progress in battery development using a combination of lightweight elements and nanostructured materials. We highlight the benefits of nanostructured active materials for primary zinc-manganese dioxide (Zn-Mn), lithium - manganese dioxide (Li-Mn) and metal (Mg, Al, Zn)-air batteries, as well as rechargeable lithium ion (Li-ion) and nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. Through selected examples, we illustrate the effect of structure, shape, and size on the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. Because of their numerous active sites and facile electronic/ionic transfer and diffusion, nanostructures can improve battery efficiency.\n\nIn particular, we demonstrate the properties of nanostructured active materials including Mg, Al, Si, Zn, MiO(2), CuV(2)O(6), LiNi(0.8)Co(0.2)O(2), LiFePO(4), Fe(2)O(3), Co(3)O(4), TiS(2), and Ni(OH)(2) in battery applications. Electrochemical investigations reveal that we generally attain larger capacities and improved kinetics for electrode materials as their average particle size decreases. Novel nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanourchins, and porous nanospheres show lower activation energy, enhanced reactivity, improved high-rate charge/discharge capability, and more controlled structural flexibility than their bulk counterparts. In particular, anode materials such as Si nanospheres and Fe(2)O(3) nanotubes can deliver reversible capacity exceeding 500 mA . h/g, (Graphite used commercially has a theoretical capacity of 372 mA . h/g.) Nanocomposite cathode materials such as NiP-doped LiFePO(4) and metal hydroxide-coated Ni(OH)2 nanotubes allow us to integrate functional components, which enhance electrical conductivity and suppress volume expansion. Therefore, shifting from bulk to nanostructured electrode materials could offer a revolutionary opportunity to develop advanced green batteries with large capacity, high energy and power density, and long cycle life.", "ISSN": "0001-4842", "pub": "ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH", "volume": "42", "authors": ["Chen, J", "Cheng, FY"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar800229g", "issue": "6", "pages": "713-723"}, {"DOI": "10.1097/00000658-199403000-00007", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 1994", "title": "SURGICAL-TREATMENT OF 724 CARCINOMAS OF THE GALLBLADDER - RESULTS OF THE FRENCH-SURGICAL-ASSOCIATION SURVEY", "abstract": "Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of an aggressive approach to gallbladder carcinoma on long-term survival.\n\nSummary Background Data Recent studies have shown that an aggressive surgical treatment of bile duct carcinoma can be associated with a surprising long-term survival.

No difference was noted in the course of CIA in the injected knee joints between Ad5E1mIL-4 and the control vector, but radiographic analysis revealed impressive reduction of joint erosion and more compact bone structure in the Ad5E1mIL-4 group. Although severe inflammation persisted in treated mice, Ad5E1mIL-4 prevented bone erosion and diminished tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, indicating that local IL-4 inhibits the formation of osteoclast-like cells.

The depth of tumor invasion (T) and regional lymph node status (N) are two factors that define the stage of an esophageal carcinoma. However, the arrangement of staging groups assumes that these factors are independent variables. A retrospective review of 359 consecutive patients undergoing esophageal resection was conducted to define the relationship between T and N and to determine whether T is a significant predictor of regional lymph node metastasis (N1).\n\nMethods. Primary treatment was operation without preoperative therapy. There were 295 (82%) adenocarcinomas, 55 (15%) squamous cell carcinomas, and 9 (3%) adenosquamous carcinomas. T status was Tis in 29 (8%) patients, T1 in 65 (18%), T2 in 37 (10%), T3 in 219 (61%), and T4 in 9 (3%). N status was NO in 161 (45%) patients and N1 in 198 (55%). M status was MO in 327 (91%) patients and M1 in 32 (9%). Stage was 0 in 29 (8%) patients, I in 58 (16%), IIA in 70 (20%), IIB in 22 (6%), III in 148 (41%), and IV in 32 (9%).\n\nResults, The likelihood of N1 disease occurring with increasing T was tested using the trend test. The percentage of patients with N1 disease is 0% for Tis, 11% for T1, 43% for T2, 77% for T3, and 67% for T4 (p < 0.001). This relationship existed for both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariable analysis identified increasing T, adenocarcinoma, and lack of well-differentiated histologic features as significant predictors of N1 disease. Compared with a T1 patient, a T2 patient is 6 times more likely to have N1 disease, a T3 patient 23 times, and a T4 patient 35 times.\n\nConclusions.

We define a sample of lenses with 19.5 < R-C < 21 and a sample of background galaxies with 21.5 < R-C < 24. We present the first weak-lensing detection of the flattening of galaxy dark matter halos. We use a simple model in which the ellipticity of the halo is f times the observed ellipticity of the lens. We find a best-fit value of f = 0.77(-0.21)(+0.18) , which suggests that the dark matter halos are somewhat rounder than the light distribution. The fact that we detect a significant flattening implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution. Given the average ellipticity of the lenses, this implies a halo ellipticity of (e(halo)) = 0.33(-0.09)(+0.07) , in fair agreement with results from numerical simulations of cold dark matter. We note that this result is formally a lower limit to the flattening, since the measurements imply a larger flattening if the halos are not aligned with the light distribution. Alternative theories of gravity ( without dark matter) predict an isotropic lensing signal, which is excluded with 99.5% confidence. Hence, our results provide strong support for the existence of dark matter. We also study the average mass profile around the lenses, using a maximum likelihood analysis. We consider two models for the halo mass profile: a truncated isothermal sphere (TIS) and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. We adopt observationally motivated scaling relations between the lens luminosity and the velocity dispersion and the extent of the halo. The TIS model yields a best-fit velocity dispersion of sigma = 136 +/- 5 +/- 3 km s(-1) ( all errors are 68% confidence limits; the first error bar indicates the statistical uncertainty, whereas the second error bar indicates the systematic error) and a truncation radius s = 185(-28)(+30) h(-1) kpc for a galaxy with a fiducial luminosity of L-B = 10(10) h(-2) L-B,L-circle dot (under the assumption that the luminosity does not evolve with redshift). Alternatively, the best-fit NFW model yields a mass M-200 = (8.4 +/- 0.7 +/- 0.4) x 10(11) h(-1) M-circle dot and a scale radius r(s) = 16.2(-2.9)(+3.6) h(-1) kpc.

Concentrations of non-protein thiols (NPTs) and malondialdehyde (MDA), activity of chitinase, peroxidase (POX), and catalase significantly increased in all pea genotypes treated with Cd. Cd-sensitivity of genotypes was correlated with relative increases in MDA concentration as well as activities of chitinase and POX, suggesting similar Cd stress effects. Activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) decreased, but concentrations of glutathione (GSH) increased in the less Cd-sensitive genotypes. Differences in root and leaf contents of Cd revealed no correlation with TI, metabolic parameters, and enzyme activities in Cd-treated plants, respectively, except that shoot Cd concentration positively correlated with shoot chitinase activity. Toxic Cd levels inhibited uptake of nutrient elements such as P, K, S, Ca, Zn, Mn, and B by plants in an organ- and genotype-specific manner. Cd-sensitivity was significantly correlated with decreased root Zn concentrations.

By fusing the KRAB domain of human Kox1 to the Tet repressor derived from Tn10 of Escherichia coli, a tetracycline-controlled hybrid protein (TetR-KRAB) was generated and constitutively expressed in HeLa cells. The TetR-KRAB protein binds to tet operator (tetO) sequences in the absence but not in the presence of tetracycline. When TetR-KRAB bound to te10 sequences upstream of the immediate-early promoter-enhancer of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), the expression of a CMV-driven luciferase reporter construct (ptet07-CMV-L) was repressed in transient transfection experiments, This silencing was found to operate on different promoters and from tetO sequences placed more than 3 kb from the transcriptional start site. We constructed a stable, doubly transfected cell line (TIS-10) carrying a chromosomally integrated ptet07-CMV-L reporter construct acid expressing the TetR-KRAB protein. Upon addition of tetracycline, luciferase expression was induced more than 50-fold above the baseline level, with half-maximal induction by 2 days. Furthermore, a protein of around 110 kDa was found to coimmunoprecipitate with the TetR-KRAB fusion protein.

Cyanovirin-N, a 11-kDa protein from Cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) irreversibly inactivates HIV and also aborts cell-to-cell fusion and transmission of HIV, due to its high-affinity interaction with gp120. Various sulfated polysaccharides extracted from seaweeds (i.e., Nothogenia fastigiata, Aghardhiella tenera) inhibit the virus adsorption process. Ingenol derivatives may inhibit virus adsorption at least in part through down-regulation of CD4 molecules on the host cells. Inhibition of virus adsorption by flavanoids such as (-)epicatechin and its 3-O-gallate has been attributed to an irreversible interaction with gp120 (although these compounds are also known as reverse transcriptase inhibitors). For the triterpene glycyrrhizin (extracted from the licorice root Glycyrrhiza radix) the mode of anti-HIV action may at least in part be attributed to interference with virus-cell binding. The mannose-specific plant lectins from Galanthus, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, Epipactis helleborine, and Listera ovata, and the N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectin from Urtica dioica would primarily be targeted at the virus-cell fusion process. Various other natural products seem to qualify as HIV-cell fusion inhibitors: the siamycins [siamycin I(BMY-29304), siamycin II (RP 71955, BMY 29303), and NP-06 (FR901724)] which are tricyclic 21-amino-acid peptides isolated from Streptomyces spp that differ from one another only at position 4 or 17 (valine or isoleucine in each case); the betulinic acid derivative RPR 103611, and the peptides tachyplesin and polyphemusin which are highly abundant in hemocyte debris of the horseshoe crabs Tachypleus tridentatus and Limulus polyphemus, i.e., the 18-amino-acid peptide T22 from which T134 has been derived. Both T22 and T134 have been shown to block T-tropic X4 HIV-1 strains through a specific antagonism with the HIV coreceptor CXCR4. A number of natural products have been reported to interact with the reverse transcriptase, i.e., baicalin, avarol, avarone, psychotrine, phloroglucinol derivatives, and, in particular, calanolides (from the tropical rainforest tree, Calophyllum lanigerum) and inophyllums (from the Malaysian tree, Calophyllum inophyllum). The natural marine substance illimaquinone would be targeted at the RNase H function of the reverse transcriptase. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane, from turmeric, the roots/rhizomes of Curcuma spp), dicaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoyltartaric acids, L-chicoric acid, and a number of fungal metabolites (equisetin, phomasetin, oteromycin, and integric acid) have all been proposed as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. Yet, we have recently shown that L-chicoric acid owes its anti-HIV activity to a specific interaction with the viral envelope gp120 rather than integrase. A number of compounds would be able to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression at the transcription level: the flavonoid chrysin (through inhibition of casein kinase II, the antibacterial peptides melittin (from bee venom) and cecropin, and EM2487, a novel substance produced by Streptomyces. Alpha-Trichosanthin (from the root tubers of Trichosanthes kirilowii), MAP30 (from Momordica charantia), GAP31 (from Gelonium multiflorum), DAP30 and DAP32 (from Dianthus caryophyllus) would act as RIPs (ribosome-inactivating proteins), suppressing the translation process.\n\nAs glycosylation inhibitors, castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin would interfere with the infectivity and secondary spread of HIV-1. And so would bellenamine [(R)-3,6-diamino-N-((aminomethyl)hex anamide] (from Streptomyces nashvillensis), albeit by an unknown mechanism. Hypericin and pseudohypericin, two aromatic polycyclic diones from Hypericum triquetrifolium (St. Johnswort), could block HIV-1 infection through a variety of mechanisms (direct virucidal effect, inhibition of secondary virus spread, inhibition of virus budding, and inactivation of the preintegration complex). A number of miscellaneous compounds, including propolis, pokeweed antiviral protein, and michellamines inhibit HIV replication by mechanisms that still have to be resolved. Cyclosporins do so by preventing the interaction of cyclophilin A with the capsid gag proteins, thus blocking both a late event (assembly) and early event (nuclear localization of the preintegration complex) in the HIV replicative cycle.

A model of MCoTI-II was constructed by analogy to the crystal structure of the complex between bovine trypsin and CMTI-I, indicating that the linker connecting the two termini is flexible and does not impose significant geometrical constraints. This flexibility allows an Asp-Gly peptide bond rearrangement to occur in this region, giving rise to two isoforms of MCoTI-II. Although the importance of cyclization is not clear, it might confer increased stability and resistance to proteolysis.

The results of reporter gene analyses revealed that the insulin gene promoter is more sensitive to glycation than the control p-actin gene promoter; similar to 50 and 80% of the insulin gene promoter activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose, respectively.

Adverse tumor features for progression were equally distributed between the two groups. BCG was administered weekly for 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated every 3 to 6 months thereafter for progression to muscle invasion or metastasis.

New measures enabling better prediction of biologic behavior of large bowel cancer are highly desirable. One hundred ninety-four consecutive primary, recurrent, and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas, accessioned during 1991 at Rhode Island Hospital, were classified according to the presence and specific type of K-ras-2 point mutation.\n\nMethods. An integrated histopathologic-genetic approach was used to detect mutations starting with minute, topographically selected, tissue samples from formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens.\n\nResults. Each colorectal adenocarcinoma exhibited either no or only one of seven specific types of K-ras-2 mutation. The mutation type of each primary tumor was present consistently in its metastatic deposits. Thirty-five percent of primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were found to be mutated (42 of 119). A significantly higher mutation rate (65%) was seen in lymphogenous-hematogenous metastases as a group (35 of 54; P < 0.005). By contrast, 22% of anastomotic recurrences and transcoelomic metastasis were mutated (4 of 18). Twenty-eight percent of adenocarcinomas with invasion limited to muscularis propria (Tis, T1, T2) were mutated (16 of 57), compared to 41% for more deeply invasive tumors (T3, T4; 26 of 63). When colorectal adenocarcinomas were analyzed by specific K-ras-2 mutation type, it was found that codon 13 mutated tumors did not progress to local or distant metastasis (P < 0.01). Tumors having a codon 12 valine substitution did not metastasize beyond pericolonic-perirectal lymph nodes. In contrast, colorectal cancers with codon 12 aspartic acid substitutions accounted for most of the distant hematogenous deposits (P < 0.01). Tumors with normal K-ras-2 accounted for most intraperitoneal deposits.\n\nConclusions. Genotyping of colorectal adenocarcinoma by K-ras-2 status can identify subsets of patients likely to pursue indolent and aggressive forms of disease.

The 5-year cancer-specific survival rates for patients with pathological stage Ta (11), Tis (19), T0 (43) and T1 (91) disease were 88%, 100%, 80% and 76%, respectively. The 10-year cancer-specific survival rates were 75%, 92%, 66% and 62%, respectively. A total of 74 patients received preoperative radiation therapy (2,000 rad) but they had no better 5-year cancer-specific survival rates than did nonirradiated patients. Transurethral resection and/or preoperative radiation therapy resulted in a pathological status of TO in 43 patients but this did not confer a survival advantage. Although bladder preservation is preferable, low operative mortality and pelvic recurrence rates, as well as new methods of continent urinary diversion continue to make radical cystectomy the definitive form of therapy for patients with superficial disease recalcitrant to transurethral therapy.", "ISSN": "0022-5347", "pub": "JOURNAL OF UROLOGY", "volume": "151", "authors": ["AMLING, CL", "THRASHER, JB", "FRAZIER, HA", "DODGE, RK", "ROBERTSON, JE", "PAULSON, DF"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "31-36"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 1988", "title": "NEOADJUVANT M-VAC (METHOTREXATE, VINBLASTINE, DOXORUBICIN AND CISPLATIN) EFFECT ON THE PRIMARY BLADDER LESION", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-5347", "pub": "JOURNAL OF UROLOGY", "volume": "139", "authors": ["SCHER, HI", "YAGODA, A", "HERR, HW", "STERNBERG, CN", "BOSL, G", "MORSE, MJ", "SOGANI, PC", "WATSON, RC", "DERSHAW, DD", "REUTER, V", "GELLER, N", "HOLLANDER, PS", "VAUGHAN, ED", "WHITMORE, WF", "FAIR, WR"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "470-474"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 1943", "title": "Visceral lesions associated with chronic infectious (rheumatoid) arthritis", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0361-7017", "pub": "ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY", "volume": "35", "authors": ["Baggenstoss, AH", "Rosenberg, EF"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "4", "pages": "503-516"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0090-4295(02)02136-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429502021362/pdfft?md5=685e60ed0da8d5dcb6c7f142ef22113d&pid=1-s2.0-S0090429502021362-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 2003", "title": "Sensitivity and specificity of commonly available bladder tumor markers versus cytology: Results of a comprehensive literature review and meta-analyses", "abstract": "Objectives. To determine the clinical utility of urine-based bladder tumor markers (UBBTMs) and cytology in the treatment of patients with transitional cell carcinoma on the basis of their statistical performance.\n\nMethods. A comprehensive literature review was performed using Medline (1966 to current) and other search engines. Data regarding the statistical performance of UBBTMs were double extracted and rectified. Studies addressing comparable patient populations were combined and hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses performed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of commonly used UBBTMs, as well as urinary cytology. Patient populations were stratified by tumor stage and grade when data were presented in an extractable fashion.\n\nResults. The literature review yielded 54 publications, 338 distinct patient groups (controls, screening population, patients with cancer, strata based on grade and stage) and more than 10,000 patients. The number of groups varied from 1 to 18, and the number of patients ranged from less than 100 to more than 1500 for the various markers. All UBBTMs have better sensitivity compared with cytology, especially for low-grade/stage disease, but do not match cytology regarding specificity. In patients with grade I and 2 tumors, several UBBTMs are significantly superior statistically in terms of sensitivity compared with cytology. The sensitivity for transitional cell carcinoma in situ (Tis) is surprisingly poor for all UBBTMs.\n\nConclusions. UBBTMs can be used for follow-up of low-grade/stage tumors but should not replace cystoscopy. All UBBTMs have better sensitivity than cytology and could potentially replace routine cytology during patient follow-up. UROLOGY 61: 109-118, 2003.

Our objective here is to describe the underlying physics, mathematical details, and salient features of dust ion-acoustic as well as dust acoustic solitary and shock waves, dust voids, and dust vortex flows. It is shown that the presence of charged dust grains introduces new features to the nonlinear electrostatic waves and structures. Consideration of the dust charge fluctuation dynamics causes a novel dissipation, which is responsible for the formation of dust ion-acoustic shock waves. Furthermore, the formation of a dust void is associated with double layers and ion holes arising from trapped ion effects. Finally, a nonlinear model for dust vortex flows is presented. It is shown that the dynamics of dust vortex flows in a plasma is governed by a modified Navier-Stokes equation (MNSE), and that possible stationary solutions of the MNSE can be represented as monopolar as well as a row of identical and a row of counter-rotating vortices. The implications of our theoretical results/models to experimental observations of solitary and shock waves as well as of voids and vortices are discussed.

Normal respiratory epithelial MCC is an important host defense mechanism that is dependent on proper ciliary beating and the biological properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL). The role that tobacco smoke exposure plays as an inhibitor of MCC has yet to be elucidated. The present study investigates the consequences of cigarette smoke exposure on ciliary function and transepithelial chloride (Cl(-)) secretion, a major determinant of ASL.\n\nStudy Design: In vitro investigation.\n\nMethods: Well-characterized primary murine nasal septal epithehal (MNSE) and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cultures were exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and compared to control cultures. Effects on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and Cl(-) secretion were investigated using pharmacologic manipulation.\n\nResults: Change in forskolin-stimulated current (AISC), representing transepithelial Cl(-) secretion, was significantly decreased in CSC exposed MNSE (14.97 +/- 1.2 mu A/cm(2) vs. control, 19.1 +/- 1.56 mu A/cm(2) [P = .04]) and HSNE (2.68 0.79 mu A/cm(2) VS. control, 10.8 +/- 1.73 mu A/cm(2)) cultures (P = .001). Forskolin-stimulated CBF was also significantly reduced when acutely exposed to CSC (5.64 +/- 0.06 Hz vs. control 7.15 +/- 0.18 Hz).\n\nConclusions: The present study provides direct evidence that tobacco smoke diminishes two major components of MCC.

Comparison of the measured K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratios with the results of multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations indicates a significant increase of the 3d electron population (in relation to the pure metals) for Cr in CrSe (by 1.0 +/- 0.3) and for Mn in MnS (by 0.9 +/- 0.3). Our K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratio for Co in CoS does not show any significant change of 3d electron population. The only observed increase of the K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratio for Mn in MnSe indicates the decrease of the number of 3d electrons by 0.6 +/- 0.3. To explain evaluated changes of the 3d electron population for all the compounds, one can consider either rearrangement of electrons between 3d and 4s states of the metal or transfer of electrons from the 3d state of the metal to the ligand atom or vice versa. Although the sulphide compounds (MnS, CoS) show similar behaviour, the selenide compounds (CrSe, MnSe) show opposite behaviour which may be attributed to anomalous behaviour of rearrangement of electrons between the valence states of Cr as it happens in the case of free atom. The d-p hybridization effect which was not taken into account in our model theoretical calculation may be partly responsible for the increased K beta-to-K alpha ratio of Mn in MnSe and a comparison of the results for MnS and MnSe suggests that the nature of covalent bonding in MnSe is stronger than that of MnS.

When time-reversal symmetry is broken, the surface states are gapped, which induces a topological response of the system to electromagnetic field-the topological magnetoelectric effect. In this paper we study the behavior of topological surface states in heterostructures formed by a topological insulator and a magnetic insulator. Several magnetic insulators with compatible magnetic structure and relatively good lattice matching with topological insulators Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 are identified, and the best candidate material is found to be MnSe, an antiferromagnetic insulator. We perform first-principles calculations in Bi2Se3/MnSe superlattices and obtain the surface state band structure. The magnetic exchange coupling with MnSe induces a gap of similar to 54 meV at the surface states. In addition we tune the distance between Mn ions and the topological insulator surface to study the distance dependence of the exchange coupling.

To facilitate the analysis of the results-including those obtained in the wavelength region near the fundamental energy gap-we have modified the semiempirical single-effective-oscillator (SEO) model of n by introducing an additional term that explicitly accounts for interband transitions at the fundamental gap. Using the SEO model modified in this manner to fit the wavelength dependence of n, a set of semiempirical parameters was established for the above ternary II-VI-based alloys, where the fitting parameters for each alloy family are themselves expressed as functions of the alloy composition. The availability of these parameters makes it possible to calculate the index of refraction of any given II-VI ternary alloy for any composition and at any wavelength. Furthermore, these parameters provide valuable physical insights, such as the relationship between the covalency (or ionicity) of the material and its refractive index. In addition to its fundamental usefulness, this approach can-by appropriate extrapolation-also be used for obtaining the dispersion properties for \"hypothetical\" zinc blende compounds that do not form under equilibrium crystal growth conditions (such as MnTe, MnSe, or BeSe).

(L = ethylenediamine, or en, and 1,6-hexanediamine, or hda, x = 0-0.8) were synthesized in an autoclave at 120 degrees C. Ab initio structure solution from X-ray powder diffraction reveals the host compound CdSe center dot hda(0.5) (space group, Pbca, a = 6.8852 angstrom, b = 6.7894 angstrom, c = 27.4113 angstrom) is structurally analogous to CdSe center dot en(0.5), except for a subtle difference in alignment of aliphatic diamine ligands-the hda molecule deflects from the c axis and inclines toward the b axis. CdSe center dot L-0.5 shows well-defined UV absorption and emission peaks, which is attributed to a 2D exciton band edge transition due to size confinement effect in the c direction and the only photoemission level is the 2D exciton ground state with a long lifetime (7 mu s) and intrinsic line width (177 meV) at room temperature. When Cd2+ is partly substituted by Mn2+, a strong Mn2+-related luminescence peak at 2.12 eV (584 nm) is obtained at room temperature, which can be assigned to Mn2+ internal transition (T-4(1) -> (6)A(1)); its excitation peak overlaps with the photoemission peak of the 2D exciton ground state which indicates that the Mn2+ emission is driven by the 2D exciton ground-state transition. For x = 0.02, the photoluminescence intensity of Cd1-xMnxSe center dot hda(0.5) reaches maximum and enhances 28 times compared with that of Cd1-xMnxSe center dot en. When x < 0.05, the Mn2+ luminescence is a characteristic single-exponential decay process with a well-defined constant lifetime of 375 mu s.

The objectives of the present study were to investigate whether the polyphenolic compound resveratrol promotes transepithelial Cl(-) transport and inhibits KC/IL-8 secretion in sinonasal epithelium.\n\nStudy Design: In vitro and in vivo study.\n\nMethods: Transepithelial Cl(-) transport was investigated in primary murine nasal septal (MNSE) and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cultures. In vivo activity was also measured using the murine nasal potential difference assay. CFTR R-domain phosphorylation and cAMP levels were examined as a test of cAMP/PKA-dependent activation. In vitro LPS-induced KC/IL-8 secretion was quantified and compared to a panel of intranasal steroids.\n\nResults: Resveratrol(100 mu M) significantly increased CFTR-mediated Cl(-) transport (change in short-circuit current, DISC) in both MNSE (13.51 +/- 0.77 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.66 [control]; P < .05) and HSNE (12.28 +/- 1.08 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.32 [control]; P < .05). Cl(-) secretion across in vivo murine nasal epithelium was also enhanced (-4 +/- 1.8 vs. -0.8 +/- 1.7mV [control], P < .05). There was no increase in cellular cAMP or CFTR R-domain phosphorylation detected. Resveratrol also significantly inhibited KC/IL-8 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion (pg/mL) in MNSE (181 +/- 39[100 mu M) vs. 94 +/- 16 [200 mu M] vs. 16 +/- 22 [500 mu M] vs. 1195 +/- 355 [LPS control]; P < .001). The compound robustly abrogated KC/IL-8 secretion when compared to ciclesonide (765 +/- 139), triamcinolone (561 6 124), and budesonide (742 +/- 428), but had similar activity to fluticasone proprionate (65 +/- 47).

We report here conditions for detecting the 1 : 1 Tus-Ter complex by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI mass spectra of a mixture of Tus and nonspecific DNA showed ions predominantly from uncomplexed Tus protein, indicating that the Tus-Ter complex observed in the gas phase was the result of a specific interaction rather than nonspecific associations in the ionization source. The Tus-Ter complex was very stable using a spray solvent of 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 8.0, and initial attempts to distinguish binding affinities of Tus and mutant Tus proteins for Ter DNA were unsuccessful. Increasing the ammonium acetate concentration in the electrospray solvent (800 mM at pH 8.0) increased the dissociation constants sufficiently such that relative orders of binding affinity for Tus and various mutant Tus proteins for various DNA sequences could be determined. These were in agreement with the dissociation constants determined in solution studies. A dissociation constant of 700 x 10(-9) M for the binding of the mutant Tus protein A173T (where residue 173 is changed from alanine to threonine) to Ter DNA was estimated, compared with a value of less than or equal to2 x 10(-9) M for Tus where A173 was unchanged.

This region had an identity of 70% to the replication origin of the ColE1 plasmid at the nucleotide level. Sequence analysis revealed the typical elements: RNA 1, RNA 11 and their corresponding promoters, a sequence allowing hybridisation of RNA 11 to the DNA and favouring processing by RNaseH, a single-strand initiation determinant (ssi) that allows initiation of lagging-strand synthesis, and a terH sequence required for termination of lagging-strand synthesis. The plasmid contained three expressed open reading frames, one of which showed homology to a ColE1 plasmid-encoded protein. Furthermore, a multimer resolution site was identified by sequence analysis. Its deletion resulted in formation of plasmid multimers during growth leading to an increased plasmid loss rate.

Two clusters of five Ter sites are located on each side of the terminus region and constrain replication forks in a polar manner. The polarity is due to the formation of the Tus-Ter-lock intermediate. Recently, it has been shown that DnaB helicase which unwinds DNA at the replication fork is preferentially stopped at the non-permissive face of a Tus-Ter complex without formation of the Tus-Ter-lock and that fork pausing efficiency is sequence dependent, raising two essential questions: Does the affinity of Tus for the different Ter sites correlate with fork pausing efficiency? Is formation of the Tus-Ter-lock the key factor in fork pausing? The combined use of surface plasmon resonance and GFP-Basta showed that Tus binds strongly to TerA-E and G, moderately to TerH-J and weakly to TerF. Out of these ten Ter sites only two, TerF and H, were not able to form significant Tus-Ter-locks. Finally, Tus's resistance to dissociation from Ter sites and the strength of the Tus-Ter-locks correlate with the differences in fork pausing efficiency observed for the different Ter sites by Duggin and Bell (2009).", "ISSN": "1742-206X", "pub": "MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS", "volume": "8", "authors": ["Moreau, MJJ", "Schaeffer, PM"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/MB/c2mb25281c", "issue": "10", "pages": "2783-2791"}, {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.89.21.10139", "pdflink": "http://www.pnas.org/content/89/21/10139.full.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 1 1992", "title": "STRUCTURE OF THE COLE1 DNA MOLECULE BEFORE SEGREGATION TO DAUGHTER MOLECULES", "abstract": "The segregation of daughter DNA molecules at the end stage of replication of plasmid ColE1 was examined. When circular ColE1 DNA replicates in a cell extract at a high KCl concentration (140 mM), a unique class of molecules accumulates. When the molecule is cleaved by a restriction enzyme that cuts the ColE1 DNA at a single site, an X-shaped molecule in which two linear components are held together around the origin of DNA replication is made. For a large fraction of these molecules, the 5' end of the leading strand remains at the origin and the 3' end of the strand is about 30 nucleotides upstream of the origin. The 3' end of the lagging strand is located at the terH site (17 nucleotides upstream of the origin) and the 5' end of the strand is a few hundred nucleotides upstream of the terH site.

Grade 2 suggestion-simply that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full discussion of the grading, see the \"Grades of Recommendation\" chapter by Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: we recommend that every hospital develop a formal strategy that addresses the prevention of VTE (Grade 1A). We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A), and we recommend that mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A).\n\nFor patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups), with LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC).\n\nFor patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0 (each Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1B), a VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for a minimum of 10 days (Grade 1A); for hip arthroplasty and HFS, we recommend continuing thromboprophylaxis > 10 days and up to 35 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all major trauma and all spinal cord injury (SCI) patients receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).

The location of human MT in the present fMRI results is consistent with that of MT in earlier PET and anatomical studies.\n\nIn addition we found that area MT has a much higher contrast sensitivity than that in several other areas, including primary visual cortex (V1). Functional MRI half-amplitudes in V1 and MT occurred at approximately 15% and 1% luminance contrast, respectively. High sensitivity to contrast and motion in MT have been closely associated with magnocellular stream specialization in nonhuman primates,\n\nHuman psychophysics indicates that visual motion appears to diminish when moving color-varying stimuli are equated in luminance. Electrophysiological results from macaque MT suggest that the human percept could be due to decreases in firing of area MT cells at equiluminance. We show here that fMRI activity in human MT does in fact decrease at and near individually measured equiluminance.\n\nTests with visuotopically restricted stimuli in each hemifield produced spatial variations in fMRI activity consistent with retinotopy in human homologs of macaque areas V1, V2, V3, and VP.

It is restricted in its usage of T cell receptor (TCR) VP genes to V(beta)8, V(beta)7, and V(beta)2. Its surface phenotype is that of activated/memory cells. It carries the natural killer NK1.1 surface marker. Furthermore, though it consists entirely of CD4(+) and CD4(-)8(-) cells, its selection in the thymus depends solely upon major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression by cells of hematopoietic origin. Forced persistence of CD8, in fact, imparts negative selection. Here, we have studied the TCR repertoire of this subset and found that, whereas the beta chain V-D-J junctions are quite variable, a single invariant ct chain V(alpha)14-J281 is used by a majority of the TCRs. This surprisingly restricted usage of the V(alpha)14-J281 a! chain is dependent on MHC class I expression, but independent of the MHC haplotype. In humans, a similar unusual population including CD4(-)8(-) cells can also be found that uses a strikingly homologous, invariant alpha chain V(alpha)24-JQ. Thus, this unique V-alpha-J(alpha) combination has been conserved in both species, conferring specificity to some shared nonpolymorphic MHC class I/peptide self-ligand(s). This implies that the T cell subset that it defines has a specialized and important role, perhaps related to its unique ability to secrete a large set of lymphokines including interleukin 4, upon primary stimulation in vitro and in vivo.", "ISSN": "0022-1007", "pub": "JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE", "volume": "180", "authors": ["LANTZ, O", "BENDELAC, A"], "DOIlink": "http://jem.rupress.org/content/180/3/1097", "issue": "3", "pages": "1097-1106"}, {"DOI": "10.1126/science.2434993", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/235/4792/1056.full.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 27 1987", "title": "RNA COMPLEMENTARY TO A HERPESVIRUS ALPHA-GENE MESSENGER-RNA IS PROMINENT IN LATENTLY INFECTED NEURONS", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0036-8075", "pub": "SCIENCE", "volume": "235", "authors": ["STEVENS, JG", "WAGNER, EK", "DEVIRAO, GB", "COOK, ML", "FELDMAN, LT"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/235/4792/1056", "issue": "4792", "pages": "1056-1059"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "AUG 1997", "title": "The environmental fate of phthalate esters: A literature review", "abstract": "A comprehensive and critical review was performed on the environmental fate of eighteen commercial phthalate esters with alkyl chains ranging from 1 to 13 carbons. A synthesis of the extensive literature data on physicochemical properties, partitioning behavior, abiotic and biotic transformations and bioaccumulation processes of these chemicals is presented. This chemical class exhibits an eight order of magnitude increase in octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow) and a four order of magnitude decrease in vapor pressure (VP) as alkyl chain length increases from 1 to 13 carbons. A critical review of water solubility measurements for higher molecular weight phthalate ester; (i.e. alkyl chains greater than or equal to 6 carbons) reveals that most published values exceed true water solubilities due to experimental difficulties associated with solubility determinations for these hydrophobic organic liquids. Laboratory and field studies show that partitioning to suspended solids, soils, sediments and aerosols increase as K-ow increases and VP decreases. Photodegradation via free radical attack is expected to be the dominant degradation pathway in the atmosphere with predicted half-lives of ca. 1 day for most of the phthalate esters investigated. Numerous studies indicate that phthalate esters are degraded by a wide range of bacteria and actinomycetes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Standardized aerobic biodegradation tests with sewage sludge inocula show that phthalate esters undergo greater than or equal to 50% ultimate degradation within 28 days. Biodegradation is expected to be the dominant loss mechanism in surface waters, soils and sediments. Primary degradation half-lives in surface and marine waters range from <1 day to 2 weeks and in soils from <1 week to several months. Longer half-lives may occur in anaerobic, oligotrophic, or cold environments. Numerous experiments have shown that the bioaccumulation of phthalate esters in the aquatic and terrestrial foodchain is limited by biotransformation, which increases with increasing trophic level. Consequently, models that ignore biotransformation grossly exaggerate bioaccumulation potential of higher molecular weight phthalate esters. This review provides the logical first step in elucidating multimedia exposure to phthalate esters.

We designed a randomized trial to compare survival for patients treated with this preoperative chemoradiation regimen versus surgery alone.\n\nMaterials and Methods: One hundred patients with esophageal carcinoma were randomized to receive either surgery alone (arm I) or preoperative chemoradiation (arm II) with cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 5 and 17 through 21, fluorouracil 300 mg/ m(2)/d on days 1 through 21, and vinblastine 1 mg/ m(2)/d on days 1 through 4 and 17 through 20. Radiotherapy consisted of 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily, Monday through Friday over 21 days, to a total dose of 45 Gy. Transhiatal esophagectomy with a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed on approximately day 42.\n\nResults: At median follow-vp of 8.2 years, there is no significant difference in survival between the treatment arms. Median survival is 17.6 months in arm I and 16.9 months in arm II. Survival at 3 years was 16% in arm I and 30% in arm II (P =.15), This study was statistically powered to detect a relatively large increase in median survival from 1 year to 2.2 years, with at least 80% power.\n\nConclusion: This randomized trial of preoperative chemoradiation versus surgery alone for patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival difference.

To achieve expression of the retroviral gag-pol polyprotein, the precise coding sequences for gag-pol were introduced into a vector which utilizes totally nonretroviral signals for gene expression. Because constitutive expression of the VSV-G protein is toxic in 293 cells, we used the tet(R)/VP 16 transactivator and tet(o) minimal promoter system for inducible, tetracycline-regulatable expression of VSV-G. After stable transfection of the 293GPG packaging cell line with the MFG.SnlsLacZ retroviral vector construct, it was possible to readily isolate stable virus-producing cell lines with titers approaching 10(7) colony-forming units/ml. Transient transfection of 293GPG cells using a modified version of MFG.SnlsLacZ, in which the cytomegalovirus IE promoter was used to drive transcription of the proviral genome, led to titers of approximate to 10(6) colony-forming units/ml. The retroviral/VSV-G pseudotypes generated using 293GPG cells were significantly more resistant to human complement than commonly used amphotropic vectors and could be highly concentrated (> 1000-fold).

Twenty-two patients experienced a complete response (55%), 16 patients had a partial response (40%), and two patients, who received no treatment, were classified as nonresponders. Medians for duration of response and time to progression had not been reached after a median observation time of 29 + months, Twenty-eight of 38 assessable patients (74%) continued in remission during this median follow-vp period. The most frequent adverse events attributable to CHOP were alopecia (38 patients), neutropenia (31 patients), and fever (23 patients). The most frequent events attributed to Rituxan were fever and chills, observed primarily with the first infusion. No quantifiable immune response to the chimeric antibody was detected. In a subset of 18 patients, the bcl-2 [t(14;18)] translocation was positive in eight patients; seven of these patients herd complete remissions and converted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity by completion of therapy.\n\nConclusion: This is the first report demonstrating the safety and efficacy of Rituxan anti-CD20 chimeric antibody in combination with standard-dose systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of indolent B-cell lymphoma.

In a recent study, we reported that normal plasma contains a protease activity that cleaves vWF in a shear-dependent manner, causing a decrease in its multimer size while generating dimers of the 140-kD and the 176-kD fragments indistinguishable from those found in normal plasma. In this study, the plasma protease has been partially purified and characterized and the role of vWF conformation in its cleavage by the protease has been further investigated. Guanidine HCl caused unfolding of vWF in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in a shift in its fluorescence emission maxims to longer wavelengths. A dramatic increase in its proteolytic susceptibility was seen at 1.1 to 1.2 mol/L guanidine HCl, a concentration causing only a 3- to 4-nm shift in vWF emission maxima. Although vWF molecules refolded as guanidine HCl was removed by dialysis, the refolding was accompanied only by a partial recovery of the proteolytic resistance. The plasma protease, partially purified by approximately 900 folds by Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration, Matrex gel orange A dye affinity chromatography, and Q Sepharose anion exchange, had a molecular mass of approximately 200 kD and was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, or 1,10-phenanthroline. The inhibition by EGTA or EDTA could be reversed by Ca2+ but not by Mg2+. It was not inhibited by a panel of synthetic and natural protease inhibitors or adsorbed by gelatin-agarose, and it was present in plasmas deficient in proteins involved in coagulation and anticoagulation. The vWF fragments generated by the protease, as mapped by peptide-specific antibodies VP-1 and LJ-7745, were indistinguishable from the natural fragments but distinct from those produced by plasmin. High molecular weight endothelial vWF, after exposure to guanidine HCl or high shear stress, was cleaved by the protease to smaller forms. These results support the model that endothelial secreted vWF is converted to multimers by a novel plasma metalloproteinase. Although native vWF exists in a conformation relatively resistant to cleavage, an alteration in the conformation by shear stress can lead to an enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. This model may explain the decrease in vWF multimer sizes in various clinical conditions.

The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown.\n\nPatients and Methods Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm 3). Primary outcome was overall survival time.\n\nResults The median observation time was 6 years. The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P <. 05). Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64.3%; 95% Cl, 52.1 % to 76.5%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40.7%; 95% Cl, 28.9% to 52.5; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2.1; - 95% Cl, 1.3 to 3.5; P =. 003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12.8% v 3.5%, respectively; P =. 03). Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0.30; 95% Cl, 0.19 to 0.47; P <. 0001).\n\nConclusion Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC.

In the present study, we have examined the transport of leukotriene C-4 (LTC(4)) in membrane vesicles from MRP-transfected HeLa cells (T14), as well as drug-selected H69AR lung cancer cells which express high levels of MRP. V-max and K-m values for LTC(4) transport by membrane vesicles from T14 cells were 529 +/- 176 pmol mg(-1) min(-1) and 105 +/- 31 nM, respectively, At 50 nM LTC(4), the K-m (ATP) was 70 mu M. Transport in T14 vesicles was osmotically-sensitive and was supported by various nucleoside triphosphates but not by non- or slowly-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, LTC, transport rates in membrane vesicles derived from H69AR cells and their parental and revertant variants were consistent with their relative levels of MRP expression. A 190-kDa protein in T14 membrane vesicles was photolabeled by [H-3]LTC(4) and immunoprecipitation with MRP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confirmed that this protein was MRP, LTC, transport was inhibited by an MRP-specific mAb (QCRL-3) directed against an intracellular conformational epitope of MRP, but not by a mAb (QCRL-1) which recognizes a linear epitope, Photolabeling with [H-3]LTC(4) was also inhibitable by mAb QCRL-3 but not mAb &CRL-I, GSH did not inhibit LTC, transport, However, the ability of alkylated GSH derivatives to inhibit transport increased markedly with the length of the alkyl group, S-Decylglutathione was a potent competitive inhibitor of [H-3]LTC(4) transport (K-i(app) 116 nM), suggesting that the two compounds bind to the same, or closely related, site(s) on MRP. Chemotherapeutic agents including colchicine, doxorubicin, and daunoru bicin were poor inhibitors of [H-3]LTC, transport, Taxol, VP-16, vincristine, and vinblastine were also poor inhibitors of LTC, transport but inhibition by these compounds was enhanced by GSH. Uptake of[H-3]vincristine into T14 membrane vesicles in the absence of GSB was low and not dependent on ATP, However, in the presence of GSH, ATP-dependent vincristine transport was observed, Levels of transport increased with concentrations of GSH up to 5 mM. The identification of an MRP-specific mAb that inhibits LTC, transport and prevents photolabeling of MRP by LTC(4), provides conclusive evidence of the ability of MRP to transport cysteinyl leukotrienes, Our studies also demonstrate that MRP is capable of mediating ATP-dependent transport of vincristine and that transport is GSH-dependent.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "271", "authors": ["Loe, DW", "Almquist, KC", "Deeley, RG", "Cole, SPC"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "16", "pages": "9675-9682"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 1 2001", "title": "The circuitry mediating cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior", "abstract": "The role of limbic-striato-pallidal circuitry in cocaine-induced reinstatement was evaluated.

The estimates are based on sampling of 11,451 individual rock samples over an area of 950,000 km(2), from which 905 large composite samples were prepared and analyzed by thirteen methods. Some of the trace elements (i.e., Ag, As, Ge, Mo, Pd, Pt, Sb, Se, Sn, W) have never been subjected to systematic analysis in previous regional crustal composition studies. The middle, lower, and total crust compositions of the tectonic units are also estimated from studies of exposed crustal cross-sections and granulite xenoliths and by correlation of seismic data from eleven regional seismic refraction profiles with lithologies.\n\nThe proposed granodioritic total crust composition has the following ratios of element pairs exhibiting similar compatibility, that are identical or close to the primitive mantle values: Zr/Hf = 37, Nb/Ta = 17.5, Ba/Th = 87, K/Pb = 0.12 x 10(4), Rb/Cs = 25, Ba/Rb = 8.94, Sn/Sm = 0.31, Se/Cd = 1.64, La/As = 10.3, Ce/Sb = 271, Pb/Bi = 57, Rb/Ti = 177, Er/Ag = 52, Cu/Au = 3.2 x 10(4), Sm/Mo = 7.5, Nd/W = 40, Cl/Li = 10.8, F/Nd = 21.9, acid La/B = 1.8. The mu ((238)U/(204)Pb) value is calculated at similar to 5.\n\nThe upper crust composition is less evolved and higher in TiO(2), total FeO, Co, Cr, Ni, Sc and V, and lower in Na(2)O, K(2)O and No, Ta, Rb, Th, U, and Zr, than previous estimates based on shield samplings. Because usually the uppermost layer of the crust, where mafic volcanics tend to concentrate, has been removed from Precambrian shields, and since our study involves Phanerozoic orogenic belts, the results are suggested to be better representative of the upper crust in a general sense. Trace elements associated with mineralization (e.g., B, Cl, Se, As, Bi, Pd, W, Th, Cs, Ta, Tl, Hg, Au, and Pb) show considerable inter-unit variations by a factor of 2-5 in the upper crust. In addition, the North Qinling paleoactive margin is characterized by anomalous enrichment in Th, U, and Pb in particular and has a marked lower CL value (3.3) compared to the two cratons and the South Qinling paleopassive margin (mu = 4.5-6.2).\n\nEach tectonic unit has a relatively homogenous middle crust composition which is broadly similar to the composition of the total crust. The lower crust in East China can be divided into two layers both seismically and chemically. The upper lower crust is characterized by Vp = 6.7 km s(-1) and an intermediate composition and the lowermost crust by Vp = 7.1 km s(-1) and a mafic composition. The bulk lower crust is still intermediate in composition with 58% SiO(2) due to the dominance of the upper lower crust.\n\nP-wave velocities of both the lower and total crusts in East China are slower by 0.2-0.4 km s(-1) compared to various global estimates. Correspondingly, the total crust shows an more evolved composition and is characterized by a significant negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.80), low Sr/Nd (10.4), and high La/Nb (3.0) ratios. The obtained SiO(2) is 64% on a volatile-free basis. The near arc magma La/Nb ratio implies that intraplate crustal growth contributes <10% of the continental crust. The relative deficits in Eu, Sr, and transition metals (Cr, Ni, Co, V, and Ti) in the derived crustal compositions of East China, along with slower crustal velocity and thin crustal thickness for the Paleozoic to Mesozoic Qinling-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, strongly suggest that lower crust delamination of eclogites, as represented by those from the Dabie-Sulu belt, had played an important role in modification of the East China crust during the Phanerozoic era.

The objective of this study was to identify clinical, lesional and procedural factors that can predict restenosis after coronary stent placement.\n\nBackground. Coronary stent placement reduces the restenosis rate compared with that after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). However, restenosis remains an unresolved issue, and identification of its predictive factors may allow further insight into the underlying process.\n\nMethods. All patients with successful coronary stent placement were eligible for this study unless they had had a major adverse cardiac event during the Ist 30 days after the procedure. Of the 1,349 eligible patients (1,753 lesions), follow-vp angiography at 6 months was performed in 80.4% (1,084 patients, 1,399 lesions). Demographic, clinical, lesional and procedural data were prospectively recorded and analyzed for any predictive power for the occurrence of late restenosis after stenting. Restenosis was evaluated by using three outcomes at follow-up: binary restenosis as a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, late lumen loss as lumen diameter reduction and target lesion revascularization (TLR) as any repeat PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery involving the stented lesion.\n\nResults. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diabetes mellitus, placement of multiple stents and minimal lumen diameter (MLD) immediately after stenting were the strongest predictors of restenosis. Diabetes increased the risk of binary restenosis with an odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] of 1.86 [1.56 to 2.16] and the risk of TLR with an OR of 1.45 [1.11 to 1.80]. Multiple stents increased the risk of binary restenosis with an OR of 1.81 [1.55 to 2.06] and that of TLR with an OR of 1.94 [1.66 to 2.22]. An MLD <3 mm at the end of the procedure augmented the risk of binary restenosis with an OR of 1.81 [1.55 to 2.06] and that of TLR with an OR of 2.05 [1.77 to 2.34]. Classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated that the incidence of restenosis may be as low as 16% for a lesion without any of these risk factors and as high as 59% for a lesion with a combination of these risk factors.\n\nConclusions. Diabetes, multiple stents and smaller final MLD are strong predictors of restenosis after coronary stent placement. Achieving an optimal result with a minimal number of stents during the procedure may significantly reduce this risk even in patients with adverse clinical characteristics such as diabetes.

The transfected cells must also be overinfected with a helper virus, e.g., adenovirus (Ad), which delivers multiple helper functions necessary for rAAV production. Therefore, rAAV stocks produced using these protocols are contaminated with helper adenovirus. The generation of a novel packaging/helper plasmid, pDG, containing all AAV and Ad functions required for amplification and packaging of AAV vector plasmids, is described here. Cotransfection of cells with pDG and an AAV vector plasmid was sufficient for production of infectious rAAV, resulting in helper virus-free rAAV stocks. The rAAV titers obtained using pDG as packaging plasmid were up to Ill-fold higher than those achieved using conventional protocols for rAAV production. Replacement of the AAV-2 p5 promoter by an MMTV-LTR promoter in pDG led to reduced expression of Rep78/68; however, expression of the VP proteins was significantly increased compared with VP levels from standard packaging plasmids. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that the strong accumulation of VP proteins in pDG-transfected cells resulted in enhanced AAV capsid assembly, which is limiting for efficient rAAV production. Furthermore, using a monoclonal antibody highly specific for AAV-2 capsids (A20), an rAAV affinity purification procedure protocol was established. The application of the tools described here led to a significant improvement in recombinant AAV vector production and purification.", "ISSN": "1043-0342", "pub": "HUMAN GENE THERAPY", "volume": "9", "authors": ["Grimm, D", "Kern, A", "Rittner, K", "Kleinschmidt, JA"], "DOIlink": "http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/hum.1998.9.18-2745", "issue": "18", "pages": "2745-2760"}, {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.92.17.7690", "pdflink": "http://www.pnas.org/content/92/17/7690.full.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 15 1995", "title": "ROLE OF GLUTATHIONE IN THE EXPORT OF COMPOUNDS FROM CELLS BY THE MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN", "abstract": "Multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that can confer multidrug resistance (MDR) by lowering intracellular drug concentration.

Glutathione depletion had less effect on MDR in cells transfected with MDR1 cDNA encoding P-glycoprotein and did not increase the passive uptake of daunorubicin by cells, indicating that the decrease of MRP-mediated MDR was not due to nonspecific membrane damage. Glutathione depletion resulted in a decreased efflux of daunorubicin from MRP-transfected cells, but not from MDR1-transfected cells, suggesting that glutathione is specifically required for the export of drugs from cells by MRP.

Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time, we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years.\n\nPatients and Methods: A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody, 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n = 99), or to observation only (n = 90). Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval. Patients were stratified by a dynamic randomization according to center, sex, location of tumor, number of affected lymph nodes, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentration.\n\nResults: Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors. After 7 years of follow-vp evaluation, treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P = .01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .04; log-rank, P = .07). The intention-to-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard, P = .02; log-rank, P = .11). While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard, P = .004; log-rank, P = .004), local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard, P = .65; log-rank, P = .52). This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival.\n\nConclusion: The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients. The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow up evaluation.

ICSA studies in rodents have established that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a site supporting morphine and ethanol reinforcement. ICPC studies confirmed that injection of morphine into the VTA produces conditioned place preference (CPP). Further confirmation that activation of opioid receptors within the VTA is reinforcing comes from the findings that the endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin injected into the VTA produces CPP, and that the mu- and delta-opioid agonists, DAMGO and DPDPE, are self-infused into the VTA. Activation of the VTA dopamine (DA) system may produce reinforcing effects in general because (a) neurotensin is self-administered into the VTA, and injection of neurotensin into the VTA produces CPP and enhances DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), and (b) GABA(A) antagonists are self-administered into the anterior VTA and injections of GABA(A) antagonists into the anterior VTA enhance DA release in the NAG. The NAC also appears to have a major role in brain reward mechanisms, whereas most data from ICSA and ICPC studies do not support an involvement of the caudate-putamen in reinforcement processes. Rodents will self-infuse a variety of drugs of abuse (e.g, amphetamine, morphine, phencyclidine and cocaine) into the NAG, and this occurs primarily in the shell region. ICPC studies also indicate that injection of amphetamine into the shell portion of the NAC produces CPP. Activation of the DA system within the shell subregion of the NAC appears to play a key role in brain reward mechanisms. Rats will ICSA the DA uptake blocker, nomifensine, into the NAC shell; co-infusion with a D-2 antagonist can block this behavior. In addition, rats will self-administer a mixture of a D-1 plus a D-2 agonist into the shell, but not the core, region of the NAG. The ICSA of this mixture can be blocked with the co-infusion of either a D-1 or a D-2 antagonist. However, the interactions of other transmitter systems within the NAC may also play key roles because NMDA antagonists and the muscarinic agonist carbachol are self-infused into the NAG. The medial prefrontal (MPF) cortex supports the ICSA of cocaine and phencyclidine. The DA system also seems to play a role in this behavior since cocaine self-infusion into the MPF cortex can be blocked by co-infusing a D-2 antagonist, or with 6-OHDA lesions of the MPF cortex. Limited studies have been conducted on other CNS regions to elucidate their role in brain and drug reward mechanisms using ICSA or ICPC procedures. Among these regions, ICPC findings suggest that cocaine and amphetamine are rewarding in the rostral ventral pallidum (VP); ICSA and ICPC studies indicate that morphine is rewarding in the dorsal hippocampus, central gray and lateral hypothalamus. Finally, substance P mediated systems within the caudal VP (nucleus basalis magnocellularis) and serotonin systems of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei may also be important anatomical components involved in brain reward mechanisms. Overall, the ICSA and ICPC studies indicate that there are a number of receptors, neuronal pathways, and discrete CNS sites involved in brain reward mechanisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Only reviewed and confirmed responses were considered. The analysis of remission was based on assessable patients with documented measurable lesions. The intent-to-treat principle, log-rank test, and Cox regression model were used for the statistical analysis of time-to-event end points.\n\nResults: The overall response rate for 245 eligible patients with measurable disease was 9% with ELF, 20% with FUP, and 12% with FAMTX, with no significant differences. One hundred twelve patients were eligible for efficacy in assessable, nonmeasurable disease. No change was observed in 66% of patients treated with ELF, 56% with FUP, and 55% with FAMTX. Two patients achieved a complete tumor regression tone each for ELF and FAMTX). With a median follow-vp time of 4.5 years, the median survival times were 7.2 months with ELF, 7.2 months with FUP, and 6.7 months with FAMTX, respectively, with no significant differences. Nonhematologic and hematalagic toxicities of ELF, FUP, and FAMTX were acceptable, with neutropenia being the major toxicity for all three regimens. Seven treatment-related deaths occurred (two with FUP and five with FAMTX).\n\nConclusion: All three investigated regimens demonstrate modest clinical efficacy and should not be regarded as standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. New strategies should be considered to achieve a better clinical efficacy in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.

We analyzed plasma samples from 12 women 1-42 d after delivery of male babies and found that circulating fetal DNA was undetectable by day 1 after delivery. To obtain a higher time-resolution picture of fetal DNA clearance, we performed serial sampling of eight women, which indicated that most women (seven) had undetectable levels of circulating fetal DNA by 2 h postpartum. The mean half-life for circulating fetal DNA was 16.3 min (range 4-30 min). Plasma nucleases were found to account for only part of the clearance of plasma fetal DNA, The rapid turnover of circulating DNA suggests that plasma DNA analysis may be less susceptible to false-positive results, which result from carryover from previous pregnancies, than is the detection of fetal cells in maternal blood; also, rapid turnover may be useful for the monitoring of fete-maternal events with rapid dynamics.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this link are unknown but fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoids has been implicated, The fetus is normally protected from the higher maternal levels of glucocorticoids by fete-placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-2 (11 beta-HSD2) which inactivates glucocorticoids. We have shown previously that inhibiting 11 beta-HSD2 throughout pregnancy in rats reduces birth weight and causes hyperglycemia in the adult offspring. We now show that dexamethasone (a poor substrate for 11 beta-HSD2) administered to pregnant rats selectively in the last week of pregnancy reduces birth weight by 10% (P < 0.05), and produces adult fasting hyperglycemia (treated 5.3 +/- 0.3; control 4.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter, P = 0.04), reactive hyperglycemia (treated 8.7 +/- 0.4; control 7.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter, P = 0.03), and hyperinsulinemia (treated 6.1 +/- 0.4; control 3.8 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, P = 0.01) on oral glucose loading, In the adult offspring of rats exposed to dexamethasone in late pregnancy, hepatic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA land activity) are increased by 25% (P = 0.01) and 60% (P < 0.01), respectively, while other liver enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, glucokinase, and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1) are unaltered.

Complete necrosis was obtained in all tumor nodules in a mean number of 3.3 sessions (tumor treated by conventional electrodes) or 1.5 sessions (tumor treated by expandable electrode). The mean follow-up was 34 months; overall survival rate was 33% at 5 years. Disease-free survival at 5 years was 3%; local recurrence rate was 29% in patients treated with conventional electrodes; 14% in patients treated with the expandable electrode. Two major complications and 14 minor complications were observed. Radiofrequency thermal ablation in small HCC is very effective with a low percentage of major complications. The use of an expandable electrode substantially reduced the number of treatment sessions but did not modify the overall survival rate and the disease-free survival rate.", "ISSN": "0938-7994", "pub": "EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY", "volume": "11", "authors": ["Buscarini, L", "Buscarini, E", "Di Stasi, M", "Vallisa, D", "Quaretti, P", "Rocca, A"], "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs003300000659", "issue": "6", "pages": "914-921"}, {"DOI": "10.1203/00006450-199911000-00013", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 1999", "title": "Maternal infection, fetal inflammatory response, and brain damage in very low birth weight infants", "abstract": "Echolucent images (EL) of cerebral white matter, seen on cranial ultrasonographic scans of very low birth weight newborns, predict motor and cognitive limitations.

To delineate the cellular sites of expression of IGF and IGFBP messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) in human placenta throughout pregnancy we used in situ hybridization histochemistry with S-35-labeled IGF and IGFBP complementary RNA probes on human placentas and fetal membranes of gestational ages 6 weeks to term (40 weeks). In placental regions where trophoblasts (fetal) or decidua (maternal) coexist (e.g. basal plate), the identity was delineated by their cytokeratin or vimentin immunoreactivity, respectively. Except for IGF-II, mRNAs encoding peptides of the IGF system were expressed in a similar spatial pattern and relative abundance throughout gestation. Both IGF mRNAs showed similar tissue distribution, but the IGF-II mRNA was more abundant than IGF-I mRNA at all gestational ages. IGF-II mRNA was expressed in the chorionic mesoderm of placental villi and chorionic plate in moderate abundance, and it decreased with gestation. It was also expressed in the trophoblasts of the cytotrophoblastic shell and Langhan's layer of placental villi only in the first trimester, suggesting an autocrine role for IGF-II in early cytotrophoblastic proliferation and/or differentiation. IGF-II mRNA was expressed most abundantly in the columns of intermediate trophoblasts in the anchoring villi and chorionic and basal plates. A gradient of IGF-II mRNA abundance was observed in the trophoblasts of the cytotrophoblastic column, with greater IGF II mRNA levels in those at the invading front, suggesting a role for IGF-II in trophoblastic invasion. In the fetal membranes, IGF-II mRNA was identified in the amnion and chorion laeve. IGF-I receptor mRNA was expressed in low abundance in all cell types of the placenta. All six IGFBP mRNAs were identified in variable abundance in the decidualized stromal cells of the maternal decidua basalis and parietalis, with IGFBP-1 mRNA being expressed in the greatest abundance. The spatial pattern of expression of each IGFBP mRNA also differed among decidual cells, with IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 mRNAs being expressed in most cells, whereas IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-6 mRNAs were expressed in only some cells. IGFBP-1 mRNA was expressed initially in the epithelium of endometrial glands and in a population of decidualized stromal cells in early gestation, and subsequently in the majority of decidualized stromal cells. IGFBP-3 mRNA was expressed in both the decidua and certain intermediate trophoblasts of the basal plate and anchoring villi of placenta and in amnion and chorion laeve of fetal membranes. IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 mRNA were expressed additionally in low abundance in the chorionic mesoderm. IGFBP-6 was expressed in greater abundance in the decidua parietalis than in decidua basalis, although the general level of expression was low. The spatial pattern and relative abundance of expression of IGFBP mRNAs suggest IGFBP-1 to be the predominant IGFBP synthesized by the maternal decidual cells, interacting with the IGF-II that synthesizes fetal intermediate trophoblasts.

Placental tissue produces pregnancy by modulating cytokines and hormones essential to the regulation of the fete-maternal unit. Decidual lymphocytes express cell surface markers for activation, such as CD69 and HLA-DR, and these cells secrete many cytokines. Recent studies suggested that in pregnant women, cytokines produced by cells predominate over those produced by Th1 cells, resulting in the maintenance of pregnancy. This review article focuses on the unique cytokine network at the fete-maternal interface in humans. Recently, we demonstrated that Th2 cells were dominant within the decidua in early pregnancy in humans. The Th2-derived cytokines, IL-4 and IL-6, induce the release of hCG from trophoblasts, and the hCG stimulate progesterone production from corpus luteum in pregnancy. Progesterone stimulates the secretion of Th2 and reduces the secretion of Th1 cytokines. Thus, Th2 type cytokines appear to contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy by controlling the immune and endocrine systems and promoting the function of trophoblasts at the implantation site.

Cell trafficking was studied in informative cases using PCR-genotyping of polymorphic regions in the beta-globin cluster, the glutathione S-transferase M1 locus and the angiotensin converting enzyme gene. In addition, Y-PCR was also used in conjunction with these systems for the detection of fetal cells in maternal circulation.

These data suggest that the intrauterine environment plays a crucial role in determining later glucose homeostasis, but the mechanism is unknown. We have proposed that exposure of the fetus to excess maternal glucocorticoids may underpin the epidemiological findings. Normally placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 beta-HSD-2) protects the fetus from the normally higher maternal levels of glucocorticoids by inactivating corticosterone and cortisol to inert Il-keto products. Here we show that administration of carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of placental 11 beta-HSD 2, to pregnant rats, leads to a significant reduction in average birth weight (20 % fall). At 6 months of age, the male offspring of carbenoxolone-treated pregnancies had similar weights to controls, but showed significantly higher fasting plasma glucose (6.0 +/- 0.3 vs 4.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; p < 0.01) and exhibited significantly greater plasma glucose (10 % higher) and insulin (38 % higher) responses to an oral glucose load. These effects of carbenoxolone require intact maternal adrenal glands suggesting that inhibition of fete-placental 11 beta-HSD 2 is key.

Ewes (n = 63) of similar age, body weight, and body composition were randomly allocated to a nutrient-restricted (NR) group in which they consumed 3.2 MJ/day metabolizable energy (ME; equivalent to 50% of predicted requirements) or to a control group in which they consumed 6.7 MJ/day ME (equivalent to 110% of predicted requirements). After 77 days gestation, ewes from both dietary groups consumed close to 100% of ME requirements up to term. Newborn offspring of NR ewes were of similar body weight, but had increased crown-romp length, greater placental weight, and increased placental/body weight ratio (P < 0.01) compared with controls.

Maternal exposure is assessed relative to specific tobacco-related chemicals and the fete-placental impact of mutagenic products, in addition to nicotine replacement as a pharmacological intervention for smoking cessation. Important new information is being learned from clinical in vitro fertilization and assisted reproduction technologies regarding the effects of smoking on fertility. Present evidence supports an adverse effect of smoking on ovarian function which is prolonged and dose-dependent, whereas there appear to be more reversible effects on implantation and ongoing pregnancy. The anti-oestrogenic effect of smoking is reviewed in terms of direct effects of nicotine, cadmium and polyaromatic hydrocarbons on oestrogen synthesis and metabolism, oocytes and granulosa-luteal function. Innovative new models provide evidence that smoking may alter fertility through effects on uterine-fallopian tube functions which mediate gamete and conceptus transport. It is of interest that smoking is associated with a decreased incidence of uterine fibroids, endometriosis and uterine cancer, which may reflect inhibitory effects of smoke constituents on uterine cell proliferation and extracellular matrix interactions. The increased miscarriage rate among mothers who smoke may be related to direct adverse effects of nicotine, cadmium and polyaromatic hydrocarbons on trophoblast invasion and proliferation. In this respect, alterations in trophoblast differentiation along invasive or proliferative pathways may explain the changes in endocrine function and vascular morphology that are observed in smokers. In summary, significant advances are being made in the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms which underlie the differential effects of cigarette smoking on reproductive tissues.

Emphasis has been placed on low birth weight infants who have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke in adulthood.

The ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure was performed by using high doses of inhaled halogenated agents to facilitate uterine relaxation during cesarean section, securing the fetal airway while fete-placental circulation remained intact, and then dividing the umbilical cord. A variety of procedures were performed during the ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure including bronchoscopy, orotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, tracheostomy with retrograde orotracheal intubation,tracheoplasty, removal of internal tracheal plug, removal of external tracheal clip, central line placement, and instillation of surfactant.

Fete sampling programs for animal communities provide censuses, and usually some species in surveyed areas are not defected. Thus, counts of species detected underestimate the number of species present. We present estimators useful for drawing inferences about comparative species richness and composition between different sampling locations when not all species are detected in sampling efforts. Based on capture-recapture models using the robust design, our methods estimate relative species richness, proportion of species in one location that are also found in another, and number of species found in one location but not in another The methods use data on the presence or absence of each species at different sampling occasions (or locations) to estimate the number of species not detected nt any occasions (or locations). This approach permits estimation of the number of species in the sampled community and in subsets of the community useful for estimating the fraction of species shared by two communities. We provide an illustration of our estimation methods by comparing bird species richness and composition in two locations sampled by routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey. In this example analysis, the two locations (and associated bird communities) represented different levels of urbanization.

Systematic dependences of the derived model parameters on the families are elucidated, many of which are understood from the systematic variation of the covalency between Fe-3d and pnictogen-/chalcogen-p orbitals. First, LaFePO, LaFeAsO (1111), (BaFeAs2)-As-2 (122), LiFeAs (111), FeSe, and FeTe (11) have overall similar band structures near the Fermi level, where the total widths of 10-fold Fe-3d bands are mostly around 4.5 eV. However, the derived effective models of the 10-fold Fe-3d bands (d model) for FeSe and FeTe have substantially larger effective onsite Coulomb interactions U similar to 4.2 and 3.4 eV, respectively, after the screening by electrons on other bands and after averaging over orbitals, as compared to similar to 2.5 eV for LaFeAsO. The difference is similar in the effective models containing p orbitals of As, Se or Te (dp or dpp model), where U ranges from similar to 4 eV for the 1111 family to similar to 7 eV for the 11 family. The exchange interaction J has a similar tendency. The family dependence of models indicates a wide variation ranging from weak correlation regime (LaFePO) to substantially strong correlation regime (FeSe). The origin of the larger effective interaction in the 11 family is ascribed to smaller spread of the Wannier orbitals generating larger bare interaction, and to fewer screening channels by the other bands. This variation is primarily derived from the distance h between the pnictogen/chalcogen position and the Fe layer: The longer h for the 11 family generates more ionic character of the bonding between iron and anion atoms, while the shorter h for the 1111 family leads to more covalent-bonding character, the larger spread of the Wannier orbitals, and more efficient screening by the anion p orbitals. The screened interaction of the d model is strongly orbital dependent, which is also understood from the Wannier spread. The dp and dpp models show much weaker orbital dependence. The larger h also explains why the 10-fold 3d bands for the 11 family are more entangled with the smearing of the \"pseudogap'' structure above the Fermi level seen in the 1111 family. While the family-dependent semimetallic splitting of the bands primarily consists of d(yz)/d(zx) and d(x2-y2) orbitals, the size of the pseudogap structure is controlled by the hybridization between these orbitals and d(xy)/d(3z2-r2): A large hybridization in the 1111 family generates a large \"band-insulating''-like pseudogap ( hybridization gap), whereas a large h in the 11 family weakens them, resulting in a \"half-filled'' like bands of orbitals. This may enhance strong correlation effects in analogy with Mott physics and causes the orbital selective crossover in the three orbitals. On the other hand, the geometrical frustration t'/t, inferred from the ratio of the next-nearest transfer t' to the nearest one t of the d model is relatively larger for the 1111 family than the 11 one. The models comprehensively derived here may serve as a firm starting basis of understanding both common and diverse properties of the iron-based superconductors including magnetism and superconductivity.", "ISSN": "0031-9015", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN", "volume": "79", "authors": ["Miyake, T", "Nakamura, K", "Arita, R", "Imada, M"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.jps.jp/doi/abs/10.1143/JPSJ.79.044705", "issue": "4", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1093/molehr/3.8.655", "pdflink": "http://molehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/8/655.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "AUG 1997", "title": "Trophoblasts express Fas ligand: A proposed mechanism for immune privilege in placenta and maternal invasion", "abstract": "Cross-linking of Fas (CD95, APO-1) and Fas ligand (Fast; CD95L) induces apoptosis of Fas-bearing cells.

Bcl-2 is a membrane protein that suppresses apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. In this paper we describe abundant expression of Fast protein and mRNA transcripts within the immune privileged environment of the placenta by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription in-situ polymerase chain reaction methods.

Many xenobiotics, including a number of clinically used drugs, are known to cause unwanted effects in the embryo or fetus, including in utero death, initiation of birth defects, and production of functional abnormalities. It is well established that numerous xenobiotics are not necessarily toxic as such, but are enzymatically transformed in the body to reactive and toxic intermediates. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are known to catalyze oxidative metabolism of a vast number of compounds, including many proteratogens, procarcinogens, and promutagens. About 20 xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP forms are known to exist in humans. Most of these forms are most abundant in the liver, but examples of exclusively extrahepatic CYP forms also exist. Unlike rodents, the liver of the human fetus and even embryo possesses relatively well-developed metabolism of xenobiotics. There is experimental evidence for the presence of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 in the fetal liver after the embryonic phase (after 8 to 9 weeks of gestation). Significant xenobiotic metabolism occurs also during organogenesis (before 8 weeks of gestation). Also, some fetal extrahepatic tissues, most notably the adrenal, contain substantial levels of CYP enzymes. The full-term human placenta is devoid of many CYP activities present in liver. Placental CYP1A1 is highly inducible by maternal cigarette smoking. Other forms present in full-term placenta include CYPLCB1 and CYP19 (steroid aromatase), which also contribute to the oxidation of some xenobiotics. At earlier stages of pregnancy, the placenta may express a wider array of CYP genes, including CYP2C, CYP2D6, and CYP3A7. Due to the small size of the fetus and low abundance of CYPs in placenta, the contribution of fete-placental metabolism to overall gestational pharmacokinetics of drugs is probably minor. In contrast, several toxic outcomes have been ascribed to altered metabolic patterns in the feto-placental unit, including a putative association between reduced placental oxidative capacity and birth defects. Examples of human teratogens that are substrates for CYP enzymes include thalidomide, phenytoin, ethanol, and several hormonal agents. Recent studies have improved our understanding of the expression and regulation of individual CYP genes in the fetus and placenta, and the stage is set for applying this knowledge with mon precision to the role of xenobiotic metabolism in abnormal intrauterine development in humans.", "ISSN": "1040-8444", "pub": "CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY", "volume": "28", "authors": ["Hakkola, J", "Pelkonen, O", "Pasanen, M", "Raunio, H"], "DOIlink": "http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408449891344173", "issue": "1", "pages": "35-72"}, {"DOI": "10.1172/JCI118926", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "SEP 15 1996", "title": "Constitutive and inducible expression of SKALP/elafin provides anti-elastase defense in human epithelia", "abstract": "Skin-derived antileukoproteinase (SKALP), also known as elafin, is a serine proteinase inhibitor first discovered in keratinocytes from hyperproliferative human epidermis. In addition to the proteinase inhibiting domain which is directed against polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) derived enzymes such as elastase and proteinase 3, SKALP contains multiple transglutaminase (TGase) substrate domains which enable crosslinking to extracellular and cell envelope proteins. Here we show that SKALP is constitutively expressed in several epithelia that are continuously subjected to inflammatory stimuli, such as the oral cavity and the vagina where it co-localizes with type 1 TGase. All epithelia from sterile body cavities are negative for SKALP. In general, stratified squamous epithelia are positive, whereas pseudostratified epithelia, simple/glandular epithelia and normal epidermis are negative. SKALP was found in fetal tissues of the oral cavity from 17 wk gestation onwards where it continued to be expressed up to adult life. Remarkably, in fetal epidermis SKALP was found from week 28 onwards, but was downregulated to undetectable levels in neonatal skin within three months, suggesting a role during pregnancy in fete-maternal interactions or in the early maturation phase of the epidermis. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the presence of SKALP in secretory vesicles including the lamellar granules. In culture models for epidermal keratinocytes we found that expression of the endogenous SKALP gene provided protection against cell detachment caused by purified elastase or activated PMNs. Addition of exogenous recombinant SKALP fully protected the keratinocytes against PMN-dependent detachment whereas superoxide dismutase and catalase were only marginally effective. These findings strongly suggest that the constitutive expression of SKALP in squamous epithelia, and the inducible expression in epidermis participate in the control of epithelial integrity, by inhibiting PMN derived proteinases.", "ISSN": "0021-9738", "pub": "JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION", "volume": "98", "authors": ["Pfundt, R", "vanRuissen, F", "vanVlijmenWillems, IMJJ", "Alkemade, HAC", "Zeeuwen, PLJM", "Jap, PH", "Dijkman, H", "Fransen, J", "Croes, H", "vanErp, PEJ", "Schalkwijk, J"], "DOIlink": "http://www.jci.org/articles/view/118926", "issue": "6", "pages": "1389-1399"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 9 1996", "title": "Bovine retained placenta: Aetiology, pathogenesis and economic loss", "abstract": "The literature on the effects and causes of retained placenta in the cow is reviewed.

Of 30 treated patients, 29 patients received the intended eight cycles of BEACOPP. One patient, in clinical CR, terminated the chemotherapy at his own request after six cycles and is at this time, 48 months after the end of treatment, in complete remission. Toxicity was tolerable with WHO grade 3/4 leucopenia in 28% of chemotherapy cycles and one severe (WHO grade 3) infection. No treatment-related death occurred. Cycles could generally be given on schedule. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in all but two patients (93%). At present, only one patient has relapsed. At a median followup of 40 months, FETE-rate is 89% (lower confidence limit: 80%). One patient died due to progressive disease.\n\nConclusion: The BEACOPP regimen is feasible at moderate hematopoeitic toxicity. With a FETE-rate of 89% at a median follow-up of 40 months, the treatment results are very encouraging. A prospective randomised trial has been initiated to compare the BEACOPP regimen with the standard COPP/ABVD regimen in advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease.", "ISSN": "0923-7534", "pub": "ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY", "volume": "8", "authors": ["Diehl, V", "Sieber, M", "Ruffer, U", "Lathan, B", "Hasenclever, D", "Pfreundschuh, M", "Loeffler, M", "Lieberz, D", "Koch, P", "Adler, M", "Tesch, H"], "DOIlink": "http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/2/143", "issue": "2", "pages": "143-148"}, {"DOI": "10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19970228)63:9<1143::AID-APP6>3.0.CO;2-H", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 28 1997", "title": "Thermal and dynamic mechanical investigations on fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites", "abstract": "The thermal behavior and dynamic mechanical properties of isotactic polypropylene( PP) and reactor blend PP/ethylene-propylene copolymer(EPM), reinforced with different amounts of short glass fibers (GF) and/or polyester fibers (FETE), were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermoanalysis (DMTA) of imposed tensile load on rectangular film specimens. DSC measurements exhibited an increase of the crystallization temperature of PP in the presence of fibers, but indicated no change in its percentage of crystallinity. DMTA spectra revealed an increase in the stiffness and a decrease of the damping with increasing GF content. The positions of the primary relaxations of PP and EPM did not change, but a significant broadening of the alpha-relaxation in the crystalline phase was observed, due to the induced reinforcement and interfacial interactions. The addition of PETF to PP enhanced its damping values at low temperatures and promoted the alpha-transition. The DMTA behavior was studied in dependence on the preconditioning and the frequency excitation. Heat treatment changed the characteristics of the beta-relaxation of PP, due to enhanced molecular motion of the polymer segments. The variation of frequency affected the secondary relaxations considerably and, in the presence of GF, the glass transitions. For the different relaxations, activation energies from peak shift and loss peak areas were determined. Experimental data of loss peaks were fitted to phenomenological equations.

Previous studies have pointed out a role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) metabolism. Here, we have analyzed the incorporation of Fete clusters into yeast ferredoxin imported into isolated energized mitochondria from cells grown in the presence of glycerol, an obligatory respiratory carbon source. Similar amounts of apo-ferredoxin precursor were imported into mitochondria and processed in wild-type and yfh1-deleted (DeltaYF111) strains. However, the incorporation of Fe-S clusters into apo-ferredoxin was significantly reduced in DeltaYFH1 mitochondria. The newly assembled ferredoxin was stable, excluding the possibility that the decreased incorporation was a result of increased oxidative damage. When DeltaYFH1 cells-were grown in raffinose medium, the formation of holo-ferredoxin was low, as a consequence of the decrease in ferredoxin precursor import into mitochondria. However, the decrease in the conversion rate of apo- into holo-ferredoxin was in the same range as for glycerol-grown cells, indicating that the extent of the defect in Fe-S protein assembly is similar under different physiological conditions. These data show that frataxin is not essential for Fe-S protein assembly, but improves the efficiency of the process. The large variations observed in the activity of Fete cluster proteins under different physiological conditions result from secondary defects in the physiology of DeltaYFH1 cells.", "ISSN": "0964-6906", "pub": "HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS", "volume": "11", "authors": ["Duby, G", "Foury, F", "Ramazzotti, A", "Herrmann, J", "Lutz, T"], "DOIlink": "http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/21/2635", "issue": "21", "pages": "2635-2643"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "APR 2000", "title": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression during mouse development", "abstract": "\nFete-maternal transfer of lipophilic nutrients is an important factor in the normal development of the fetus and may be mediated by lipoproteins as carriers of these nutrients. Two proteins that map be important in this process are apolipoprotein B (apoB, the major structural protein of secreted lipoproteins) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) whose normal activity is required for the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Although no abnormalities of conception and embryonic lethality are known in humans who inherit genetic deficiencies of either of these proteins, homozygous mice bearing knockouts of either apoB or MTP show early embryonic lethality. To characterize the ontogeny of MTP expression during embryonic mouse development,we have used in situ hybridization to characterize the pattern of expression, By using microwave heating of tissue sections to optimize hybridization, we show that there is robust MTP expression in the yolk sac tissues followed by expression in the primordial liver cell nests as early as day 9 post-coitum (E9.5). Intestinal expression is detected around E12.5 and attains full adult expression patterns by E14.5. No expression in any other tissues was observed, including developing heart, kidney, placenta, and maternal decidua.

The procedure was performed under combined endoscopic and sonographic guidance. Fifteen patients were referred for evaluation and possible treatment. Two patients were excluded because of misdiagnosis. The mean gestational age at the time of the procedure was 21 weeks (range 16-25 weeks).

One, of the isolated clones was the complementary DNA for the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3), a recently identified member of the human TlMP family. When human ESC were cultured in the presence of P for 6 days, the induction of TIMP-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was observed by Northern blotting. In contrast, the marked induction of PRL mRNA expression and morphological changes were observed after 9 days of culture. P-induced TIMP-3 mRNA expression was dose dependent, and this induction was inhibited by the antiprogestin RU486. Estrogen did not induce TIMP-3 mRNA expression under similar conditions. In situ hybridization analysis of endometria from nonpregnant women revealed that the TIMP-3 mRNA expression was restricted to predecidualized stromal cells. At the fete-maternal interface, TIMP-3 expression was observed in fetal extravillous trophoblasts that had invaded the maternal decidual tissues as well as in the maternal decidual cells.

To describe the expression of JAGGED1 during human embryogenesis and to study its relationship with all the features of AGS, we performed in situ hybridization studies on human embryos and fetal tissue sections. JAGGED1 was mainly expressed in the cardiovascular system. In the liver, JAGGED1 transcripts were only detected in blood vessels. JAGGED1 was also expressed in other structures of mesenchymal origin (distal mesenchyme of limb buds; mesonephric and metanephric tubules of the kidney) and in epithelial structures including the ciliary margin of the retina and the posterior part of the lens, the ventral epithelium of the otic vesicle, the neurosensory epithelium of the ear vestibule, the epithelium of pharyngeal arches, and the developing central nervous system.

Abortions can be prevented by a second population of V gamma1.1 delta6.3 cells, which infiltrate on day 8.5 of gestation, and produce the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and Th3 cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2. In low abortion rate immunocompetent mice, most of the TGF-beta2 is derived from gamma delta T cells. However, TGF-beta2-producing cells are present in the decidua of pregnant severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice, which lack gamma delta T cells.\n\nMETHODS: The cells in day 13.5 decidua of CBA x DBA/2 matings and SCID x SCID matings were identified using flow cytometry and combined surface staining for gamma delta and/r asialoGM1, and intracellular cytokine staining for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta2,3.\n\nRESULTS: TGF-beta2 and TNF-alpha were found in asialoGM1(+) NK cells in SCID mouse decidua. In CBA x DBA/2 mated mice, two major and one minor subsets of cytokine-positive cells were identified: -gamma delta -only T cells, double positive asialoGM1(+gamma delta+) (NK-gamma delta T) cells, and a small number of asialoGM1(+) gamma delta- NK-only cells. The NK-only and NK-gamma delta T subsets showed a greater Th1/Th2,3 pattern of intracellular staining compared with the gamma delta -only subset. In the CBA x DBA/2 and SCID x SCID systems, Th1/Th2,3 ratios could not predict actual observed abortion rates but did correlate with susceptibility to abortions (if exposed to an additional stimulus such as stress). The known effect of in vivo administration of anti-asialoGM1 antibody on abortion rates within groups of mice exposed to such stresses could also be predicted.\n\nCONCLUSION: gamma delta (+) cells in decidua (e.g. V gamma1(+) cells which can recognize trophoblasts) differ based on the presence or absence of the NK marker-asialo-GM1. NK-gamma delta T cells may be quite important in the Th1 response in early pregnancy that predisposes to abortions in CBA x DBA/2 matings, whereas gamma delta T-only cells appear to be protective. In pregnant SCID mice, the TNF-alpha (+)/TGF-beta2(+) NK population is greatly expanded.

The genetic factors regulating the interactions between different cell types within fetomaternal interfaces and the relative contributions of the maternal and zygotic genomes are poorly understood. Genomic imprinting, the epigenetic process responsible for parental origin-dependent functional differences between homologous chromosomes, has been proposed to contribute to these events. Previous studies showed that mouse conceptuses with an absence of imprinted differences between the two copies of chromosome 12 (upon paternal inheritance of both copies) die late in gestation and have a variety of defects, including placentomegaly. Here we examined the role of chromosome 12 imprinting in these placentae in more detail. We show that the spatial interactions between different cell types within fetomaternal interfaces are defective and identify abnormal behaviors in both zygote-derived and maternal cells that are attributed to the genome of the zygote but not the mother. These include compromised invasion of the maternal decidualized endometrium and the central maternal artery situated within it by zygote-derived trophoblast, abnormalities in the wall of the central maternal artery, and defects within the zygote-derived cellular layer of the labyrinth, which is in direct contact with maternal blood.

Stress response and dormancy appear to represent alternative strategies of cell survival. The mechanism of persister formation is unknown, but isolated persisters show increased levels of toxin/antitoxin (TA) transcripts. We have found previously that one or more components of the SOS response induce persister formation after exposure to a DNA-damaging antibiotic. The SOS response induces several TA genes in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that a knockout of a particular SOS-TA locus, tisAB/istR, had a sharply decreased level of persisters tolerant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that causes DNA damage. Step-wise administration of ciprofloxacin induced persister formation in a tisAB-dependent manner, and cells producing TisB toxin were tolerant to multiple antibiotics. TisB is a membrane peptide that was shown to decrease proton motive force and ATP levels, consistent with its role in forming dormant cells.

Here, we describe a novel E. coli chromosome locus that is part of the SOS response to DNA damage. This locus encodes two sRNAs, IstR-1 and IstR-2, and a toxic peptide, TIsB, encoded by tisAB mRNA. Transcription of tisAB and istR-2 is SOS regulated, whereas IstR-1 is present throughout growth. IstR-1 inhibits toxicity by base-pairing to a short region in the tisAB mRNA. This antisense interaction entails RNase Ill-dependent cleavage, thereby inactivating the mRNA for translation. In the absence of the SOS response, IstR-1 is present in high excess over its target. However, SOS induction leads to depletion of the IstR-1 pool, concomitant with accumulation of tisAB mRNA. Under such conditions, TisB exerts its toxic effect, slowing down growth. We propose that the inhibitory sRNA prevents inadvertent TisB synthesis during normal growth and, possibly, also limits SOS-induced toxicity.

We show that full-length tisAB mRNA (+1) is translationally inactive and endonucleolytic processing produces an active mRNA (+42). IstR-1 binding inhibits translation of this mRNA, and subsequent RNase III cleavage generates a truncated, inactive mRNA (+106). In vitro translation, toeprinting, and structure mapping suggest that active, but not inactive, tisAB mRNAs contain an upstream ribosome loading or \"standby\" site.

Upon induction of TisB, cell growth was inhibited and plating efficiency decreased rapidly. The onset of toxicity correlated with a drastic decrease in transcription, translation and replication rates. Cellular RNA was degraded, but in vitro experiments showed that TisB did not affect translation or transcription directly. Thus, these effects are downstream consequences of membrane damage: TisB is predicted to be hydrophobic and membrane spanning, and Western analyses demonstrated that this peptide was strictly localized to the cytoplasmic membrane fraction.

Persisters can be produced stochastically in a population untreated with antibiotics. At the same time, a deterministic component of persister formation has also been documented in a population of cells with DNA damaged by fluoroquinolone treatment. Expression of the SOS response under these conditions induces formation of persisters by increasing expression of the TisB toxin. This suggests that other stress responses may also contribute to persister formation. Of particular interest is oxidative stress that pathogens encounter during infection. Activated macrophages produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which induce the SoxRS and OxyR regulons. Genes controlled by these regulons deactivate the oxidants and promote repair. We examined the ability of oxidative stress induced by paraquat (PQ) to affect persister formation. Preincubation of cells with PQ produced a dramatic increase in the number of persisters surviving challenge with fluoroquinolone antibiotics. PQ did not affect killing by kanamycin or ampicillin. Persisters in a culture treated with PQ that survived a challenge with a fluoroquinolone were also highly tolerant to other antibiotics. PQ induces SoxRS, which in turn induces expression of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug-resistant (MDR) pump. Fluoroquinolones are extruded by this MDR pump, and the effect of PQ on antibiotic tolerance was largely abolished in a mutant that was defective in the pump. It appears that PQ, acting through AcrAB-TolC, reduces the concentration of fluoroquinolones in the cells. This allows a larger fraction of cells to become persisters in the presence of a fluoroquinolone. Analysis of a lexA3 mutant indeed showed a dependence of persister induction under these conditions on SOS. These findings show that induction of a classical resistance mechanism, MDR efflux, by oxidative stress leads to an increase in multidrug-tolerant persister cells.", "ISSN": "0066-4804", "pub": "ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY", "volume": "56", "authors": ["Wu, YX", "Vulic, M", "Keren, I", "Lewis, K"], "DOIlink": "http://aac.asm.org/content/56/9/4922", "issue": "9", "pages": "4922-4926"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.2196050", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/apl/88/16/1.2196050.pdf;jsessionid=1j9ke3mj27944.x-aip-live-06?itemId=/content/aip/journal/apl/88/16/10.1063/1.2196050&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/apl", "pubDate": "APR 17 2006", "title": "Do all III-V compounds have the zinc-blende or wurtzite ground state structure?", "abstract": "The zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (W) structures are the most common crystal forms of binary III-V compounds; however, little is known about the stability of the missing TI-V and III-Bi compounds.

Circular dichroism revealed an amphiphilic alpha-helical structure when reconstituted in lipid vesicles, and oriented circular dichroism showed that the helix assumes a transmembrane alignment.

Persisters are dormant phenotypic variants of regular cells rather than mutants. Bactericidal antibiotics kill by corrupting their targets into producing toxic products; tolerance to antibiotics follows when targets are inactive. Transcriptome analysis of isolated persisters points to toxin/antitoxin modules as a principle component of persister formation. Mechanisms of persister formation are redundant, making it difficult to eradicate these cells. In Escherichia coli, toxins RelE and MazF cause dormancy by degrading mRNA; HipA inhibits translation by phosphorylating Ef-Tu; and TisB forms an anion channel in the membrane, leading to a decrease in pmf and ATP levels. Prolonged treatment of chronic infections with antibiotics selects for hip mutants that produce more persister cells. Eradication of tolerant persisters is a serious challenge. Some of the existing antibiotics are capable of killing persisters, pointing to ways of developing therapeutics to treat chronic infections. Mitomycin is a prodrug which is converted into a reactive compound forming adducts with DNA upon entering the cell. Prolonged treatment with aminoglycosides that cause mistranslation leading to misfolded peptides can sterilize a stationary culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen responsible for chronic, highly tolerant infections of cystic fibrosis patients. Finally, one of the best bactericidal agents is rifampin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase, and we suggest that it \"kills\" by preventing persister resuscitation.", "ISSN": "0076-6879", "pub": "NATURAL PRODUCT BIOSYNTHESIS BY MICROORGANISMS AND PLANTS, PT C", "volume": "517", "authors": ["Keren, I", "Mulcahy, LR", "Lewis, K"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012404634400019X", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "387-406"}, {"DOI": "10.1002/ejic.200500856", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1099-0682c/homepage/2005_media.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 6 2006", "title": "Synthesis and characterisation of alkali metal and thallium polyfluoroantimonates, ASb(n)F(5n+1) (n=2, 3)", "abstract": "the other hand, is monoclinic at 250 K [P2(1)/n, with a 774.10(14), b = 1425.41(17)m, c = 951.30(15) pm, beta 113.226(6)degrees, V = 0.9646(3) nm(3) and Z = 4].

The angular dependence of the magnetization has been studied. Ferromagnetic ordering develops within the ab plane at T-C = 130 K for U3ScSb5 and 160 K for U3TiSb5, but there are essentially no magnetic interactions parallel to the c axis, confirming the high anisotropy expected from the crystal structure. In both cases, the easy axis for magnetization is the [120] direction. A sharp decrease below the ordering temperature is observed in the electrical resistivity parallel to the c axis; in contrast, the temperature dependence is much weaker within the ab plane. For U3TiSb5, a second transition occurs at 25 K, possibly arising from a spin reorientation process. The thermoelectric power measured along the c axis for both compounds is positive and small at high temperatures, following approximately a linear dependence with temperature indicative of metallic behavior in this region. The thermopower exhibits a kink at the ferromagnetic transition temperature in the case of U3TiSb5, but it is not so clear in the case of U3ScSb5. A change in sign of the thermopower occurs below TC for both compounds, characteristic of multiband conducting systems.", "ISSN": "0897-4756", "pub": "CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS", "volume": "18", "authors": ["Mar, A", "Tougait, O", "Potel, M", "Noel, H", "Lopes, EB"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm061281y", "issue": "18", "pages": "4533-4540"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2004", "title": "Refinement of the crystal structures of titanium diantimonide, TiSb2, and vanadium diantimonide,V0.96Sb2", "abstract": "Sb2Ti, tetragonal, I4/mcm (no. 140), a = 6.6528(2) Angstrom, c = 5.8071(3) Angstrom, V = 257.0 Angstrom(3), Z = 4, rho(meas) = 7.522(6) g/cm(3), rho(calc) = 7.531 g/cm(3), R-gt(F) = 0.013, wR(ref)(F-2) = 0.029, T = 293 K.\n\nSb2V0.96, tetragonal, I4/mcm (no. 140), a = 6.5538(1) Angstrom, c = 5.6366(2) Angstrom, V = 242.1 Angstrom(3), Z = 4, rho(meas) = 8.024(6) g/cm(3), rho(calc) = 8.019 g/cm(3), R-gt(F) = 0.019, wR(ref)(F-2) = 0.054, T = 293 K.", "ISSN": "1433-7266", "pub": "ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KRISTALLOGRAPHIE-NEW CRYSTAL STRUCTURES", "volume": "219", "authors": ["Armbruster, M", "Gil, RC", "Burkhardt, U", "Grin, Y"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "209-210"}]], [{"formation_energy_per_atom": -0.8864423345312495, "band_gap": 0.0, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.\n\nResults On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [Cis]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases, Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% Cis) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1,03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10000 1 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10000 person-years.\n\nConclusions Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.", "ISSN": "0098-7484", "pub": "JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION", "volume": "288", "authors": ["Rossouw, JE", "Anderson, GL", "Prentice, RL", "LaCroix, AZ", "Kooperberg, C", "Stefanick, ML", "Jackson, RD", "Beresford, SAA", "Howard, BV", "Johnson, KC", "Kotchen, JM", "Ockene, J"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "321-333"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0092-8674(93)90500-P", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286749390500P/pdf?md5=27606d8ccfa9a6f299690b069027e424&pid=1-s2.0-009286749390500P-main.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 19 1993", "title": "WAF1, A POTENTIAL MEDIATOR OF P53 TUMOR SUPPRESSION", "abstract": "The ability of p53 to activate transcription from specific sequences suggests that genes induced by p53 may mediate its biological role as a tumor suppressor.

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters (K) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic Delta K based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested.

However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's Linear Discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions.

In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations.\n\nMethods 20 536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These \"Intention-to-treat\"comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.\n\nFindings All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10 269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10 267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0-4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% Cl 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and-most notably-even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.\n\nInterpretation Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.", "ISSN": "0140-6736", "pub": "LANCET", "volume": "360", "authors": ["Collins, R", "Armitage, J", "Parish, S", "Sleight, P", "Peto, R"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "9326", "pages": "7-22"}, {"DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa020047", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "SEP 26 2002", "title": "Peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.", "abstract": "Background: Treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a alone produces significantly higher sustained virologic responses than treatment with interferon alfa-2a alone in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD.

Electrochemical extraction was limited to similar to 0.6 Li/formula unit; but even with this restriction the specific capacity is 100 to 110 mAh/g.

The FePO4 framework of the ordered olivine LiFePO4 is retained with minor displacive adjustments. Nevertheless the insertion/extraction reaction eless proceeds via a two-phase process, and a reversible loss in capacity with increasing current density appears to be associated with a diffusion-limited transfer of lithium across the two-phase interface. Electrochemical extraction of lithium from isostructural LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Co, or Ni) with an LiClO4 electrolyte was not possible; but successful extraction of lithium from LiFe1-xMnxPO4 was accomplished with maximum oxidation of the Mn3+/Mn2+ occurring at x = 0.5.

We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients.\n\nMethods: Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28.\n\nResults: The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11; P=0.007).

Reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells within a limited period after transfer of CD4(+)CD25(-) cells prevented these autoimmune developments in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the reconstitution several days later, or inoculation of an equivalent dose of CD8(+) cells, was far less efficient for the prevention. When nu/nu mice were transplanted with allogeneic skins or immunized with xenogeneic proteins at the time of CD25(-) cell inoculation, they showed significantly heightened immune responses to the skins or proteins, and reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells normalized the responses. Taken together, these results indicate that CD4(+)CD25(+) cells contribute to maintaining self-tolerance by down-regulating immune response to self and non-self Ags in an Ag-nonspecific manner, presumably at the T cell activation stage; elimination/reduction of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells relieves this general suppression, thereby not only enhancing immune responses to non-self Ags, but also eliciting autoimmune responses to certain self-Ags.

We studied whether inflammation increases the risk of a first thrombotic event and whether treatment with aspirin decreases the risk.\n\nMethods We measured plasma C-reactive protein, a marker for systemic inflammation, in 543 apparently healthy men participating in the Physicians' Health Study in whom myocardial infarction, stroke, or venous thrombosis subsequently developed, and in 543 study participants who did not report vascular disease during a follow-up period exceeding eight years. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or placebo at the beginning of the trial.\n\nResults Base-line plasma C-reactive protein concentrations were higher among men who went on to have myocardial infarction (1.51 vs. 1.13 mg per liter, P<0.001) or ischemic stroke (1.38 vs. 1.13 mg per liter, P=0.02), but not venous th rombosis (1.26 vs. 1.13 mg per liter, P=0.34), than among men without vascular events. The men in the quartile with the highest C-reactive protein values had three times the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 2.9; P<0.001) and two times the risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk, 1.9; P=0.02) of the men in the lowest quartile. Risks were stable over long periods, were not modified by smoking, and were independent of other lipid-related and non-lipid-related risk factors. The use of aspirin was associated with significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction (55.7 percent reduction, P=0.02) among men in the highest quartile but with only small, nonsignificant reductions among those in the lowest quartile (13.9 percent, P=0.77).\n\nConclusions The base-line plasma concentration of C-reactive protein predicts the risk of future myocardial infarction and stroke. Moreover, the reduction associated with the use of aspirin in the risk of a first myocardial infarction appears to be directly related to the level of C-reactive protein, raising the possibility that antiinflammatory agents may have clinical benefits in preventing cardiovascular disease.

In vertebrates, five distinct DNA binding subunits are currently known which might extensively heterodimerize, thereby forming complexes with distinct transcriptional activity, DNA sequence specificity, and cell type- and cell stage-specific distribution. The activity of DNA binding NF-kappa B dimers is tightly controlled by accessory proteins called I kappa B subunits of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates. I kappa B proteins inhibit DNA binding and prevent nuclear uptake of NF-kappa B complexes. An exception is the Bcl-3 protein which in addition can function as a transcription activating subunit in the nucleus. Other I kappa B proteins are rather involved in terminating NF-kappa B's activity in the nucleus. The intracellular events that lead to the inactivation of I kappa B, i.e. the activation of NF-kappa B, are complex. They involve phosphorylation and proteolytic reactions and seem to be controlled by the cells' redox status. Interference with the activation or activity of NF-kappa B may be beneficial in suppressing toxic/septic shock, graft-vs-host reactions, acute inflammatory reactions, acute phase response, and radiation damage. The inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by antioxidants and specific protease inhibitors may provide a pharmacological basis for interfering with these acute processes.", "ISSN": "0732-0582", "pub": "ANNUAL REVIEW OF IMMUNOLOGY", "volume": "12", "authors": ["BAEUERLE, PA", "HENKEL, T"], "DOIlink": "http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.iy.12.040194.001041", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "141-179"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604170189/pdfft?md5=1db8f305a9c80ef6a5ff95bd86f8f830&pid=1-s2.0-S0140673604170189-main.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 11 2004", "title": "Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): case-control study", "abstract": "Background Although more than 80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown.\n\nMethods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15152 cases and 14820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated.\n\nFindings Smoking (odds ratio 2.87 for current vs never, PAR 35.7% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3.25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49.2% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1.91, PAR 17.9%), diabetes (2.37, PAR 9.9%), abdominal obesity (1.12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1.62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20.1% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2.67, PAR 32.5%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0 . 70, PAR 13.7% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0 . 91, PAR 6.7%), and regular physical activity (0 . 86, PAR 12.2%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0 . 0001 for all risk factors and p=0 . 03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women.\n\nInterpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages; in all regions. his finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.", "ISSN": "0140-6736", "pub": "LANCET", "volume": "364", "authors": ["Yusuf, S", "Hawken, S", "Ounpuu, S", "Dans, T", "Avezum, A", "Lanas, F", "McQueen, M", "Budaj, A", "Pais, P", "Varigos, J", "Liu, LS"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604170189", "issue": "9438", "pages": "937-952"}, {"DOI": "10.1056/NEJM200103083441001", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 8 2001", "title": "Efficacy and safety of recombinant human activated protein C for severe sepsis.", "abstract": "Background: Drotrecogin alfa (activated), or recombinant human activated protein C, has antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties. In a previous study, drotrecogin alfa activated produced dose-dependent reductions in the levels of markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients with severe sepsis. In this phase 3 trial, we assessed whether treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated reduced the rate of death from any cause among patients with severe sepsis.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients with systemic inflammation and organ failure due to acute infection were enrolled and assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either placebo or drotrecogin alfa activated (24 microg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for a total duration of 96 hours. The prospectively defined primary end point was death from any cause and was assessed 28 days after the start of the infusion. Patients were monitored for adverse events; changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and the results of microbiologic cultures; and the development of neutralizing antibodies against activated protein C.\n\nResults: A total of 1690 randomized patients were treated (840 in the placebo group and 850 in the drotrecogin alfa activated group). The mortality rate was 30.8 percent in the placebo group and 24.7 percent in the drotrecogin alfa activated group. On the basis of the prospectively defined primary analysis, treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of death of 19.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.6 to 30.5) and an absolute reduction in the risk of death of 6.1 percent (P = 0.005). The incidence of serious bleeding was higher in the drotrecogin alfa activated group than in the placebo group (3.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent, P = 0.06).\n\nConclusions: Treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.\n\nDesign.-A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nSetting.-Outpatient clinics in Texas.\n\nParticipants.-A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C las characterized by lipid percentiles for an age-and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III).

Balloon-expandable coronary-artery stents were developed to prevent coronary restenosis after coronary angioplasty. These devices hold coronary vessels open at sites that have been dilated. However, it is unknown whether stenting improves longterm angiographic and clinical outcomes as compared with standard balloon angioplasty.\n\nMethods. A total of 520 patients with stable angina and a single coronary-artery lesion were randomly assigned to either stent implantation (262 patients) or standard balloon angioplasty (258 patients). The primary clinical end points were death, the occurrence of a cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, the need for coronary-artery bypass surgery, or a second percutaneous intervention involving the previously treated lesion, either at the time of the initial procedure or during the subsequent seven months. The primary angiographic end point was the minimal luminal diameter at follow-up, as determined by quantitative coronary angiography.\n\nResults. After exclusions, 52 patients in the stent group (20 percent) and 76 patients in the angioplasty group (30 percent) reached a primary clinical end point (relative risk, 0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.92; P = 0.02). The difference in clinical-event rates was explained mainly by a reduced need for a second coronary angioplasty in the stent group (relative risk, 0.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.85; P = 0.005). The mean (+/-SD) minimal luminal diameters immediately after the procedure were 2.48+/-0.39 mm in the stent group and 2.05+/-0.33 mm in the angioplasty group; at follow-up, the diameters were 1.82+/-0.64 mm in the stent group and 1.73+/-0.55 mm in the angioplasty group (P = 0.09), which correspond to rates of restenosis (diameter of stenosis, greater than or equal to 50 percent) of 22 and 32 percent, respectively (P = 0.02). Peripheral vascular complications necessitating surgery, blood transfusion, or both were more frequent after stenting than after balloon angioplasty (13.5 vs. 3.1 percent, P<0.001).

Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have potentially serious adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate.\n\nMethods CAPRIE was a randomised, blinded, international trial designed to assess the relative efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome cluster of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; their relative safety was also assessed. The population studied comprised subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic Vascular disease manifested as either recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years.\n\nFindings 19 185 patients, with more than 6300 in each of the clinical subgroups, were recruited over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1 . 91 years. There were 1960 first events included in the outcome cluster on which an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with clopidogrel had an annual 5 . 32% risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5 . 83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statisticaly significant (p=0 . 043) relative-risk reduction of 8 . 7% in favour of clopidogrel (95% CI 0 . 3-16 . 5). Corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative-risk reduction of 9 . 4%. There were no major differences in terms of safety. Reported adverse experiences in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups judged to be severe included rash (0 . 26% vs 0 . 10%), diarrhoea (0 . 23% vs 0 . 11%), upper gastrointestinal discomfort (0 . 97% vs 1 . 22%), intracranial haemorrhage (0 . 33% vs 0 . 47%), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0 . 52% vs 0 . 72%), respectively. There were ten (0 . 10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with significant reductions in neutrophils (<1 . 2 X 10(9)/L) and 16 (0 . 17%) in the aspirin group.\n\nInterpretation Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.

Coronary-stent placement is a new technique in which a balloon-expandable, stainless-steel, slotted tube is implanted at the site of a coronary stenosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of stent placement and standard balloon angioplasty on angiographically detected restenosis and clinical outcomes.\n\nMethods. We randomly assigned 410 patients with symptomatic coronary disease to elective placement of a Palmaz-Schatz stent or to standard balloon angioplasty. Coronary angiography was performed at base line, immediately after the procedure, and six months later.\n\nResults. The patients who underwent stenting had a higher rate of procedural success than those who underwent standard balloon angioplasty (96.1 percent vs. 89.6 percent, P = 0.011), a larger immediate increase in the diameter of the lumen (1.72+/-0.46 vs. 1.23+/-0.48 mm, P<0.001), and a larger luminal diameter immediately after the procedure (2.49+/-0.43 vs. 1.99+/-0.47 mm, P<0.001). At six months, the patients with stented lesions continued to have a larger luminal diameter (1.74+/-0.60 vs. 1.56+/-0.65 mm, P = 0.007) and a lower rate of restenosis (31.6 percent vs. 42.1 percent, P = 0.046) than those treated with balloon angioplasty. There were no coronary events (death; myocardial infarction; coronary-artery bypass surgery; vessel closure, including stent thrombosis; or repeated angioplasty) in 80.5 percent of the patients in the stent group and 76.2 percent of those in the angioplasty group (P = 0.16).

Controlled clinical trials have shown that beta-blockers can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in chronic heart failure, but the effect of these drugs on survival has not been determined.\n\nMethods. We enrolled 1094 patients with chronic heart failure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified program, in which patients were assigned to one of four treatment protocols on the basis of their exercise capacity. Within each of the four protocols patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 398) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (n = 696); background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Patients were observed for the occurrence of death or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons during the following 6 months (12 months for the group with mild heart failure).\n\nResults. The overall mortality rate was 7.8 percent in the placebo group and 3.2 percent in the carvedilol group; the reduction in risk attributable to carvedilol was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 80 percent; P < 0.001). This finding led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend termination of the study before its scheduled completion. in addition, as compared with placebo, carvedilol therapy was accompanied by a 27 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (19.6 percent vs. 14.1 percent, P = 0.036), as well as a 38 percent reduction in the combined risk of hospitalization or death (24.5 percent vs. 15.8 percent, P < 0.001). Worsening heart failure as an adverse reaction during treatment was less frequent in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group.\n\nConclusions. Carvedilol reduces the risk of death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.

Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (SD 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (x(1)(2) = 52.0, 2p < 0.00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (X-1(2) = 8.8, 2p = 0.003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10.9% (SD 2.5) for node-positive (61.4% vs 50.5% survival, 2p < 0.00001) and 5.6% (SD 1.3) for node-negative (78.9% vs 73.3% survival, 2p < 0.00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied tie, including those with \"ER-poor\" tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13% (SD 13), 26% (SD 9), and 47% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer, Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0.99 [SD 0.05]).\n\nInterpretation. For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments.", "ISSN": "0140-6736", "pub": "LANCET", "volume": "351", "authors": ["Clarke, M", "Collins, R", "Davies, C", "Godwin, J", "Gray, R", "Peto, R"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "9114", "pages": "1451-1467"}, {"DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa013168", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "JUN 13 2002", "title": "Cardiac resynchronization in chronic heart failure", "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have suggested that cardiac resynchronization achieved through atrial-synchronized biventricular pacing produces clinical benefits in patients with heart failure who have an intraventricular conduction delay.

We conducted a randomized trial to compare CHOP chemotherapy plus rituximab with CHOP alone in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.\n\nMethods: Previously untreated patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, 60 to 80 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either eight cycles of CHOP every three weeks (197 patients) or eight cycles of CHOP plus rituximab given on day 1 of each cycle (202 patients).\n\nResults: The rate of complete response was significantly higher in the group that received CHOP plus rituximab than in the group that received CHOP alone (76 percent vs. 63 percent, P=0.005).

ZrTe3 is a material that undergoes a transition to a charge density wave state at 63 K and displays superconductivity below 2 K. The results of photoemission measurements using synchrotron radiation as well as temperature dependent resistivity and thermopower data allow one to sketch a detailed experimental picture of the electronic structure at the Fermi level. High level TB-LMTO-ASA band structure calculations are used to analyze the bonding situation in ZrTe3 and to relate the physical properties of the crystal to the electronic structure. ZrTe3 is a layered material whose structure is built up from trigonal prismatic ZrTe3 chains with extensive Te-Te interactions perpendicular to the chain direction. These Te-Te interactions lead to wide bands in the direction perpendicular to the chains of trigonal prisms. Frozen phonon calculations indicate that the density of states at the Fermi level and the shape of the Fermi surface are strongly dependent on the Te-Te interprism interactions. The complete computed Fermi surface consists of three independent envelopes: two sheet-like surfaces which are associated with the atoms of the Te, group and a cylindrical section, the former one being responsible for the observed charge density wave properties of ZrTe3. The experimental and calculated nesting vectors for the charge density wave are in excellent agreement. A comparison of the band structures of ZrTe3 with those of the isostructural HfTe3 and ThTe3 reveals that HfTe3 should exhibit similar electronic properties as ZrTe3, whereas ThTe3 should be semimetallic. Based on the results of the frozen phonon calculations, we predict a strong pressure dependence of the physical properties of ZrTe3 and HfTe3.", "ISSN": "0959-9428", "pub": "JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY", "volume": "8", "authors": ["Felser, C", "Finckh, EW", "Kleinke, H", "Rocker, F", "Tremel, W"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1998/JM/a802948b", "issue": "8", "pages": "1787-1798"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.121406", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/apl/72/16/1.121406.pdf;jsessionid=cauosbba2euy.x-aip-live-02?itemId=/content/aip/journal/apl/72/16/10.1063/1.121406&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/apl", "pubDate": "APR 20 1998", "title": "Effect of Ti substitution on the thermoelectric properties of the pentatelluride materials M1-xTixTe5 (M = Hf, Zr)", "abstract": "The thermoelectric properties (resistivity and thermopower) of single crystals of the low dimensional pentatelluride materials, HfTe5 and ZrTe5, have been measured as a function of temperature from 10 K<T<320 K.

In addition, a comparative analysis of Debye-Waller factors obtained in the different coordination shells (Te-Te, Te-Nb, Nb-Te and Nb-Nb) shows an evidence of correlation in the vibrational motion.

Three types are distinguished: Layered materials with CdI2 type, the CeCd2 type which is a slight distortion of the hexagonal AlB2 type, and the intermediate EuGe2 type made of the materials AuTe2, BaSi2, EuGe2, and SrGe2. Ab initio modeling of the 26 entries with CdI2 and EuGe2 type and atomic coordinates reproduces convincingly both their c/a axial ratios and z coordinates. For CoO2 and SiTe2, both c/a and z deviate to a degree from the reported values, indicating that those materials should be reexamined for superstructures, stoichiometry, etc. Ab initio modeling of the 11 cell-and-type entries with CdI2-type and no coordinates in CRYSTMET reproduced convincingly their reported axial ratios. The X-ray cell data and the ab initio z coordinates were then used in the production of reliable calculated powder patterns for CoTe2, CrSe2, HfS2, HfSe2, HfTe2, NbTe2, SnSe2, VS2, VTe2, ZrS2, and ZrTe2. All 11 patterns have been inserted in the intense diffraction line search system of CRYSTMET operated under the Materials Toolkit.

X-ray diffraction data revealed that the pentatelluride structure prevails at all doping concentrations. With increasing Sb concentration, the linewidths for three of the four Raman peaks observed at 115, 120, and 147 cm(-1) in the parent material broadened with insignificant change in the linewidth for the fourth peak at 180 cm(-1). Interestingly, the peak intensity for the mode at 180 cm(-1) gradually diminishes in ZrTe5-xSbx up to x=0.15, and completely vanishes in the x=0.20 compound.

In this work we have developed a simple scaling that systematizes the T = 0 energy difference DELTAE(W-ZB) between W and ZB for all simple binary semiconductors. We have first calculated the energy difference DELTAE(W-ZB)LDF (AB) for AlN, GaN, InN, AlP, AlAs, GaP, GaAs, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, C, and Si using a numerically precise implementation of the first-principles local-density formalism (LDF), including structural relaxations. We then find a linear scaling between DELTAE(W-ZB)LDF (AB) and an atomistic orbital-radii coordinate R (A,B) that depends only on the properties of the free atoms A and B making up the binary compound AB. Unlike classical structural coordinates (electronegativity, atomic sizes, electron count), R is an orbital-dependent quantity; it is calculated from atomic pseudopotentials. The good linear fit found between DELTAE(W-ZB) and R (rms error of approximately 3 meV/atom) permits predictions of the W-ZB energy difference for many more AB compounds than the 13 used in establishing this fit. We use this model to identify chemical trends in DELTAE(W-ZB) in the IV-IV, III-V, II-VI, and I-VII octet compounds as either the anion or the cation are varied.

This indicates that even small changes in ordinary light exposure during the late evening hours can significantly affect both plasma melatonin concentrations and the entrained phase of the human circadian pacemaker.", "ISSN": "0022-3751", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON", "volume": "526", "authors": ["Zeitzer, JM", "Dijk, DJ", "Kronauer, RE", "Brown, EN", "Czeisler, CA"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "695-702"}, {"DOI": "10.1149/1.1390819", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/content/2/7/307.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "JUL 1999", "title": "Li(x)Cu(6)Sn(5) (0 < x < 13): An intermetallic insertion electrode for rechargeable lithium batteries", "abstract": "It has been discovered that lithium can be inserted into the intermetallic compound Cu(6)Sn(5) in a two-phase reaction to yield the product Li(x)Cu(6)Sn(5) (x approximate to 13). This finding has important implications for designing new intermetallic insertion electrodes (anodes) for rechargeable lithium batteries. The theoretical capacity of LixCu(6)Sn(5) derived from the eta-phase, eta-Cu(6)Sn(5), with a NiAs-type structure is 358 mAh/g for x(max) = 13, which corresponds to a fully lithiated composition Li(2.17)CuSn(0.83); this capacity is close to the theoretical capacity of lithiated graphite LiC(6) (372 mAh/g). The reaction occurs at approximately 0.4 V vs. lithium metal. The best cycling efficiency is obtained when the end voltage is restricted to 200 mV above the potential of lithium metal. A mechanism is proposed for the insertion of lithium into eta-Cu(6)Sn(5). (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society. S1099-0062(99)01-079-4.

Here we report estimates of the ground displacement associated with this event, using near-field Global Positioning System ( GPS) surveys in northwestern Sumatra combined with in situ and remote observations of the vertical motion of coral reefs. These data show that the earthquake was generated by rupture of the Sunda subduction megathrust over a distance of >1,500 kilometres and a width of,150 kilometres. Megathrust slip exceeded 20 metres offshore northern Sumatra, mostly at depths shallower than 30 kilometres. Comparison of the geodetically and seismically inferred slip distribution indicates that,30 per cent additional fault slip accrued in the 1.5 months following the 500-second-long seismic rupture.

The coseismic model shows that the Sunda subduction megathrust ruptured over a distance of about 1500 km and a width of less than 150 km, releasing a total moment of 6.7-7.0 X 1022 N in, equivalent to a magnitude M, similar to 9.15. The latitudinal distribution of released moment in our model has three distinct peaks at about 4 degrees N, 7 degrees N, and 9 degrees N, which compares well to the latitudinal variations seen in the seismic inversion and of the analysis of radiated T waves. Our coseismic model is also consistent with interpretation of normal modes and with the amplitude of very-long-period surface waves. The tsunami predicted from this model fits relatively well the altimetric measurements made by the JASON and TOPEX satellites. Neither slow nor delayed slip is needed to explain the normal modes and the tsunami wave. The near-field geodetic data that encompass both coseismic deformation and up to 40 days of postseismic deformation require that slip must have continued on the plate interface after the 500-sec-long seismic rupture.

Oxaliplatin is a new cytotoxic agent from the diaminocyclohexane family with proven antitumor activity against colon cancer cell lines. Activity in patients with colorectal carcinoma previously treated with 5-fluorouracil has been studied in three single-agent phase II trials, showing a reproducible response rate of 10%. Here we report a phase II trial with oxaliplatin as a first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nPatients and methods: Twenty-five patients were entered in the study. All of them had metastatic disease without previous chemotherapy, and at least one lesion had to be measurable by computed tomography (CT). Therapy consisted of a two-hour infusion of oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m(2) every 21 days.\n\nResults. The overall response rate determined by investigators was 20% (95% CI, 6.8%-40.7%). Eight patients (32%) had stable disease. The median time to disease progression in responders was six months (range four to nine). The median progression-free survival nias four months and median overall survival 14.5 months (95% CI, 10-20 months). The main toxic effects were peripheral neuropathy (92%) and laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia (75%). No severe grade 3-4 neurotoxicities (NCI-CTC) were found. Gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities were mild.\n\nConclusions. Oxaliplatin is an active agent in first-line chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. It was well tolerated, caused no toxic deaths, had low hematotoxicity, well controlled gastrointestinal toxicity, and frequent but mild peripheral neurological symptoms. Therefore, it is of interest to associate oxaliplatin with other active compounds.", "ISSN": "0923-7534", "pub": "ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY", "volume": "9", "authors": ["Diaz-Rubio, E", "Sastre, J", "Zaniboni, A", "Labianca, R", "Cortes-Funes, H", "de Braud, F", "Boni, C", "Benavides, M", "Dallavalle, G", "Homerin, M"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008200825886", "issue": "1", "pages": "105-108"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/cm980322q", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860999536/cmatex-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 1998", "title": "Synthesis and characterization of surface-protected nanocrystalline titania particles", "abstract": "Monodisperse nonaggregated nanoparticles of titania are obtained through hydrolysis at 60 degrees C of titanium butoxide in the presence of acetylacetone and para-toluenesulfonic acid.

Because of the increased frequency of PCOS in obese women we tested the hypothesis that alterations in serum leptin concentrations might be associated with PCOS. Immunoreactive leptin concentrations were measured in 58 women with PCOS and 70 regularly menstruating (control) women. As has previously been shown there nias a positive correlation between leptin levels and body mass index (BMI). Although the leptin levels in the majority of women with PCOS fell within the control range, 29% of PCOS women had leptin levels above the 99% prediction interval for their BMI and none had low leptin levels. There were also positive correlations of leptin levels with free testosterone and insulin sensitivity in control women. In women with PCOS, 13% and 9.5% exhibited higher than expected leptin concentrations with respect to free testosterone and insulin sensitivity, respectively. Insulin resistant PCOS women had higher leptin levels than controls.

These studies have focused on a range of PLA-PEG copolymers with a fixed PEG block (5 kDa) and a varying PLA segment (3-110 kDa). In aqueous media, these copolymers formed micellar-like assemblies following precipitation from water miscible solvents. There was a controlled increase in the particle size as the molecular weight of the PLA block nias increased. The characteristics of the PEG corona were also highly dependent on the PLA moiety. Copolymers with a low molecular weight PLA block (3-15 kDa) formed highly colloidally stable dispersions, with a complete PEG surface coverage. However, increasing the molecular weight of the PLA block resulted in significantly less colloidally stable nanoparticle dispersions, which flocculated in solvents that were significantly better than theta-solvents for the stabilising PEG chains. This can be attributed to a reduced PEG surface coverage and the probable presence of naked PLA 'patches' on the particle surface. These larger PLA-PEG nanoparticles (30:5-110:5) were found to be stabilised in the presence of serum components, which are thought to adsorb into the gaps on the particle surface and prevent flocculation. All of the dispersions were found to be stable under physiological conditions and therefore suitable for in vivo administration. A reasonable loading (3.1% w/w) of the micellar-like PLA-PEG 30:5 nanoparticles with the water soluble drug procaine hydrochloride was achieved. The incorporated drug was found to have no effect on the nanoparticle structure or recovery, which can be attributed to the micellar character of these assemblies and the presence of the stabilising PEG chains.

Recently P wave dispersion (PWD), which is believed to reflect inhomogeneous atrial conduction, has been proposed as being useful for the prediction of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Ninety consecutive patients (46 men, 44 women; aged 55 +/- 13 years) with a history of idiopathic PAF and 70 healthy subjects (42 men, 28 women; mean age 53 +/- 14 years) were studied. The P wave duration was calculated in all 12 leads of the surface EGG. The difference between the maximum and minimum P wave duration was calculated and this difference nias defined as P wave dispersion (PWD = Pmax - Pmin). All patients and controls were also evaluated by echocardiography to measure the left atrial diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There was no difference between patients and controls in gender (P = 0.26), age (P = 0.12), LVEF (66 +/- 4% vs 67 +/- 5%, P = 0.8) and left atrial diameter (36 +/- 4 mm vs 34 +/- 6 mm, P = 0.13). P maximum duration was found to be significantly higher in patients with a history of PAF (116 +/- 17 ms) than controls (101 +/- 11 ms, P < 0.001). P wave dispersion was also significantly higher in patients than in controls (44 +/- 25 ms vs 27 +/- 10 ms, P < 0.001). There was a weak correlation between age and P wave dispersion (r = 0.27, P < 0.001). A P maximum value of 106 ms separated patients with PAF from control subjects r with a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 72%, and a positive predictive accuracy of 79%. A P wave dispersion value of 36 ms separated patients from control subjects with a sensitivity of 77%, a specificity of 82%, and a positive predictive accuracy of 85%.

Based on these findings, we further propose substrates on which the growth may be accomplished with minimum strain. Our findings are supported by the recent successful synthesis of ZB CrAs on GaAs and ZB CrSb on GaSb, where our predicted equilibrium lattice constants are within 0.5% of the lattice constants of the substrates on which the growth was accomplished. We confirm previous theoretical results for ZB MnAs, but find ZB MnSb to be half metallic at its equilibrium lattice constant, whereas previous work has found it to be only nearly so. We report here two low-strain half metallic ZB compounds, CrP and MnC, and suggest appropriate substrates for each. Unlike the other five compounds, we predict ZB MnC to become/remain half metallic with compression rather than expansion, and to exhibit metallicity in the minority- rather than majority-spin channel. These fundamentally different properties of MnC can be connected to substantially greater p-d hybridization and d-d overlap, and correspondingly larger bonding-antibonding splitting and smaller exchange splitting.

Correlation effects include the emergence of long-range order, of liquid-like or crystalline structures and collective dynamic properties (collective modes). The observation and experimental analysis of strong correlations are often difficult, requiring, in many cases, extreme conditions such as very low temperatures or high densities. An exception is complex plasmas where strong coupling can be easily achieved, even at room temperature. These systems feature the strongest correlations reported so far and experiments allow for an unprecedented precision and full single-particle resolution of the stationary and time-dependent many-particle behavior.\n\nThe governing role of the interactions in strongly correlated systems gives rise to many universal properties observed in all of them. This makes the analysis of one particular system interesting for many others. This motivates the goal of this paper which is to give an overview on recent experimental and theoretical results in complex plasmas including liquid-like behavior, crystal formation, structural and dynamic properties.

The free energy (at zero temperature) is calculated as a function of pressure for AlN in the wurtzite, zinc-blende, rocksalt, nickel arsenide, anti-NiAs, and beta-tin structures. According to the calculations the wurtzite structure is stable from zero pressure (P) up to almost-equal-to 12.5 GPa, where AlN transforms into the rocksalt phase. The volume reduction is 19%. The volume change agrees with recent experiments, but the transition pressure is lower than observed, presumably due to the LDA.

Another transformation is predicted at higher pressures, and the calculations suggest that this structure could be similar to that of NiAs, but with c/a = 1.72.

EMGs were recorded with surface electrodes from the soleus, the medial and lateral head of the gastrocnemius, the vastus lateralis and the anterior tibial muscles. The EMGs and the soleus H reflex were recorded while walking on a treadmill at 4.5 km h(-1) and during running at 8, 12 and 15 km h(-1).\n\n3. The amplitudes of the M wave and the Ii reflex were normalized to the amplitude of a maximal M wave elicited by a supramaximal stimulus just after the H reflex to compensate for movements of the recording and stimulus electrodes relative to the nerve and muscle fibres. The stimulus intensity was set to produce M waves that had an amplitude near to 25% of the maximal M wave measured during the movements. As an alternative, the method of averaging of sweeps in sixteen intervals of the gait cycle was applied to the data. In this case the amplitude of the H reflex nias expressed relative to the maximal M ware measured whilst in the standing position.\n\n4. The amplitude of the H reflex was modulated during the gait cycle at all speeds. During the stance phase the reflex was facilitated and during the swing and flight phases it was suppressed. The size of the maximal M wave varied during the gait cycle and this variation was consistent for each subject although different among subjects.\n\n5. The peak amplitude of the H reflex increased significant,ly (P = 0.04) from walking at 4 5 km h(-1) to running at 12 and 15 km h(-1) when using the method of correcting for variations of the maximal M wave during the gait cycle. The sweep averaging method showed a small but non-significant decrease (P = 0 3) from walking to running at 8 km h(-1) and a small decrease with running speed (P = 0 3). The amplitude of the EMG increased from walking to running and with running speed.\n\n6.

ELISA was used to measure circulating VEGF immunoreactivity in umbilical vein serum samples and immunohistochemistry was used to determine tissue expression of the protein. Since VEGF is known to be upregulated by hypoxia, the expression pattern of VEGF would provide further clues to the oxygen status in the placentae at the time of sampling, presently a subject under great debate. The geometric mean concentration of VEGF immunoreactivity in umbilical vein serum of normal pregnant women was 112.46 pg/ml, in women with pre-eclampsia 50.23 pg/ml and in IUGR alone 175.35 pg/ml. These values were not statistically different from each other. Immunolocalization of VEGF in normal term villous placenta was observed in the syncytiotrophoblast with less intense staining in stromal cells. No qualitative differences in localization of staining between the groups (normal pregnancies, pre-eclampsia, pre-eclampsia plus IUGR, and IUGR) was found. Intensity of staining in stromal cells nias also similar in the groups studied. However, intensity of VEGF immunostaining in syncytiotrophoblast was significantly reduced in the three pathological groups (P<0.02) compared with the control group. These results suggest that reduced VEGF may be responsible, at least in part, for the impaired vascular development which occurs in these conditions. Our results are therefore not consistent with villous placental hypoxia at the time of sample collection. (C) 1997 W. B.

Ferromagnetic materials with half metallic properties are valuable in this respect. Here we present the electronic structure and magnetic properties of binary compounds consisting of 3d transition metals and group V elements, viz., P, Sb, and As in the zinc-blende structure. We demonstrate that compounds of V, Cr, and Mn show half metallic behavior for appropriate lattice constants. By comparing the total energies in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures, we have ascertained that the ferromagnetic phase is stable over the antiferromagnetic one. Of the different compounds studied, the Cr based systems exhibit the strongest interatomic exchange interactions, and are hence predicted to have the highest critical temperatures. Also, we predict that VAs under certain growth conditions should be a semiconducting ferromagnet. Moreover, critical temperatures of selected half metallic compounds have been estimated from mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations using parameters obtained from a ab initio noncollinear, tight binding linearized muffin-tin orbital method. From a simple model, we calculate the reflectance from an ideal MnAs/InAs interface considering the band structures of MnAs and InAs.

Ni2p(3/2) peak structures and binding energies reflect two energetic contributions. The major. contribution is that associated with the electrostatic field produced by ejection of the Ni(2p) photoelectron, the minor contribution is the rt laxation energy associated with filling unoccupied, conduction band 3d(9) and 4s Ni metal orbitals. These conduction band orbitals become localized on the Ni photoion (and sometimes filled) in response to the field created by the photoemission event. Because only the core Ni2p electron and nonbonding orbitals of predominantly metallic character are affected, the main peak of all three conductors are affected similarly, leading to similar Ni2P(3/2) main peak binding energies.\n\nNiO, Ni(OH)(2), and NiSO4 are insulators in which Ni is divalent and is bonded to oxygen. Although Ni is bonded to oxide in these phases, Ni2p binding energies differ substantially, and reflect primarily the nature of the ligand (O2-, OH-, SO42-) to which Ni is bonded. The influence of the ligand Is the result of charge (electron) transfer from valence band beading orbitals of dominantly ligand character, to unoccupied conduction band orbitals localized on Ni photoions. Relaxation energy resulting from charge transfer is acquired by the emitted photoelectron, thus Ni2P(3/2) photopeak binding energies of these insulators reflect the nature of the ligand to which Ni is bonded.\n\nThe Ni2p main peak binding energy of these conductors and insulators is a poor guide to Ni oxidation states. The Ni2p(3/2) binding energies of insulators reflect, however, the nature of the ligand in the first coordination sphere of Ni.\n\nThe intensity of the Doniach-Sunjic contribution to Ni2p XPS spectra of NIS and NiAs is dependent on the nature of the ligand.

Annual banding in corals provides vertical rates of deformation spanning the last half of the 20th century, and repeated GPS surveys between 1991 and 2001 and continuous measurements at GPS stations operated since 2002 provide horizontal velocities. Near the equator, the megathrust is locked over a narrow width of only a few tens of kilometers. In contrast, the locked fault zone is up to about 175 km wide in areas where great interplate earthquakes have occurred in the past. Formal inversion of the data reveals that these strongly coupled patches are roughly coincident with asperities that ruptured during these events. The correlation is most spectacular for rupture of the M-w 8.7 Nias-Simeulue earthquake of 2005, which released half of the moment deficit that had accumulated since its previous rupture in 1861, suggesting that this earthquake was overdue. Beneath the Mentawai islands, strong coupling is observed within the overlapping rupture areas of the great earthquakes of 1797 and 1833. The accumulated slip deficit since these events is slowly reaching the amount of slip that occurred during the 1833 earthquake but already exceeds the slip that occurred during the 1797 earthquake. Thus, rerupture of part of the Mentawai patch in September 2007 was not a surprise. In contrast, coupling is low below the Batu islands near the equator and around Enggano island at about 5 degrees S, where only moderate earthquakes (M-w < 8.0) have occurred in the past two centuries. The correlation of large seismic asperities with patches that are locked during the interseismic period suggests that they are persistent features. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the large locked patches and great ruptures occur beneath persistent geomorphologic features, the largest outer arc islands. Depth- and convergence-rate-dependent temperature might influence the pattern of coupling, through its effect on the rheology of the plate interface, but other influences are required to account for the observed along-strike heterogeneity of coupling. In particular, subduction of the Investigator Fracture Zone could be the cause for the low coupling near the equator.", "ISSN": "2169-9313", "pub": "JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH", "volume": "113", "authors": ["Chlieh, M", "Avouac, JP", "Sieh, K", "Natawidjaja, DH", "Galetzka, J"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JB004981", "issue": "B5", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-3697(57)90028-8", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022369757900288/pdf?md5=14ec38f45f7e9a68d4260b99dba7b2de&pid=1-s2.0-0022369757900288-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1957", "title": "SOLID SOLUTIONS BETWEEN FERROMAGNETIC AND ANTIFERROMAGNETIC COMPOUNDS WITH NIAS STRUCTURE", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-3697", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS", "volume": "3", "authors": ["LOTGERING, FK", "GORTER, EW"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022369757900288", "issue": "3-4", "pages": "238-249"}, {"DOI": "10.3767/000651909X475941", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2009", "title": "Southeast Asia's changing palaeogeography", "abstract": "Geology provides the basis for understanding distributions of faunas and floras in Southeast Asia but only via a complex interplay of plate movements, palaeogeography, ocean circulation and climate. Southeast Asia grew incrementally by the addition of continental fragments, mainly rifted from Australia, and added to the margins of Sundaland as a result of subduction. Sundaland was an almost permanent land area from the beginning of the Mesozoic. The addition of the continental fragments of Southwest Borneo and later East Java-West Sulawesi formed a much larger emergent land area by the Late Cretaceous that extended from Indochina to West Sulawesi. Subduction resumed at the Sundaland margin in the Eocene and this led to widespread rifting within Sundaland, and formed one of the most important barriers at its edge, the Makassar Straits. Australia began to collide with Southeast Asia about 25 million years ago, effectively closing the former deep ocean separating the two continents, and forming the region now known as Wallacea. Collision, volcanism, and subduction-related processes have led to rise of mountains but also formed new oceans within this complex region. Plate tectonic movements and collisions were intimately linked to changing topography, bathymetry and land/sea distributions which have in turn influenced oceanic circulation and climate. As the deep-water barrier between Australia and Southeast Asia was eliminated and mountains rose, deep marine basins also formed, Eustatic changes in sea level further contributed to a complex palaeogeography. The present gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans is the only low latitude oceanic passage between the world's oceans, and is an important influence on local and probably global climate.

The amplitude of long period waves better represents the tsunami potential of an earthquake. Because of the fast group velocity of W phase, most of W phase energy is contained within a short time window after the arrival of the P wave. At a distance of 50 degrees, W phase energy is contained within 23 min after the origin time which is the distinct advantage of using W phase for rapid tsunami warning purposes. We use a time domain deconvolution method to extract W phases from the broad-band records of global seismic networks. The bandwidth of W phase is approximately from 0.001 to 0.01 Hz, and we bandpass filter the data from 0.001 to 0.005 Hz in most cases.

Our studies have revealed a far more complex system than previously thought. This paper presents the first extensive investigation in the whole distribution area of myrmecophytic Macaranga. All ant-inhabited species were restricted to the moister parts of SE Asia: Peninsular Malaysia, South and East Thailand, Sumatra and Borneo. We found a rather strict and similar altitudinal zonation of myrmecophytic Macaranga species in all regions. Here we focus on the majority of the 19. Macaranga species obligatorily associated with ants of the genus Crematogaster. We identified a total of 2163 ant queens which belonged to at least eight (morpho)species of the small subgenus Decacrema as well as to one non-Decacrema (probably from Atopogyne). The ant species there not randomly distributed among the Macaranga species but distinct patterns of associations emerged. Despite common sympatric distribution of Macaranga species, in most cases a surprisingly high specificity of ant colonization was maintained which was, however, often not species-specific but groups of certain plant species with identical ant partners could be found. These colonization patterns usually but not always mirror existing taxonomic sections within the genus Macaranga. Possible mechanisms of specificity are discussed.

We apply all-electron and pseudopotential ab initio methods to investigate the electronic and structural properties of ZB Mn and Cr pnictides and carbides, and find six compounds to be half metallic at or near their respective equilibrium lattice constants, making them excellent candidates for growth at low strain. Based on these findings, we further propose substrates on which the growth may be accomplished with minimum strain. Our findings are supported by the recent successful synthesis of ZB CrAs on GaAs and ZB CrSb on GaSb, where our predicted equilibrium lattice constants are within 0.5% of the lattice constants of the substrates on which the growth was accomplished. We confirm previous theoretical results for ZB MnAs, but find ZB MnSb to be half metallic at its equilibrium lattice constant, whereas previous work has found it to be only nearly so. We report here two low-strain half metallic ZB compounds, CrP and MnC, and suggest appropriate substrates for each. Unlike the other five compounds, we predict ZB MnC to become/remain half metallic with compression rather than expansion, and to exhibit metallicity in the minority- rather than majority-spin channel. These fundamentally different properties of MnC can be connected to substantially greater p-d hybridization and d-d overlap, and correspondingly larger bonding-antibonding splitting and smaller exchange splitting.

We demonstrate that compounds of V, Cr, and Mn show half metallic behavior for appropriate lattice constants.

First, there are no harmful gases involved, second it may be built more compact as the working material is a solid and third magnetic refrigerators generate much less noise. Recently, a new class of magnetic refrigerant materials for room-temperature applications was discovered. These new materials have important advantages over existing magnetic coolants: They exhibit a large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in conjunction with a magnetic phase transition of first order. This MCE is, larger than that of Gd metal, which is used in the demonstration refrigerators built to explore the potential of this evolving technology.

This conventional e.m.f. is usually absent for stationary circuits and static magnetic fields. There are also forces that act on the spin of an electron; it has been recently predicted(1,2) that, for circuits that are in part composed of ferromagnetic materials, there arises an e.m.f. of spin origin even for a static magnetic field. This e.m.f. can be attributed to a time-varying magnetization of the host material, such as the motion of magnetic domains in a static magnetic field, and reflects the conversion of magnetic to electrical energy. Here we show that such an e.m.f. can indeed be induced by a static magnetic field in magnetic tunnel junctions containing zinc-blende-structured MnAs quantum nanomagnets. The observed e.m.f. operates on a timescale of approximately 10(2)-10(3) seconds and results from the conversion of the magnetic energy of the superparamagnetic MnAs nanomagnets into electrical energy when these magnets undergo magnetic quantum tunnelling. As a consequence, a huge magnetoresistance of up to 100,000 per cent is observed for certain bias voltages. Our results strongly support the contention that, in magnetic nanostructures, Faraday's law of induction must be generalized to account for forces of purely spin origin. The huge magnetoresistance and e.m.f. may find potential applications in high sensitivity magnetic sensors, as well as in new active devices such as 'spin batteries'.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "458", "authors": ["Hai, PN", "Ohya, S", "Tanaka, M", "Barnes, SE", "Maekawa, S"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7237/full/nature07879.html", "issue": "7237", "pages": "489-U2"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.1807014", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/apl/85/16/1.1807014.pdf;jsessionid=1d97f7r7shqg3.x-aip-live-02?itemId=/content/aip/journal/apl/85/16/10.1063/1.1807014&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/apl", "pubDate": "OCT 18 2004", "title": "Spin injection from Fe3Si into GaAs", "abstract": "We demonstrate room-temperature spin injection from the epitaxially grown ferromagnetic metal Fe3Si into the semiconductor GaAs.

In this work we have developed a simple scaling that systematizes the T = 0 energy difference DELTAE(W-ZB) between W and ZB for all simple binary semiconductors. We have first calculated the energy difference DELTAE(W-ZB)LDF (AB) for AlN, GaN, InN, AlP, AlAs, GaP, GaAs, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, C, and Si using a numerically precise implementation of the first-principles local-density formalism (LDF), including structural relaxations. We then find a linear scaling between DELTAE(W-ZB)LDF (AB) and an atomistic orbital-radii coordinate R (A,B) that depends only on the properties of the free atoms A and B making up the binary compound AB. Unlike classical structural coordinates (electronegativity, atomic sizes, electron count), R is an orbital-dependent quantity; it is calculated from atomic pseudopotentials. The good linear fit found between DELTAE(W-ZB) and R (rms error of approximately 3 meV/atom) permits predictions of the W-ZB energy difference for many more AB compounds than the 13 used in establishing this fit. We use this model to identify chemical trends in DELTAE(W-ZB) in the IV-IV, III-V, II-VI, and I-VII octet compounds as either the anion or the cation are varied. We further find that the ground state of MgTe is the NiAs structure and that CdSe and HgSe are stable in the ZB form.

A method for the analysis of carotenoids in vegetables and fruits is described and data are presented for the carotenoid content of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in the UK. The addition of a solvent modifier (triethylamine) to the mobile phase was shown to improve the recovery of carotenoids from the column from around 60% to over 90%. The linearity and reproducibility of the chromatographic response was investigated and the robustness and reproducibility of the method nias measured using a reference vegetable material developed in the laboratory. Short and longer term reproducibility showed an average CV of around 8% for all carotenoids. Analysis showed that good sources (>1000 mu g/100 g) of lutein were: broccoli, butterhead lettuce, parsley, peas, peppers, spinach and watercress; of lycopene: tomatoes and tomato products; and of beta-carotene: broccoli, carron, greens, butterhead lettuce, mixed vegetables, parsley, spinach and watercress. There was little or no loss of carotenoids on cooking, green vegetables showed an average increase in lutein levels of 24% and in beta-carotene levels of 38%.

This finding has important implications for designing new intermetallic insertion electrodes (anodes) for rechargeable lithium batteries. The theoretical capacity of LixCu(6)Sn(5) derived from the eta-phase, eta-Cu(6)Sn(5), with a NiAs-type structure is 358 mAh/g for x(max) = 13, which corresponds to a fully lithiated composition Li(2.17)CuSn(0.83); this capacity is close to the theoretical capacity of lithiated graphite LiC(6) (372 mAh/g). The reaction occurs at approximately 0.4 V vs. lithium metal. The best cycling efficiency is obtained when the end voltage is restricted to 200 mV above the potential of lithium metal.

Here we report estimates of the ground displacement associated with this event, using near-field Global Positioning System ( GPS) surveys in northwestern Sumatra combined with in situ and remote observations of the vertical motion of coral reefs. These data show that the earthquake was generated by rupture of the Sunda subduction megathrust over a distance of >1,500 kilometres and a width of,150 kilometres. Megathrust slip exceeded 20 metres offshore northern Sumatra, mostly at depths shallower than 30 kilometres. Comparison of the geodetically and seismically inferred slip distribution indicates that,30 per cent additional fault slip accrued in the 1.5 months following the 500-second-long seismic rupture. Both seismic and aseismic slip before our re-occupation of GPS sites occurred on the shallow portion of the megathrust, where the large Aceh tsunami originated.

The coseismic model shows that the Sunda subduction megathrust ruptured over a distance of about 1500 km and a width of less than 150 km, releasing a total moment of 6.7-7.0 X 1022 N in, equivalent to a magnitude M, similar to 9.15. The latitudinal distribution of released moment in our model has three distinct peaks at about 4 degrees N, 7 degrees N, and 9 degrees N, which compares well to the latitudinal variations seen in the seismic inversion and of the analysis of radiated T waves. Our coseismic model is also consistent with interpretation of normal modes and with the amplitude of very-long-period surface waves. The tsunami predicted from this model fits relatively well the altimetric measurements made by the JASON and TOPEX satellites. Neither slow nor delayed slip is needed to explain the normal modes and the tsunami wave. The near-field geodetic data that encompass both coseismic deformation and up to 40 days of postseismic deformation require that slip must have continued on the plate interface after the 500-sec-long seismic rupture. The postseismic geodetic moment of about 2.4 X 10(22) N in (M-w -8.8) is equal to about 30 +/- 5% of the coseismic moment release.

Oxaliplatin is a new cytotoxic agent from the diaminocyclohexane family with proven antitumor activity against colon cancer cell lines. Activity in patients with colorectal carcinoma previously treated with 5-fluorouracil has been studied in three single-agent phase II trials, showing a reproducible response rate of 10%. Here we report a phase II trial with oxaliplatin as a first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nPatients and methods: Twenty-five patients were entered in the study. All of them had metastatic disease without previous chemotherapy, and at least one lesion had to be measurable by computed tomography (CT). Therapy consisted of a two-hour infusion of oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m(2) every 21 days.\n\nResults. The overall response rate determined by investigators was 20% (95% CI, 6.8%-40.7%). Eight patients (32%) had stable disease. The median time to disease progression in responders was six months (range four to nine). The median progression-free survival nias four months and median overall survival 14.5 months (95% CI, 10-20 months). The main toxic effects were peripheral neuropathy (92%) and laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia (75%). No severe grade 3-4 neurotoxicities (NCI-CTC) were found. Gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities were mild.\n\nConclusions. Oxaliplatin is an active agent in first-line chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. It was well tolerated, caused no toxic deaths, had low hematotoxicity, well controlled gastrointestinal toxicity, and frequent but mild peripheral neurological symptoms. Therefore, it is of interest to associate oxaliplatin with other active compounds.", "ISSN": "0923-7534", "pub": "ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY", "volume": "9", "authors": ["Diaz-Rubio, E", "Sastre, J", "Zaniboni, A", "Labianca, R", "Cortes-Funes, H", "de Braud, F", "Boni, C", "Benavides, M", "Dallavalle, G", "Homerin, M"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008200825886", "issue": "1", "pages": "105-108"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/cm980322q", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "OCT 1998", "title": "Synthesis and characterization of surface-protected nanocrystalline titania particles", "abstract": "Monodisperse nonaggregated nanoparticles of titania are obtained through hydrolysis at 60 degrees C of titanium butoxide in the presence of acetylacetone and para-toluenesulfonic acid.

Because of the increased frequency of PCOS in obese women we tested the hypothesis that alterations in serum leptin concentrations might be associated with PCOS. Immunoreactive leptin concentrations were measured in 58 women with PCOS and 70 regularly menstruating (control) women. As has previously been shown there nias a positive correlation between leptin levels and body mass index (BMI). Although the leptin levels in the majority of women with PCOS fell within the control range, 29% of PCOS women had leptin levels above the 99% prediction interval for their BMI and none had low leptin levels. There were also positive correlations of leptin levels with free testosterone and insulin sensitivity in control women. In women with PCOS, 13% and 9.5% exhibited higher than expected leptin concentrations with respect to free testosterone and insulin sensitivity, respectively. Insulin resistant PCOS women had higher leptin levels than controls. The data demonstrate that a substantial proportion of women with PCOS have leptin levels that are higher than expected for their BMI, free testosterone and insulin sensitivity.

These studies have focused on a range of PLA-PEG copolymers with a fixed PEG block (5 kDa) and a varying PLA segment (3-110 kDa). In aqueous media, these copolymers formed micellar-like assemblies following precipitation from water miscible solvents. There was a controlled increase in the particle size as the molecular weight of the PLA block nias increased. The characteristics of the PEG corona were also highly dependent on the PLA moiety. Copolymers with a low molecular weight PLA block (3-15 kDa) formed highly colloidally stable dispersions, with a complete PEG surface coverage. However, increasing the molecular weight of the PLA block resulted in significantly less colloidally stable nanoparticle dispersions, which flocculated in solvents that were significantly better than theta-solvents for the stabilising PEG chains. This can be attributed to a reduced PEG surface coverage and the probable presence of naked PLA 'patches' on the particle surface. These larger PLA-PEG nanoparticles (30:5-110:5) were found to be stabilised in the presence of serum components, which are thought to adsorb into the gaps on the particle surface and prevent flocculation. All of the dispersions were found to be stable under physiological conditions and therefore suitable for in vivo administration. A reasonable loading (3.1% w/w) of the micellar-like PLA-PEG 30:5 nanoparticles with the water soluble drug procaine hydrochloride was achieved. The incorporated drug was found to have no effect on the nanoparticle structure or recovery, which can be attributed to the micellar character of these assemblies and the presence of the stabilising PEG chains.

The annual population mortality was 14.0 per 100 000. Both were higher among elderly people, men, and patients resident in areas of greater social deprivation. Overall case fatality nias 8.2%.

Recently P wave dispersion (PWD), which is believed to reflect inhomogeneous atrial conduction, has been proposed as being useful for the prediction of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Ninety consecutive patients (46 men, 44 women; aged 55 +/- 13 years) with a history of idiopathic PAF and 70 healthy subjects (42 men, 28 women; mean age 53 +/- 14 years) were studied. The P wave duration was calculated in all 12 leads of the surface EGG. The difference between the maximum and minimum P wave duration was calculated and this difference nias defined as P wave dispersion (PWD = Pmax - Pmin). All patients and controls were also evaluated by echocardiography to measure the left atrial diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). There was no difference between patients and controls in gender (P = 0.26), age (P = 0.12), LVEF (66 +/- 4% vs 67 +/- 5%, P = 0.8) and left atrial diameter (36 +/- 4 mm vs 34 +/- 6 mm, P = 0.13). P maximum duration was found to be significantly higher in patients with a history of PAF (116 +/- 17 ms) than controls (101 +/- 11 ms, P < 0.001). P wave dispersion was also significantly higher in patients than in controls (44 +/- 25 ms vs 27 +/- 10 ms, P < 0.001). There was a weak correlation between age and P wave dispersion (r = 0.27, P < 0.001). A P maximum value of 106 ms separated patients with PAF from control subjects r with a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 72%, and a positive predictive accuracy of 79%.

The extensive domain-twinning macroscopically gives rise to perfect hexagonal symmetry, which explains the previously proposed hexagonal cell [a = 5a(NiAs), c = 5c(NiAs); Bernal (1928), Nature, 122, 54]. The structure was solved by occupying every fifth trigonal bipyramidal site of the NiAs-type structure and shifting the atoms surrounding these additional Cu atoms to form Edshammar(11) polyhedra with Cu-Sn and Cu-Cu distances in the range 2.60-2.74 Angstrom. The supercell reflections from the different domains of the twinned crystals are not superimposed, which facilitated the crystal structure refinement [space group C2/c; a = 11.022 (5), b = 7.282 (4), c = 9.827 (2) Angstrom, beta = 98.84 (4)degrees and Z = 4], by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction on a domain-twinned specimen.

We apply all-electron and pseudopotential ab initio methods to investigate the electronic and structural properties of ZB Mn and Cr pnictides and carbides, and find six compounds to be half metallic at or near their respective equilibrium lattice constants, making them excellent candidates for growth at low strain. Based on these findings, we further propose substrates on which the growth may be accomplished with minimum strain. Our findings are supported by the recent successful synthesis of ZB CrAs on GaAs and ZB CrSb on GaSb, where our predicted equilibrium lattice constants are within 0.5% of the lattice constants of the substrates on which the growth was accomplished. We confirm previous theoretical results for ZB MnAs, but find ZB MnSb to be half metallic at its equilibrium lattice constant, whereas previous work has found it to be only nearly so. We report here two low-strain half metallic ZB compounds, CrP and MnC, and suggest appropriate substrates for each. Unlike the other five compounds, we predict ZB MnC to become/remain half metallic with compression rather than expansion, and to exhibit metallicity in the minority- rather than majority-spin channel. These fundamentally different properties of MnC can be connected to substantially greater p-d hybridization and d-d overlap, and correspondingly larger bonding-antibonding splitting and smaller exchange splitting.

Correlation effects include the emergence of long-range order, of liquid-like or crystalline structures and collective dynamic properties (collective modes). The observation and experimental analysis of strong correlations are often difficult, requiring, in many cases, extreme conditions such as very low temperatures or high densities. An exception is complex plasmas where strong coupling can be easily achieved, even at room temperature. These systems feature the strongest correlations reported so far and experiments allow for an unprecedented precision and full single-particle resolution of the stationary and time-dependent many-particle behavior.\n\nThe governing role of the interactions in strongly correlated systems gives rise to many universal properties observed in all of them. This makes the analysis of one particular system interesting for many others. This motivates the goal of this paper which is to give an overview on recent experimental and theoretical results in complex plasmas including liquid-like behavior, crystal formation, structural and dynamic properties.

The free energy (at zero temperature) is calculated as a function of pressure for AlN in the wurtzite, zinc-blende, rocksalt, nickel arsenide, anti-NiAs, and beta-tin structures. According to the calculations the wurtzite structure is stable from zero pressure (P) up to almost-equal-to 12.5 GPa, where AlN transforms into the rocksalt phase. The volume reduction is 19%. The volume change agrees with recent experiments, but the transition pressure is lower than observed, presumably due to the LDA. It is argued that the transition pressure in reality is close to 17 GPa. Another transformation is predicted at higher pressures, and the calculations suggest that this structure could be similar to that of NiAs, but with c/a = 1.72. The transition to the NiAs structure would occur between 30 and 40 GPa, and it is accompanied by a very small volume change. The internal parameters (c/a and u) of the hexagonal phases are optimized by total-energy minimization, and their variation with pressure is derived. At P=0 the internal parameters of wurtzite-AlN are (c/a, u) = (1.596, 0.3820).

The amplitudes of the M wave and the Ii reflex were normalized to the amplitude of a maximal M wave elicited by a supramaximal stimulus just after the H reflex to compensate for movements of the recording and stimulus electrodes relative to the nerve and muscle fibres. The stimulus intensity was set to produce M waves that had an amplitude near to 25% of the maximal M wave measured during the movements. As an alternative, the method of averaging of sweeps in sixteen intervals of the gait cycle was applied to the data. In this case the amplitude of the H reflex nias expressed relative to the maximal M ware measured whilst in the standing position.\n\n4.

ELISA was used to measure circulating VEGF immunoreactivity in umbilical vein serum samples and immunohistochemistry was used to determine tissue expression of the protein. Since VEGF is known to be upregulated by hypoxia, the expression pattern of VEGF would provide further clues to the oxygen status in the placentae at the time of sampling, presently a subject under great debate. The geometric mean concentration of VEGF immunoreactivity in umbilical vein serum of normal pregnant women was 112.46 pg/ml, in women with pre-eclampsia 50.23 pg/ml and in IUGR alone 175.35 pg/ml. These values were not statistically different from each other. Immunolocalization of VEGF in normal term villous placenta was observed in the syncytiotrophoblast with less intense staining in stromal cells. No qualitative differences in localization of staining between the groups (normal pregnancies, pre-eclampsia, pre-eclampsia plus IUGR, and IUGR) was found. Intensity of staining in stromal cells nias also similar in the groups studied. However, intensity of VEGF immunostaining in syncytiotrophoblast was significantly reduced in the three pathological groups (P<0.02) compared with the control group. These results suggest that reduced VEGF may be responsible, at least in part, for the impaired vascular development which occurs in these conditions.

The major. contribution is that associated with the electrostatic field produced by ejection of the Ni(2p) photoelectron, the minor contribution is the rt laxation energy associated with filling unoccupied, conduction band 3d(9) and 4s Ni metal orbitals. These conduction band orbitals become localized on the Ni photoion (and sometimes filled) in response to the field created by the photoemission event.

Although Ni is bonded to oxide in these phases, Ni2p binding energies differ substantially, and reflect primarily the nature of the ligand (O2-, OH-, SO42-) to which Ni is bonded. The influence of the ligand Is the result of charge (electron) transfer from valence band beading orbitals of dominantly ligand character, to unoccupied conduction band orbitals localized on Ni photoions.

Annual banding in corals provides vertical rates of deformation spanning the last half of the 20th century, and repeated GPS surveys between 1991 and 2001 and continuous measurements at GPS stations operated since 2002 provide horizontal velocities. Near the equator, the megathrust is locked over a narrow width of only a few tens of kilometers. In contrast, the locked fault zone is up to about 175 km wide in areas where great interplate earthquakes have occurred in the past. Formal inversion of the data reveals that these strongly coupled patches are roughly coincident with asperities that ruptured during these events. The correlation is most spectacular for rupture of the M-w 8.7 Nias-Simeulue earthquake of 2005, which released half of the moment deficit that had accumulated since its previous rupture in 1861, suggesting that this earthquake was overdue. Beneath the Mentawai islands, strong coupling is observed within the overlapping rupture areas of the great earthquakes of 1797 and 1833. The accumulated slip deficit since these events is slowly reaching the amount of slip that occurred during the 1833 earthquake but already exceeds the slip that occurred during the 1797 earthquake. Thus, rerupture of part of the Mentawai patch in September 2007 was not a surprise. In contrast, coupling is low below the Batu islands near the equator and around Enggano island at about 5 degrees S, where only moderate earthquakes (M-w < 8.0) have occurred in the past two centuries. The correlation of large seismic asperities with patches that are locked during the interseismic period suggests that they are persistent features. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the large locked patches and great ruptures occur beneath persistent geomorphologic features, the largest outer arc islands. Depth- and convergence-rate-dependent temperature might influence the pattern of coupling, through its effect on the rheology of the plate interface, but other influences are required to account for the observed along-strike heterogeneity of coupling. In particular, subduction of the Investigator Fracture Zone could be the cause for the low coupling near the equator.", "ISSN": "2169-9313", "pub": "JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH", "volume": "113", "authors": ["Chlieh, M", "Avouac, JP", "Sieh, K", "Natawidjaja, DH", "Galetzka, J"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007JB004981/abstract", "issue": "B5", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-3697(57)90028-8", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022369757900288/pdf?md5=14ec38f45f7e9a68d4260b99dba7b2de&pid=1-s2.0-0022369757900288-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1957", "title": "SOLID SOLUTIONS BETWEEN FERROMAGNETIC AND ANTIFERROMAGNETIC COMPOUNDS WITH NIAS STRUCTURE", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-3697", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS", "volume": "3", "authors": ["LOTGERING, FK", "GORTER, EW"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022369757900288", "issue": "3-4", "pages": "238-249"}, {"DOI": "10.3767/000651909X475941", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2009", "title": "Southeast Asia's changing palaeogeography", "abstract": "Geology provides the basis for understanding distributions of faunas and floras in Southeast Asia but only via a complex interplay of plate movements, palaeogeography, ocean circulation and climate. Southeast Asia grew incrementally by the addition of continental fragments, mainly rifted from Australia, and added to the margins of Sundaland as a result of subduction. Sundaland was an almost permanent land area from the beginning of the Mesozoic. The addition of the continental fragments of Southwest Borneo and later East Java-West Sulawesi formed a much larger emergent land area by the Late Cretaceous that extended from Indochina to West Sulawesi. Subduction resumed at the Sundaland margin in the Eocene and this led to widespread rifting within Sundaland, and formed one of the most important barriers at its edge, the Makassar Straits. Australia began to collide with Southeast Asia about 25 million years ago, effectively closing the former deep ocean separating the two continents, and forming the region now known as Wallacea. Collision, volcanism, and subduction-related processes have led to rise of mountains but also formed new oceans within this complex region. Plate tectonic movements and collisions were intimately linked to changing topography, bathymetry and land/sea distributions which have in turn influenced oceanic circulation and climate. As the deep-water barrier between Australia and Southeast Asia was eliminated and mountains rose, deep marine basins also formed, Eustatic changes in sea level further contributed to a complex palaeogeography. The present gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans is the only low latitude oceanic passage between the world's oceans, and is an important influence on local and probably global climate. The gateway is likely to have been just as significant in the past.

It can be interpreted as superposition of the fundamental, first, second and third overtones of spheroidal modes or Rayleigh waves and has a group velocity from 4.5 to 9 km s(-1) over a period range of 100-1000 s. The amplitude of long period waves better represents the tsunami potential of an earthquake. Because of the fast group velocity of W phase, most of W phase energy is contained within a short time window after the arrival of the P wave. At a distance of 50 degrees, W phase energy is contained within 23 min after the origin time which is the distinct advantage of using W phase for rapid tsunami warning purposes. We use a time domain deconvolution method to extract W phases from the broad-band records of global seismic networks. The bandwidth of W phase is approximately from 0.001 to 0.01 Hz, and we bandpass filter the data from 0.001 to 0.005 Hz in most cases. Having extracted W phase from the vertical component records, we perform a linear inversion using a point source to determine M(w) and the source mechanism for several large earthquakes including the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, the 2005 Nias earthquake, the 2006 Kuril Is. earthquake and the 2007 Sumatra earthquake.

Our studies have revealed a far more complex system than previously thought. This paper presents the first extensive investigation in the whole distribution area of myrmecophytic Macaranga. All ant-inhabited species were restricted to the moister parts of SE Asia: Peninsular Malaysia, South and East Thailand, Sumatra and Borneo. We found a rather strict and similar altitudinal zonation of myrmecophytic Macaranga species in all regions. Here we focus on the majority of the 19. Macaranga species obligatorily associated with ants of the genus Crematogaster. We identified a total of 2163 ant queens which belonged to at least eight (morpho)species of the small subgenus Decacrema as well as to one non-Decacrema (probably from Atopogyne). The ant species there not randomly distributed among the Macaranga species but distinct patterns of associations emerged. Despite common sympatric distribution of Macaranga species, in most cases a surprisingly high specificity of ant colonization was maintained which was, however, often not species-specific but groups of certain plant species with identical ant partners could be found. These colonization patterns usually but not always mirror existing taxonomic sections within the genus Macaranga. Possible mechanisms of specificity are discussed. The results are compared with other ant-plant mutualisms.

Surveys to major interventional centers in Europe, North and South America, and Asia were initially completed in June 1997. Subsequent information from these 24 centers in addition to 12 new centers has been obtained to update the information. The survey asked the various questions regarding the patients enrolled, procedure techniques, and results of carotid stenting, including complications and restenosis. The total number of endovascular carotid stent procedures that have been performed worldwide to date included 5,210 procedures involving 4,757 patients. There was a technical success of 98.4% with 5,129 carotid arteries treated. Complications that occurred during the carotid stent placement or within a 30-day period following placement were recorded. Overall, there were 134 transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) for a rate of 2.82%. Based on the total patient population, there were 129 minor strokes with a rate of occurrence of 2.72%. The total number of major strokes was 71 for a rate of 1.49%. There were 41 deaths within a 30-day postprocedure period resulting in a mortality rate of 0.86%. The combined minor and major strokes and procedure-related death rate was 5.07%. Restenosis rates of carotid stenting have been 1.99 % and 3.46% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The rate of neurologic events after stent placement has been 1.42% at 6-12-month follow-up. Endovascular stent treatment of carotid artery atherosclerotic disease is growing as an alternative for vascular surgery, especially for patients that are high risk for standard carotid endarterectomy. The periprocedure risks for major and minor strokes and death are generally acceptable at this early stage of development and have not changed significantly since the first survey results.

From an application of these results to US white men and women aged 35 to 64 years, it is estimated that a successful population intervention alone could reduce CHD incidence more than could medical treatment for all those with a DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher. It could prevent 84% of the number prevented by medical treatment for all those with a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher. For stroke (including TIAs), a population-wide 2-mm Hg reduction could prevent 93% of events prevented by medical treatment for those with a DBP of 95 mm Hg or higher and 69% of events for treatment for those with a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher. A combination strategy of both a population reduction in DBP and targeted medical intervention is most effective and could double or triple the impact of medical treatment alone. Adding a population-based intervention to existing levels of hypertension treatment could prevent an estimated additional 67 000 CHD events (6%) and 34 000 stroke and TIA events (13%) annually among all those aged 35 to 64 years in the United States.\n\nConclusions: A small reduction of 2 mm Hg in DBP in the mean of the population distribution, in addition to medical treatment, could have a great public health impact on the number of CHD and stroke events prevented. Whether such DBP reductions can be achieved in the population through lifestyle interventions, in particular through sodium reduction, depends on the results of ongoing primary prevention trials as well as the cooperation of the food industry, government agencies, and health education professionals.", "ISSN": "0003-9926", "pub": "ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE", "volume": "155", "authors": ["COOK, NR", "COHEN, J", "HEBERT, PR", "TAYLOR, JO", "HENNEKENS, CH"], "DOIlink": "http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx", "issue": "7", "pages": "701-709"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 30 1991", "title": "SWEDISH ASPIRIN LOW-DOSE TRIAL (SALT) OF 75 MG ASPIRIN AS SECONDARY PROPHYLAXIS AFTER CEREBROVASCULAR ISCHEMIC EVENTS", "abstract": "The efficacy of aspirin in daily doses of 300 mg and more as secondary prophylaxis after cerebrovascular events is well established.

Symptomatic carotid stenosis patients are at high risk of early recurrent stroke. In this group, asymptomatic microembolic signals (MES), detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), are markers of future stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) risk. They offer a surrogate marker to evaluate antiplatelet therapy, but no multicenter study has evaluated the feasibility of this approach.\n\nMethods and Results-Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Reduction of Emboli in Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis (CARESS) is a randomized, double-blind study in subjects with recently symptomatic &GE; 50% carotid stenosis. Patients were screened with TCD, and if MES were detected, they were randomized to clopidogrel and aspirin or aspirin monotherapy. Repeated TCD recordings were made on days 2 and 7. MES were detected in 110 of 230 patients by online analysis at baseline, of whom 107 were randomized. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant reduction in the primary end point: 43.8% of dual-therapy patients were MES positive on day 7, as compared with 72.7% of monotherapy patients ( relative risk reduction 39.8%; 95% CI, 13.8 to 58.0; P = 0.0046).

There were 43 females and 24 males with a mean age of 42 years (1970). RCVS was spontaneous in 37 of patients and secondary in the 63 others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants. The main pattern of presentation (94 of patients) was multiple thunderclap headaches recurring over a mean period of 1 week. In 51 patients (76), headaches resumed the clinical presentation. Various complications were observed, with different time courses. Cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage (cSAH) (22), intracerebral haemorrhage (6), seizures (3) and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy (9) were early complications, occurring mainly within the first week. Ischaemic events, including TIAs (16) and cerebral infarction (4), occurred significantly later than haemorrhagic events, mainly during the second week. Significant sex differences were observed: women were older, had more frequent single-drug exposure and a higher rate of stroke and cSAH. Sixty-one patients were treated by nimodipine: 36 had recurrent headaches, 7 TIAs and one multiple infarcts.

A program of critical topics was developed, and each expert presented a talk and provided the chairman with a summary statement.

Indications for carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic good-risk patients performed by a surgeon whose surgical morbidity and mortality rate is less than 3% are as follows. (1) Proven: none. As this statement went to press, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke issued a clinical advisory stating that the Institute has halted the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) because of a clear benefit in favor of surgery for patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 60% as measured by diameter reduction. When the ACAS report is published, this indication will be recategorized as proven. (2) acceptable but not proven: stenosis >75% by linear diameter; (3) uncertain: stenosis >75% in a high-risk patient/surgeon (surgical morbidity and mortality rate >3%), combined carotid/coronary operations, or ulcerative lesions without hemodynamically significant stenosis; (4) proven inappropriate: operations with a combined stroke morbidity and mortality >5%.", "ISSN": "0009-7322", "pub": "CIRCULATION", "volume": "91", "authors": ["MOORE, WS", "BARNETT, HJM", "BEEBE, HG", "BERNSTEIN, EF", "BRENER, BJ", "BROTT, T", "CAPLAN, LR", "DAY, A", "GOLDSTONE, J", "HOBSON, RW", "KEMPCZINSKI, RF", "MATCHAR, DB", "MAYBERG, MR", "NICOLAIDES, AN", "NORRIS, JW", "RICOTTA, JJ", "ROBERTSON, JT", "RUTHERFORD, RB", "THOMAS, D", "TOOLE, JF", "TROUT, HH", "WIEBERS, DO"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "2", "pages": "566-579"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 2004", "title": "Long-term outcome in children with moyamoya syndrome after cranial revascularization by pial synangiosis", "abstract": "Object. Moyamoya syndrome, a narrowing of the basal intracranial vessels accompanied by the development of a cloud of collateral \"moyamoya\" vasculature, causes cerebral ischemia and stroke. This study was undertaken to determine if a standardized neurosurgical revascularization procedure, pial synangiosis, conferred long-term benefit in pediatric:1 patients.\n\nMethods. The authors reviewed the clinical and radiographic records obtained in a consecutive series of patients with moyamoya syndrome. Patients were 21 years of age or younger and underwent surgery performed by a single neurosurgeon during a 17-year period.\n\nThere were 143 patients (89 females and 54 males). Sixteen patients were Asian. Neurofibromatosis was present in 16 patients, 13 had undergone therapeutic cranial irradiation, and Down syndrome was present in 10. In 66 there was no known predisposing condition. Stroke had occurred in 67.8% of the population and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in 43.4% prior to surgery. Within the first 30 days following 271 craniotomies for pial synangiosis, there were 11 episodes of stroke (7.7% per patient; 4% per surgically treated hemisphere) and three severe TIAs.\n\nFollow-up evaluation was performed in all but one patient (mean period 5.1 years). In 126 patients followed for more than 1 year, four suffered a late-onset stroke, one suffered a severe reversible TIA without magnetic resonance imaging-documented evidence of stroke, and two experienced persistent TIAs. In 46 patients followed for more than 5 years in whom the major initial presentation was stroke alone, only two late-onset strokes have occurred. Functional status at the time of surgery determined long-term functional status.\n\nConclusions.

We present the incidence and short-term prognosis of TIA within a large population with a significant proportion of minorities with out-of-hospital TIA.\n\nMethods-TIA cases were identified between July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994 from the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky population of 1.3 million inhabitants by previously published surveillance methods, including inpatient and out-of-hospital events. Incidence rates were adjusted to the 1990 population, and life-table analyses were used for prognosis.\n\nResults-The overall race, age, and gender-adjusted incidence rate for TIA within our population was 83 per 100 000, with age, race, and gender adjusted to the 1990 US population. Blacks and men had significantly higher rates of TIA than whites and women. Risk of stroke after TIA was 14.6% at 3 months, and risk of TIA/stroke/death was 25.2%. Age, race, and sex were not associated with recurrent TIA or subsequent stroke in our population, but age was associated with mortality.\n\nConclusions-Using our incidence rates for TIA in blacks and whites, we conservatively estimate that approximate to 240 000 TIAs occurred in 2002 in the United States. Our incidence rate of TIA is slightly higher than previously reported, which may be related to the inclusion of blacks and out-of-hospital events. There are racial and gender-related differences in the incidence of TIA.

This risk might have fallen in recent years owing to improvements in medical treatment, but there are no published prognostic data from studies initiated within the last 10 years.\n\nMethods-In a population-based study of all patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke in the Oxford Vascular Study, we studied the risk of TIA and stroke in patients with >= 50% contralateral asymptomatic carotid stenoses recruited consecutively from 2002 to 2009 and given intensive contemporary medical treatment.\n\nResults-Of 1153 consecutively imaged patients presenting with stroke or TIA, 101 (8.8%) had >= 50% asymptomatic carotid stenoses (mean age, 75 years; 39% women; 40% age >= 80 years). During 301 patient-years of follow-up (mean, 3 years), there were 6 ischemic events in the territory of an asymptomatic stenosis, 1 minor stroke (initially 50% to 69% stenosis), and 5 TIAs (2 initially 50% to 69% stenosis; 3 to 70% to 99% stenosis), 3 of which led to subsequent endarterectomy. The average annual event rates on medical treatment were 0.34% (95% CI, 0.01 to 1.87) for any ipsilateral ischemic stroke, 0% (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.99) for disabling ipsilateral stroke, and 1.78% (95% CI, 0.58 to 4.16) for ipsilateral TIA.\n\nConclusions-In the first study of the prognosis of >= 50% asymptomatic carotid stenosis to be initiated in the last 10 years, the risk of stroke on intensive contemporary medical treatment was low.

They arise in association with platelet activation and other unknown causes.  Elevated PMPs have been observed in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a disorder in which autoantibody interacts with platelets and the opsonized platelets are destroyed by macrophages.  However, the clinical significance of PMP has been unknown.  Using flow cytometry, we examined PMP concentrations in 62 patients with ITP and in 33 normal control subjects to assess the clinical significance of PMP in ITP.  When compared with PMP levels in control subjects, PMP levels were significantly higher (p < 0.005) in patients with ITP, but considerable variation among individual patients was observed.  Patients with platelet counts less-than-or-equal-to 60,000 were evaluated for correlation of PMP levels with manifestations of thrombocytopenias; patients without symptoms (free of petechiae or mucosal bleeding) are found to have significantly higher PMP levels (p < 0.05) than patients with symptoms, suggesting hemostatic protection by PMP.  Additionally, we identified a group of patients with ITP who experienced neurologic complications resembling transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIAs):  recurrent episodes of dizzy spells or weakness in mild cases, and coma, seizure, or progressive dementia in advanced cases.  Small cerebral infarcts were demonstrated by computed axial tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging in spite of severe thrombocytopenias.  Patients with this syndrome are often found to have higher PMP levels (p < 0.005) when compared with the group free of neurologic complications.  It is concluded that PMPs play an important role in hemostasis in patients with thrombocytopenia, and that high concentrations of hemostatically active PMP can be thrombogenic in certain clinical settings.

Our objectives were 3-fold: to document the use of warfarin and aspirin therapy in Missouri Medicare beneficiaries with chronic NVAF; to identify factors associated with warfarin and aspirin underuse; and to determine the association between prescription of warfarin and aspirin at hospital discharge and adverse outcomes in this elderly, frail population.\n\nMethods-We linked chart reviews from all Missouri hospitals to Medicare claims data from 1993 to 1996. From chart reviews, we documented Medicare beneficiaries' demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and antithrombotic therapy prescribed at the time of hospital discharge. From Medicare claims, we determined the date of outcomes-death from any cause or hospitalization for an ischemic event (a stroke, a TIA, or a myocardial infarction),\n\nResults-Only 328 (55%) of the 597 Medicare beneficiaries were prescribed antithrombotic therapy at hospital discharge: 34% received warfarin and 21% received aspirin. Advanced age, female gender, and rural residency predicted underuse of antithrombotic therapy. After controlling for these factors, as well as stroke risk factors and contraindications to anticoagulation, the prescription of warfarin was associated with a 24% relative risk reduction (RRR) in adverse outcomes (P=0.003).

Background: Ischemic tolerance or preconditioning, which protects the brain against stroke, has been demonstrated in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Because TIA may represent a clinical model of ischemic tolerance, patients with TIA before cerebral infarction (CI) may therefore have a better outcome than patients without TIA before CI. Methods: A total of 2,490 patients admitted consecutively to a primary care center for first-ever CI in the anterior circulation were divided into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of prior ipsilateral TIAs. Duration of TIA was classified into three groups (<10 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes, and >20 minutes). The severity of the neurologic picture on admission and functional disability after stroke were compared between patients with and without TIAs. Results: A total of 293 (12%) of the 2,490 patients had prior ipsilateral TIAs before CI. Risk factors did not differ between patients with or without TIAs, whereas the topography and etiology of ischemic stroke did differ (p < 0.001). Patients without prior TIAs had a more severe clinical picture on admission, with a greater reduction of consciousness (p = 0.009). Patients with previous TIAs had a more favorable outcome than those without TIAs (67% versus 58%, p = 0.004).

To effect solution, those subgroups of patients at greatest risk must be identified, thereby allowing efficient implementation of new clinical strategies. No such subgroup has been identified; however, patients undergoing intracardiac surgery are thought to be at high risk, but comprehensive data regarding specific risk, impact on cost, and discharge disposition are not available.\n\nMethods-We prospectively studied 273 patients enrolled from 24 diverse US medical centers, who were undergoing intracardiac and coronary artery surgery. Patient data were collected using standardized methods and included clinical, historical, specialized testing, neurological outcome and autopsy data, and measures of resource utilization. Adverse outcomes were defined a priori and determined after database closure by a blinded independent panel. Stepwise logistic regression models were developed to estimate the relative risks associated with clinical history and intraoperative and postoperative events.\n\nResults-Adverse cerebral outcomes occurred in 16% of patients (43/273), being nearly equally divided between type I outcomes (8.4%; 5 cerebral deaths, 16 nonfatal strokes, and 2 new TIAs) and type II outcomes (7.3%; 17 new intellectual deterioration persisting at hospital discharge and 3 newly diagnosed seizures). Associated resource utilization was significantly increased-prolonging median intensive care unit stay from 3 days (no adverse cerebral outcome) to 8 days (type I; P<0.001) and from 3 to 6 days (type II; P<0.001), and increasing hospitalization by 50% (type II, P=0.04) to 100% (type I, P<0.001). Furthermore, specialized care after hospital discharge was frequently necessary in those with type I outcomes, in that only 31% returned home compared with 85% of patients without cerebral complications (P<0.001). Significant risk factors for type I outcomes related primarily to embolic phenomena, including proximal aortic atherosclerosis, intracardiac thrombus, and intermittent clamping of the aorta during surgery. For type II outcomes, risk factors again included proximal aortic atherosclerosis, as well as a preoperative history of endocarditis, alcohol abuse, perioperative dysrhythmia or poorly controlled hypertension, and the development of a low-output state after cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nConclusions-These prospective multicenter findings demonstrate that patients undergoing intracardiac surgery combined with coronary revascularization are at formidable risk, in that 1 in 6 will develop cerebral complications that are frequently costly and devastating. Thus, new strategies for perioperative management-including technical and pharmacological interventions-are now mandated for this subgroup of cardiac surgery patients.", "ISSN": "0039-2499", "pub": "STROKE", "volume": "30", "authors": ["Wolman, RL", "Nussmeier, NA", "Aggarwal, A", "Kanchuger, MS", "Roach, GW", "Newman, MF", "Mangano, CM", "Marschall, KE", "Ley, C", "Boisvert, DM", "Ozanne, GM", "Herskowitz, A", "Graham, SH", "Mangano, DT"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "514-522"}, {"DOI": "10.1503/cmaj.1030460", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 30 2004", "title": "Early risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack in patients with internal carotid artery disease", "abstract": "Background: Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) often herald a stroke, but little is known about the acute natural history of TIAs. Our objective was to quantify the early risk of stroke after a TIA in patients with internal carotid artery disease.\n\nMethods: Using patient data from the medical arm of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, we calculated the risk of ipsilateral stroke in the territory of the symptomatic internal carotid artery within 2 and 90 days after a first-recorded hemispheric TIA. We also studied similar outcomes among patients in the trial who had a first-recorded completed hemispheric stroke.\n\nResults: For patients with a first-recorded hemispheric TIA (n = 603), the 90-day risk of ipsilateral stroke was 20.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.0%-23.2%), higher than the 2.3% risk (95% CI 1.0%-3.6%) for patients with a hemispheric stroke (n = 526). The 2-day risks were 5.5% and 0.0%, respectively. Patients with more severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery (> 70%) appeared to be at no greater risk of stroke than patients with lesser degrees of stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.7). Infarct on brain imaging (adjusted hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0) and the presence of intracranial major-artery disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7) doubled the early risk of stroke in patients with a hemispheric TIA.\n\nInterpretation: Patients who had a hemispheric TIA related to internal carotid artery disease had a high risk of stroke in the first few days after the TIA.

While contrast transthoracic echocardiography has been used to detect PFO, contrast transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has a greater sensitivity. Prior studies reported the incidence of PFO in patients presenting with a CVA or TIA.\n\nDesign: To determine the incidence of PFO in a more general population, we reviewed 1,000 consecutive TEEs performed with contrast and color Doppler for the presence of PFO and other cardioembolic risk factors, including atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), aortic plaque, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and atrial thrombi. While imaging with monoplane or biplane TEE, multiple injections of agitated saline solution were injected during cough or Valsalva maneuver to detect now through a PFO.\n\nPatients: There were 482 male and 518 female patients with mean age of 60 +/- 17 years (range 11 to 93 years). Results: Patent foramen ovale was found in 9.2% of all patients and, though seen in all age groups divided by decade, the incidence in patients aged 40 to 49 years was greater than those aged 70 to 79 years (12.96% vs 6.15%, p=0.03). Contrast TEE had a much higher detection rate than color Doppler alone. Importantly, there was no greater incidence of PFO in patients with CVA vs those without CVA, or in male vs female patients. Also, there was a very strong correlation between the presence of ASA and PFO (p<.001).\n\nConclusion: Thus, PFO detected by TEE, frequently seen with ASA, is seen in all age groups and does not in itself present a risk factor for CVA.

Ximelagatran is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics and no known food or pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\n\nMETHODS This was a 12-week, randomized, parallel-group, dose-guiding study of NVAF patients with at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary end point was the number of thromboembolic events and bleedings. Three groups received ximelagatran (n = 187) at 20, 40, or 60 mg twice daily, given in a double-blind fashion, without routine coagulation monitoring. In a fourth group, warfarin (n, = 67) was managed and monitored according to normal routines, aiming for an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.\n\nRESULTS A total of 254 patients received study drug. One ischemic stroke (nonfatal) and one transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in the ximelagatran group. Two TIAs occurred in the warfarin group. No major bleeds were observed in the ximelagatran group. One major bleed occurred in a warfarin-treated patient. The number of minor and multiple minor bleeds was low, but there was a slight increase by ximelagatran dose. The 60-mg dose resulted in the same number of bleeding events as that with warfarin. S-alanine aminotransferase was increased in eight patients (4.3%) taking ximelagatran, but normalized with continuous treatment or cessation of the drug.\n\nCONCLUSIONS Fixed oral doses of ximelagatran up to 60 mg twice daily were well tolerated, without the need for dose adjustment or coagulation monitoring.

The cultures established after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation showed wide phenotypic diversity, reflecting the complexity of the biosynthetic pathway. Cultures transgenic for Str consistently showed tenfold higher STR activity than wild-type cultures, which favored biosynthetic activity through the pathway. Two such lines accumulated over 200 mg.L-1 of the glucoalkaloid strictosidine and/or strictosidine-derived TIAs, including ajmalicine, catharanthine, serpentine, and tabersonine, while maintaining wild-type levels of TDC activity. Alkaloid accumulation by highly productive transgenic lines showed considerable instability and was strongly influenced by culture conditions, such as the hormonal composition of the medium and the availability of precursors. High transgene-encoded TDC activity was not only unnecessary for increased productivity, but also detrimental to the normal growth of the cultures. In contrast, high STR activity was tolerated by the cultures and appeared to be necessary, albeit not sufficient, to sustain high rates of alkaloid biosynthesis.

Results of studies of its effectiveness in prevention of HIV-1 infection in women have been inconclusive. We aimed to assess effectiveness of this vaginal gel.\n\nMethods We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded, phase 2/3 trial with COL-1492, a nonoxynol-9 vaginal gel, in 892 female sex workers in four countries: Benin, Cote d'lvoire, South Africa, and Thailand. 449 women were randomly allocated nonoxynol-9 and 443 placebo. Primary endpoint was incident HIV-1 infection. Secondary endpoints included Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Analysis was by intention to treat.\n\nFindings 765 women were included in the primary analysis. HIV-1 frequency in nonoxynol-9 users was 59 (16%) of 376 compared with 104 (27%) of 389 in placebo users (402.5 vs 435.0 woman-years; hazard ratio adjusted for centre 1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.2; p=0.047). 239 (32%) women reported use of a mean of more than 3.5 applicators per working day, and in these women, risk of HIV-1 infection in nonoxynol-9 users was almost twice that in placebo users (hazard ratio 1.8; 95% CI 1.0-3.2). 516 (68%) women used the gel less frequently tan 3.5 times a day, and in these, risk did not differ between he two treatments. No significant effect of nonoxynol-9 on N gonorrhoeae (1.2; 0.9-1.6) or C trachomatis (1.2; 0.8-1.6) infections was reported.\n\nInterpretation This study did not show a protective effect of COL-1492 on HIV-1 transmission in high-risk women.

Such data help to determine the management of HIV-positive people. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections are prevalent in Cote d'Ivoire, and the pathology of HIV-2 infection in Africa is unclear.\n\nMethods: Consecutive adult medical admissions to a large city hospital in Cote d'Ivoire were studied in 1991, and a sample of HIV-positive deaths autopsied.\n\nResults: Of 5401 patients evaluated, 50% were HIV-positive; 38% of these died, with a median survival of 1 week. At autopsy (n=294, including 24% of HIV-positive deaths in hospital), tuberculosis (TB), bacteraemia (predominantly Gram-negative rods) and cerebral toxoplasmosis caused 53% of deaths. TB was seen in 54% of cadavers with AIDS-defining pathology and Pneumocystis pneumonia in 4%. The median CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in those who died was <90x10(6)/l. Compared with HIV-1-positives, patients with HIV-2-positivity had a greater frequency of severe cytomegalovirus infection, HIV encephalitis and cholangitis.\n\nConclusions: In this population, HIV-positive adults present to hospital with advanced disease associated with high mortality. The three major underlying pathologies (TB, toxoplasmosis and bacteraemia) are either preventable or treatable. TB is an underestimated cause of the 'slim' syndrome in Africa.

As pyrethroid resistance has been reported in this mosquito, reliable and simple techniques are urgently needed to characterize and monitor this resistance in the field, In insects, an important mechanism of pyrethroid resistance is due to a modification of the voltage-gated sodium channel protein recently shown to be associated with mutations of the para-type sodium channel gene. We demonstrate here that one of these mutations is present in certain strains of pyrethroid resistant A. gambiae s.s. and describe a PCR-based diagnostic test allowing its detection in the genome of single mosquitoes, Using this test, we found this mutation in six out of seven field samples from West Africa, its frequency being closely correlated with survival to pyrethroid exposure.

We assessed the acceptability, tolerance, and 6-month efficacy of a short regimen of oral zidovudine in African populations practising breastfeeding.\n\nMethods A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was carried out in public clinics of Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older, who had confirmed HIV-1 infection and pregnancy of 36-38 weeks duration, and who gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were severe anaemia, neutropenia, abnormal liver function, and sickle-cell disease. Women were randomly assigned zidovudine (n=214; 300 mg twice daily until labour, 600 mg at beginning of labour, and 300 mg twice daily for 7 days post partum) or matching placebo (n=217).

As access to antiretroviral treatment has expanded within the region; early pessimism concerning the delivery of antiretroviral treatment using a large-scale public health approach has, at least in the short term, proved to be broadly unfounded. Immunological and virological responses to ART are similar to responses in patients treated in high-income countries. Despite this, however, early mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are very high; between 8 and 26% of patients die in the first year of antiretroviral treatment, with most deaths occurring in the first few months. Patients typically access antiretroviral treatment with advanced symptomatic disease, and mortality is strongly associated with baseline CD4 cell count less than 50 cells/mu l and WHO stage 4 disease (AIDS). Although data are limited, leading causes of death appear to be tuberculosis, acute sepsis, cryptococcal meningitis, malignancy and wasting syndrome. Mortality rates are likely to depend not only on the care delivered by antiretroviral treatment programmes, but more fundamentally on how advanced disease is at programme enrolment and the quality of preceding healthcare. In addition to improving delivery of antiretroviral treatment and providing it free of charge to the patient, strategies to reduce mortality must include earlier diagnosis of HIV infection, strengthening of longitudinal HIV care and timely initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Health systems delays in antiretroviral treatment initiation must be minimized, especially in patients who present with advanced immunodeficiency.

Safety and efficacy data are now presented for all babies followed up to 18 months of age.\n\nMethods From November, 1997, to April, 1999, HIV-1 infected pregnant women in Kampala, Uganda, were randomly assigned nevirapine (200 mg at labour onset and 2 mg/kg for babies within 72 h of birth; regimen A) or zidovudine (600 mg orally at labour onset and 300 mg every 3 h until delivery, and 4 mg/kg orally twice daily for babies for 7 days, regimen B). Infant HIV-1 testing was done at birth, age 6-8 and 14-16 weeks, and age 12 months by HIV-1 RNA PCR, and by HIV-1 antibody at 18 months. HIV-1 transmission and HIV-1-free survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We recorded adverse experiences through 6-8 weeks postpartum for mothers, and 18 months for babies. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat.\n\nFindings We enrolled 645 mothers to the study: 313 were assigned regimen A, 313 regimen B, and 19 placebo. Eight mothers were lost to follow-up before delivery. 99% of babies were breastfed (median duration 9 months). Estimated risks of HIV-1 transmission in the zidovudine and nevirapine groups were 10.3% and 8.1% at birth (p=0.35); 20.0% and 11.8% by age 6-8 weeks (p=0.0063); 22.1% and 13.5% by age 14-16 weeks (p=0.0064); and 25.8% and 15.7% by age 18 months (p=0.0023).

To control malaria vectors in KZN, houses were sprayed annually with residual DDT 2 g/m(2) until 1996 when the treatment changed to deltamethrin 20-25 mg/m(2). At Ndumu (27 degrees 02' S, 32 degrees 19' E) the recorded malaria incidence increased more than six-fold between 1995 and 1999. Entomological surveys during late 1999 found mosquitoes of the Anopheles funestus group (Diptera: Culicidae) resting in sprayed houses in some sectors of Ndumu area. This very endophilic vector of malaria had been eliminated from South Africa by DDT spraying in the 1950s, leaving the less endophilic An. arabiensis Patton as the only vector of known importance in KZN. Deltamethrin-sprayed houses at Ndumu were checked for insecticide efficacy by bioassay using susceptible An. arabiensis (laboratory-reared) that demonstrated 100% mortality. Members of the An. funestus group from Ndumu houses (29 males, 116 females) were identified by the rDNA PCR method and four species were found: 74 An. funestus Giles sensu stricto, 34 An. parensis Gillies, seven An. rivulorum Leeson and one An. leesoni Evans. Among An. funestus s.s. females, 5.4% (4/74) were positive for Plasmodium falciparum by ELISA and PCR tests. To test for pyrethroid resistance, mosquito adults were exposed to permethrin discriminating dosage and mortality scored 24 h post-exposure: survival rates of wild-caught healthy males were 5/10 An. funestus, 1/9 An. rivulorum and 0/2 An. parensis; survival rates of laboratory-reared adult progeny from 19 An. funestus females averaged 14% (after 1 h exposure to 1% permethrin 25 : 75 cis : trans on papers in WHO test kits) and 27% (after 30 min in a bottle with 25 mu g permethrin 40 : 60 cis : trans). Anopheles funestus families showing > 20% survival in these two resistance test procedures numbered 5/19 and 12/19, respectively. Progeny from 15 of the families were tested on 4% DDT impregnated papers and gave 100% mortality.

It is exactly 40 y since the last global map of malaria endemicity was published. This paper describes the generation of a new world map of Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity for the year 2007.\n\nMethods and Findings\n\nA total of 8,938 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were identified using a variety of exhaustive search strategies. Of these, 7,953 passed strict data fidelity tests for inclusion into a global database of PfPR data, age-standardized to 2-10 y for endemicity mapping. A model-based geostatistical procedure was used to create a continuous surface of malaria endemicity within previously defined stable spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission. These procedures were implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework so that the uncertainty of these predictions could be evaluated robustly. The uncertainty was expressed as the probability of predicting correctly one of three endemicity classes; previously stratified to be an informative guide for malaria control. Population at risk estimates, adjusted for the transmission modifying effects of urbanization in Africa, were then derived with reference to human population surfaces in 2007. Of the 1.38 billion people at risk of stable P. falciparum malaria, 0.69 billion were found in Central and South East Asia (CSE Asia), 0.66 billion in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia (Africa+), and 0.04 billion in the Americas. All those exposed to stable risk in the Americas were in the lowest endemicity class (PfPR(2-10) <= 5%). The vast majority (88%) of those living under stable risk in CSE Asia were also in this low endemicity class; a small remainder (11%) were in the intermediate endemicity class ( PfPR(2-10) > 5 to < 40%); and the remaining fraction (1%) in high endemicity (PfPR(2-10) >= 40%) areas. High endemicity was widespread in the Africa+ region, where 0.35 billion people are at this level of risk. Most of the rest live at intermediate risk (0.20 billion), with a smaller number (0.11 billion) at low stable risk.\n\nConclusions\n\nHigh levels of P. falciparum malaria endemicity are common in Africa. Uniformly low endemic levels are found in the Americas. Low endemicity is also widespread in CSE Asia, but pockets of intermediate and very rarely high transmission remain. There are therefore significant opportunities for malaria control in Africa and for malaria elimination elsewhere.

We did a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at community-health centres in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, to assess the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) chemoprophylaxis at early stages of HIV-1 infection.\n\nMethod 843 HIV-infected patients were screened and 545 enrolled in the study. Eligible adults (with HIV-1 or HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual seropositivity at stages 2 or 3 of the WHO staging system) received co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis (trimethoprim 160 mg, sulphamethoxazole 800 mg) daily or a matching placebo.

We analyzed individual patient data to determine the contribution of late postnatal transmission to the overall risk of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the timing and determinants of late postnatal transmission.\n\nMethods. Eligible trials were conducted where breast-feeding was common; included greater than or equal to2 HIV-1 tests by 3 months, and, if follow-up continued, greater than or equal to2 tests at 3-12 months; and regularly assessed infant-feeding modality. Data on children born before January 2000 were analyzed.\n\nResults. Of 4085 children from 9 trials (breast-fed singletons for whom HIV-1 testing was performed), 993 (24%) were definitively infected (placebo arms, 25.9%; treatment arms, 23.4%; P = .08 ). Of 539 children with known timing of infection, 225 (42%) had late postnatal transmission. Late postnatal transmission occurred throughout breast-feeding. The estimated hazard function for time to late postnatal transmission was roughly constant. The cumulative probability of late postnatal transmission at 18 months was 9.3%. The overall risk of late postnatal transmission was 8.9 transmissions/100 child-years of breast-feeding and was significantly higher with lower maternal CD4(+) cell counts and male sex.\n\nConclusions. Late postnatal transmission contributes substantially to overall mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The risk of late postnatal transmission is generally constant throughout breast-feeding, and late postnatal transmission is associated with a lower maternal CD4(+) cell count and male sex. Biological and cultural mechanisms underlying the association between sex and late postnatal transmission should be further investigated.

In Botswana between March 27, 2001, and October 29, 2003, 1200 HIV-positive pregnant women were randomized from 4 district hospitals. Infants were evaluated at birth, monthly until age 7 months, at age 9 months, then every third month through age 18 months.\n\nIntervention All of the mothers received zidovudine 300 mg orally twice daily from 34 weeks' gestation and during labor. Mothers and infants were randomized to receive single-dose nevirapine or placebo. Infants were randomized to 6 months of breastfeeding plus prophylactic infant zidovudine (breastfed plus zidovudine), or formula feeding plus 1 month of infant zidovudine ( formula fed).\n\nMain Outcome Measures Primary efficacy ( HIV infection by age 7 months and HIV-free survival by age 18 months) and safety ( occurrence of infant adverse events by 7 months of age) end points were evaluated in 1179 infants.\n\nResults The 7-month HIV infection rates were 5.6% ( 32 infants in the formula-fed group) vs 9.0% ( 51 infants in the breastfed plus zidovudine group) (P=. 04; 95% confidence interval for difference, - 6.4% to - 0.4%). Cumulative mortality or HIV infection rates at 18 months were 80 infants ( 13.9%, formula fed) vs 86 infants (15.1% breastfed plus zidovudine) ( P=. 60; 95% confidence interval for difference, - 5.3% to 2.9%).

Prevalence is strongly dependent on control measures, which are often neglected during periods of political instability, thus leading to resurgence. With fewer than 12000 cases of this disabling and fatal disease reported per year, trypanosomiasis belongs to the most neglected tropical diseases. The clinical presentation is complex, and diagnosis and treatment difficult. The available drugs are old, complicated to administer, and can cause severe adverse reactions.

Ten U.S. Olympic champions (winners of 32 Olympic medals) were inter-viewed, as were one of their coaches (n = 10), and a parent, guardian, or significant other (n = 10). A battery of psychological inventories was also administered to the athletes. It was found that the athletes were characterized by: (a) the ability to cope with and control anxiety; (b) confidence; (c) mental toughness/resiliency; (d) sport intelligence; (e) the ability to focus and block out distractions; (f) competitiveness;, (g) a hard-work ethic; (h) the ability to set and achieve goals; (i) coachability; (j) high levels of dispositional hope; (k) optimism; and (1) adaptive perfectionism. Results also revealed that a number of individuals and institutions influenced the athletes' psychological development including the community, family, the individual himself or herself, non-sport personnel, sport environment personnel, and the sport process. Coach and family influences were particularly important. Ways in which these sources influenced the athletes were both direct, like teaching or emphasizing certain psychological lessons, and indirect, involving modeling or unintentionally creating certain psychological environments. Psychological characteristic findings verified current sport psychological research on psychological characteristics associated with peak performance (Williams & Krane, 2001). They also suggest that adaptive perfectionism, dispositional hope, and high levels of optimism are new variables to consider.

Comparative assessment of common catchment model structures on 429 catchments", "abstract": "Hydrological models must be reliable and robust as these qualities influence all applications based on model output. Previous studies on conceptual rainfall-runoff models have shown that one of the root causes of their output uncertainty is model over-parameterisation. The problem of poorly defined parameters has attracted much attention but has not yet been satisfactorily solved. We believe that the most fruitful way forward is to improve the structures where these parameters act. The main objective of this paper is to examine the role of complexity in hydrological models by studying the relation between the number of optimised parameters and model performance. An extensive comparative performance assessment of the structures of 19 daily lumped models was carried out on 429 catchments, mostly in France but also in the United States, Australia, the Ivory Coast and Brazil. Bulk treatment of the data showed that the complex models outperform the simple ones in calibration mode but not in verification mode. We argue that the main reason why complex models lack stability is that the structure, i.e. the way components are organised, is not suited to extracting information available in hydrological time-series. An inadequate complexity typically results in model over-parameterisation and parameter uncertainty. Although complexity has been used as a response to the challenge of predicting the hydrological effects of environmental changes, this study suggests that such models may have been developed with excessive confidence and that they could face difficulties of parameter estimation and structure validation when confronted with hydro-meteorological time-series. This comparative study indicates that some parsimonious models can yield promising results and should be further developed, although they are not able to tackle all types of problems, which would be the case if their complexity were ideally adapted.

Male diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana, in the Tdi forest of Gate d'Ivoire often utter long-distance calls, either spontaneously or in reaction to a variety of stimuli, including predators and non-predators. The present study focuses only on predation contexts and provides evidence for communication to both predators and conspecifics. Males called only in response to predators whose hunting success depends on unprepared prey, that is, leopards and crowned hawk eagles, but not in response to pursuit hunters, such as chimpanzees and humans, which can pursue the caller in the canopy. Calling was regularly combined with approaching the predator. Both observations suggest that male long-distance calls are used to signal detection to the predator ('perception advertisement hypothesis'). Analysis of male long-distance calls given to leopards and eagles showed that they differed according to a number of acoustic parameters. The two call variants were played to different diana monkey groups; conspecifics responded to them as though the original predator were present. We conclude that, in addition to their function in perception advertisement, diana monkey long-distance calls function as within-group semantic signals that denote different types of predators.

Using a computer-based simulation model that incorporates the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level as predictors of disease progression, we compared the long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with no treatment, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis alone, antiretroviral therapy alone, and prophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nUndiscounted gains in life expectancy ranged from 10.7 months with antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis initiated on the basis of clinical criteria to 45.9 months with antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis initiated on the basis of CD4 testing and clinical criteria, as compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis alone. The incremental cost per year of life gained was $240 (in 2002 U.S. dollars) for prophylaxis alone, $620 for antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis without CD4 testing, and $1,180 for antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis with CD4 testing, each compared with the next least expensive strategy. None of the strategies that used antiretroviral therapy alone were as cost-effective as those that also used trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. Life expectancy was increased by 30% with use of a second line of antiretroviral therapy after failure of the first-line regimen.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nA strategy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, with the use of clinical criteria alone or in combination with CD4 testing to guide the timing of treatment, is an economically attractive health investment in settings with limited resources.", "ISSN": "0028-4793", "pub": "NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE", "volume": "355", "authors": ["Goldie, SJ", "Yazdanpanah, Y", "Losina, E", "Weinstein, MC", "Anglaret, X", "Walensky, RP", "Hsu, HE", "Kimmel, A", "Holmes, C", "Kaplan, JE", "Freedberg, KA"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa060247", "issue": "11", "pages": "1141-1153"}, {"DOI": "10.1086/315836", "pdflink": "http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 2000", "title": "Interactions between herpes simplex virus type 2 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in African women: Opportunities for intervention", "abstract": "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are cofactors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, but the specific role of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is unclear.

Besides its economic impact on crop yield, it represents a major health problem because of its strongly allergenic pollen. Ragweed was imported inadvertently to Europe in the 18th century and has become invasive in several countries, notably in the Rhone Valley of France. It has recently expanded in both the Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur and Bourgogne regions. As first steps towards understanding the causes and mechanisms of ragweed invasion, genetic variability of French and North American populations was analysed using microsatellites. Overall genetic variability was similar in North America and in the Rhone-Alpes region, but within-population levels of genetic variability were surprisingly lower in native than in invasive French populations. French populations also exhibited lower among-population differentiation. A significant pattern of isolation by distance was detected among North American populations but not among French populations. Assignment tests and distribution of rare alleles did not point to a single origin for all French populations, nor for all individuals within populations and private alleles from different North American populations were found in the same French populations. Indeed, within all French populations, individual plants were roughly equally assigned to the different North American populations. Altogether, these results suggest that the French invasive populations include plants from a mixture of sources. Reduced diversity in populations distant from the original area of introduction indicated that ragweed range expansion probably occurred through sequential bottlenecks from the original populations, and not from subsequent new introductions.", "ISSN": "0962-1083", "pub": "MOLECULAR ECOLOGY", "volume": "14", "authors": ["Genton, BJ", "Shykoff, JA", "Giraud, T"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02750.x/abstract;jsessionid=8B0126A0691C647E104E43F7E6A3938C.f02t01", "issue": "14", "pages": "4275-4285"}]], [{"formation_energy_per_atom": -0.4986555870312497, "band_gap": 0.0, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

The optimization of the Li-ion technology urgently needs improvement for the active material of the negative electrode, and many recent papers in the field support this tendency. Moreover, the diversity in the chemical nature of the materials studied so far requires a systematization work to be done to envisage the main guidelines for research and future progress areas. This review starts with an analysis of the major advantages and drawbacks of the lithium metal electrode that led to the development of the Li-ion concept. The successful carbon-based materials, including numerous forms of both natural and anthropogenic origins are then mentioned. Attention is paid to the materials prepared from side products of the petroleum industry. Then, the central part of the report concerns alternative possibilities that have emerged from the use of tin, antimony and other elements that reversibly form alloys and compounds with lithium. The systematic study takes into account the chemical nature of the elements directly involved in the reversible reactions with lithium. Thus, tin and other group 14 elements, pnictides, and oxides are summarized in three consecutive sections. In the first section, particular attention will be paid to tin oxides and phosphates and the \"SnSb\" compounds serves as a link with the next section. Among the metal pnictides, compounds such as CoSb(3) and CrSb(2), are described as precursors of the electroactive material in a dispersing matrix. Also phosphides, such as CoP(3) and MnP(4), are also discussed, the latter having interesting intercalation reactions with lithium. Finally, the recently revised field of using transition metal oxides that allow a reversible Li(2)O formation on cycling is discussed. In each section, several materials evaluated in our laboratory are included. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We apply all-electron and pseudopotential ab initio methods to investigate the electronic and structural properties of ZB Mn and Cr pnictides and carbides, and find six compounds to be half metallic at or near their respective equilibrium lattice constants, making them excellent candidates for growth at low strain. Based on these findings, we further propose substrates on which the growth may be accomplished with minimum strain. Our findings are supported by the recent successful synthesis of ZB CrAs on GaAs and ZB CrSb on GaSb, where our predicted equilibrium lattice constants are within 0.5% of the lattice constants of the substrates on which the growth was accomplished. We confirm previous theoretical results for ZB MnAs, but find ZB MnSb to be half metallic at its equilibrium lattice constant, whereas previous work has found it to be only nearly so. We report here two low-strain half metallic ZB compounds, CrP and MnC, and suggest appropriate substrates for each. Unlike the other five compounds, we predict ZB MnC to become/remain half metallic with compression rather than expansion, and to exhibit metallicity in the minority- rather than majority-spin channel. These fundamentally different properties of MnC can be connected to substantially greater p-d hybridization and d-d overlap, and correspondingly larger bonding-antibonding splitting and smaller exchange splitting.

Ferromagnetic materials with half metallic properties are valuable in this respect. Here we present the electronic structure and magnetic properties of binary compounds consisting of 3d transition metals and group V elements, viz., P, Sb, and As in the zinc-blende structure. We demonstrate that compounds of V, Cr, and Mn show half metallic behavior for appropriate lattice constants. By comparing the total energies in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures, we have ascertained that the ferromagnetic phase is stable over the antiferromagnetic one. Of the different compounds studied, the Cr based systems exhibit the strongest interatomic exchange interactions, and are hence predicted to have the highest critical temperatures. Also, we predict that VAs under certain growth conditions should be a semiconducting ferromagnet.

Although the ground state is of NA structure, RS and ZB are interesting in that these fcc-based structures, which can perhaps be grown on various semiconductor substrates, exhibit half-metallic (HM) phases above some critical values of the lattice parameter. We find that the NA structure is not HM at its equilibrium volume while both ZB and RS structures are. The RS structure is more stable than the ZB with an energy that is lower by 0.25 eV/atom. While confirming previous results on the HM phase in ZB structure, we provide hitherto unreported results on the HM RS phase, with a gap in the minority channel and a magnetic moment of 4.0 mu(B)/f.u. A comparison of total energies for the ferromagnetic (FM), nonmagnetic, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations shows the lowest energy configuration to be FM for CrTe in all the three structures. The exchange interactions in the RS and ZB structures are studied for a wide range of the lattice parameter using the linear-response method and a mapping of the total energy to the classical Heisenberg model. These linear-response calculations are performed in the linear muffin-tin orbitals (LMTOs) basis, using the atomic sphere approximation (ASA). We have verified that the results of the electronic structure obtained via the LMTO-ASA method under local-density approximation (LDA) and LDA+ U schemes are in close agreement with those obtained via the more accurate FP-LAPW method. The results show that the exchange interactions in the RS structure are much more short ranged than in the ZB structure.

In spite of some unusual features in electrical transport and Hall measurements below 100 K, only one phase transition is found in the temperature range from 2 to 750 K corresponding to long-range antiferromagnetic order below T-N approximate to 273 K. Many of the low-temperature properties can be explained by the thermal depopulation of carriers from the conduction band into a low-mobility band located approximately 16 meV below the conduction-band edge, as deduced from the Hall effect data. In analogy with what occurs in Ge, the low-mobility band is likely an impurity band. The Seebeck coefficient, S, is large and negative for temperatures from 2 to 300 K ranging from approximate to -70 mu V/K at 300 K to -4500 mu V/K at 18 K. A large maximum in vertical bar S vertical bar at 18 K is likely due to phonon drag, with the abrupt drop in vertical bar S vertical bar below 18 K due to the thermal depopulation of the high-mobility conduction band. The large thermal conductivity between 10 and 20 K (approximate to 350 W/m K) is consistent with this interpretation, as are detailed calculations of the Seebeck coefficient made using the complete calculated electronic structure. These data are compared to data reported for FeSb2, which crystallizes in the same marcasite structure, and FeSi, another unusual narrow-gap semiconductor.

The results indicate that the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for CrSb2 did not change obviously after Sn substitution for Sb. However, the magnitude of the resistivity for CrSb2-xSnx decreased monotonically with increasing Sn content. Moreover, absolute value of thermopower vertical bar S vertical bar decreased continuously with increasing Sn content although its temperature behavior was not influenced substantially by Sn doping. The decrease of both the resistivity and vertical bar S vertical bar could be ascribed to the increase in electron concentration caused indirectly by Sn substitution for Sb. Additionally, experiments showed that low-temperature lattice thermal conductivity (below similar to 100 K) of CrSb2-xSnx generally decreased with increasing Sn content, which could be explained as an enhancement of phonon scattering by increased number of Sn atoms. The thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, of doped compounds CrSb2-xSnx (x > 0) decreased as compared to that of un-doped CrSb2 due to substantial decrease in vertical bar S vertical bar after doping.

Our results show that this potential does not yield visible changes in wide TM d-t(2g) bands near the Fermi level, but makes the occupied minority-spin p-bands lower by 0.25-0.35 eV and the empty (or nearly empty) minority-spin e(g) bands across the Fermi level higher by 0.33-0.73 eV. Consequently, mBJLDA, having no atom-dependent parameters, makes zincblende MnAs become a truly half-metallic (HM) ferromagnet with a HM gap (the key parameter) 0.318 eV, being consistent with experiment. For zincblende MnSb, CrAs, CrSb, CrSe, or CrTe, the HM gap is enhanced by 19-56% compared to LDA and generalized gradient approximation results.

Our results show that the decrease in the A-B bond length as the electronegativity of X increases is significantly larger than that found for the corresponding acyclic analogs. In general, a systematic substitution of the -CH2 groups of cyclopropane by -NH or -O groups implies significant geometric changes that are not reflected in a parallel change of the corresponding conventional ring strain energy (CRSE). When the electronegativity of the groups forming the TMR increases the effect on the CRSE of the system is small, although the charge delocalization inside the ring decreases. The near constancy of the CRSE along the series can be explained in terms of the charge redistribution of the system where the -CH2 groups play a crucial role. There are, however, significant changes in the hydrogenation energies of the TMR investigated; our results show that, when in an ABX three-membered ring, the electronegativity of X increases the hydrogenation energy of A-B bond decreases and vice versa.

Comparison of the measured K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratios with the results of multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) calculations indicates a significant increase of the 3d electron population (in relation to the pure metals) for Cr in CrSe (by 1.0 +/- 0.3) and for Mn in MnS (by 0.9 +/- 0.3). Our K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratio for Co in CoS does not show any significant change of 3d electron population. The only observed increase of the K beta-to-K alpha intensity ratio for Mn in MnSe indicates the decrease of the number of 3d electrons by 0.6 +/- 0.3. To explain evaluated changes of the 3d electron population for all the compounds, one can consider either rearrangement of electrons between 3d and 4s states of the metal or transfer of electrons from the 3d state of the metal to the ligand atom or vice versa. Although the sulphide compounds (MnS, CoS) show similar behaviour, the selenide compounds (CrSe, MnSe) show opposite behaviour which may be attributed to anomalous behaviour of rearrangement of electrons between the valence states of Cr as it happens in the case of free atom. The d-p hybridization effect which was not taken into account in our model theoretical calculation may be partly responsible for the increased K beta-to-K alpha ratio of Mn in MnSe and a comparison of the results for MnS and MnSe suggests that the nature of covalent bonding in MnSe is stronger than that of MnS.

The photoelectron spectrum of [(eta-C5H4iPr)MoS]4 has been measured using synchrotron radiation over the photon energy range 21-80 eV. Relative partial photoionization cross section and photoelectron branching ratio data are presented for the first six valence bands (binding energy 5.0-10.5 eV). The cross sections of the d bands show a p --> d giant resonance in the photon energy range 39-60 eV. Intensity variations are interpreted in terms of the atomic orbital contributions to the molecular orbitals from which ionization is occurring. Similarities are observed between the low binding energy (4.8-7.5 eV) regions of the spectra of the sulfur and selenium derivatives of the group 6 elements and are interpreted in terms of ionization from molecular orbitals, composed largely of metal d-orbitals, delocalized over the metal tetrahedron. The molecular ion state ordering 2T2 < 2E < 2A1 is observed, the 2T2 and 2E states showing Jahn-Teller splitting. The a1 and e orbitals are metal-metal bonding whereas the t2 orbitals are nonbonding. Subsequent bands are assigned to cyclopentadienyl pi-orbitals and to metal-chalcogen bonding orbitals. The spectrum of [(eta-C5H4Me)VS]4 is consistent with an a(1)2e4t2(2) ground-state configuration for the metal-based orbitals, ionization from these three orbitals being easily identified.

The results show that both the activity of the catalyst and its stabilization towards deactivation decrease with increasing pressure, and the catalyst maintains substantially higher activity when feed rate exceeds 4.00 ml/min under supercritical conditions. A first-order Langmuir kinetic model with a novel decay function is developed for the supercritical catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon incorporating supercritical extraction effect on catalyst stability, which is satisfactory to describe the kinetic behaviors of catalytic cracking of supercritical n-dodecane. According to the estimated reaction rate and adsorption constant of n-dodecane on HZSM-5 at different temperature, the activation energy of 125.4 kJ/mol and adsorption heat 109.5 kJ/mol were calculated. An index of CRSE is proposed to define contribution ratio of supercritical extraction to the activity of the HZSM-5 catalyst in the developed kinetics model, and it is found that the CRSE increases with increasing hydrocarbon feed rates and decreasing catalytic activities, and reaches maximum value when the coke formation rate equals to the coke removal rate by supercritical hydrocarbon.

The magnetic polarization antiparallel to the Cr moment is induced at the neighboring Tc, Se and S sites, respectively, and a magnitude of the induced moment decreases in the order of CrTe, CrSe and CrS.

The calculations are performed for zinc blende structure for 12 values of the lattice parameter between 5.44 and 6.62 angstrom, appropriate for some typical II-VI and III-V semiconducting substrates. Electronic structure is calculated via the linear muffin-tin-orbitals (LMTOs) method in the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) using empty spheres to optimize ASA-related errors. Whenever necessary, the results have been verified using the full-potential version of the method, FP-LMTO. The disorder effect in the As-sublattice for CrAs(50)X(50) (X = Sb, S, Se, Te) alloys is taken into account via the coherent-potential approximation. Exchange interactions are calculated using the linear-response method for the ferromagnetic (FM) reference states of the alloys as well as the disordered local moments (DLM) states. These results are then used to estimate the Curie temperature from the low- and high-temperature sides of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. Estimates of the Curie temperature are provided based on the mean field and the more accurate random-phase approximations.

By using a full-potential augmented plane-wave plus local-orbitals method within density-functional theory, we find two promising series of monolayer superlattices (MSLs), CrX/FeX and VX/CoX, where two constituent magnetic ions in a supercell have antialigned local moments that exactly cancel by virtue of the integer filling of one spin channel.

Importantly, for these five half-metallic compounds, the rocksalt phase is energetically more stable than the zinc-blende and wurtzite ones, and the total energy differences between the rocksalt and ground-state NiAs phases are very small (0.06-0.43 eV/f.u.) and comparable with that of experimental MnTe (0.24 eV/f.u.), thus like rocksalt manganese chalcogenides, these five rocksalt half-metals would be realized in the form of bulk or at list thin films for spintronic applications.

This study provides a replication of the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) and a head-to-head comparison with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale designed to include a wider continuum of activity difficulty and more detailed item descriptors.\n\nMethods. Items For the newly developed 16-item ABC Scale were generated by 15 clinicians and 12 elderly outpatients. Psychometric testing involved 60 community seniors (aged 65-95) self-classified as either high or low in mobility confidence according to their perceived need for a walking aid and personal assistance to ambulate outdoors.\n\nResults. Both the FES and ABC scales were found to he internally consistent and demonstrated good test-retest reliability, convergent and criterion validity. Scalogram analyses indicated a stronger cumulative scale in the case of the ABC and skewness in the distribution of FES scores. While both scales were able to discriminate between the two mobility groups, the ABC scale was a more efficient discriminator and yielded a wider range of responses.\n\nConclusions.

In the coldest portions of these objects, we propose that the major grain species include olivine ([Fe, Mg]2SiO4), orthopyroxene ([Fe, Mg]SiO3), volatile and refractory organics, water ice, troilite (FeS), and metallic iron. This compositional model differs from almost all previous models of the interstellar medium (ISM) by having organics as the major condensed C species, rather than graphite; by including troilite as a major grain species; and by specifying the mineralogical composition of the condensed silicates. Using a combination of laboratory measurements of optical constants and asymptotic theory, we derive values of the real and imaginary indices of refraction of these grain species over a wavelength range that runs from the vacuum UV to the radio domain.\n\nThe above information on grain properties is used to estimate the Rosseland mean opacity of the grains and their monochromatic opacity. We find that organics are the largest contributors to the Rosseland mean extinction coefficient at temperatures below their vaporization temperatures (similar or equal to 575 K in molecular cloud cores and 425 K in accretion disks), and that silicates and metallic iron jointly determine the Rosseland mean opacity at higher temperatures. At mid-infrared wavelengths, the computed monochromatic opacities are in approximate accord with the spectral characteristics of ''astronomical silicates.'' At low temperatures (<500 K), the position, strength, width, and contrast of the 10 and 20 mu m silicate vibrational fundamentals can be significantly affected by the opacities of organics and water ice. Strong silicate features are produced only when the average grain size is less than several tens of microns.\n\nThe spectral index beta of the grain opacity at long wavelengths shows marked variation. In particular, we estimate that it has a value of about 2.5 between 100 and 650 mu m and a value of about 1.5 between 650 mu m and 2.7 mm for submicron- to millimeter-sized grains, in rough agreement with spectral flux measurements of the ISM and some disks around young stars. In the latter spectral region, grain opacity is dominated by silicates, with important contributions also coming from troilite and organics. However, the low values of beta (similar to 0) that appear to characterize a few disks around young stars in the 650 mu m to 2.7 mm region may be the result of significant grain growth that has occurred in these disks (sizes greater than or equal to 10 cm). In a similar vein, existing-far infrared spectral data for the older, Vega-like objects are consistent with grain sizes on the order of hundreds to thousands of microns. We also find that the grain absorption coefficient at 1 mm wavelength lies within a factor of 4 of 5 x 10(-3) cm(2) g-l (of gas and dust) for a wide variety of grain shapes and for grain sizes ranging from submicron to several millimeters. Thus, continuum flux values at 1 mm wavelength can lead to useful estimates of disk masses.", "ISSN": "0004-637X", "pub": "ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL", "volume": "421", "authors": ["POLLACK, JB", "HOLLENBACH, D", "BECKWITH, S", "SIMONELLI, DP", "ROUSH, T", "FONG, W"], "issue": "2", "pages": "615-639"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 25 1992", "title": "THE NEW ENZYMOLOGY OF PRECURSOR PROCESSING ENDOPROTEASES", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "267", "authors": ["STEINER, DF", "SMEEKENS, SP", "OHAGI, S", "CHAN, SJ"], "issue": "33", "pages": "23435-23438"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 1989", "title": "MEASUREMENT OF BACTERIAL SULFATE REDUCTION IN SEDIMENTS - EVALUATION OF A SINGLE-STEP CHROMIUM REDUCTION METHOD", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0168-2563", "pub": "BIOGEOCHEMISTRY", "volume": "8", "authors": ["FOSSING, H", "JORGENSEN, BB"], "issue": "3", "pages": "205-222"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/nature10405", "pdflink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7367/extref/nature10405-s1.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 6 2011", "title": "Genetic variants in novel pathways influence blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk", "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7367/full/nature10405.html", "abstract": "Blood pressure is a heritable trait(1) influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli.

Twelve composite materials systems were found to have the capacity to meet or exceed the annual worldwide electricity consumption of 17 000 TWh, of which nine have the potential for a significant cost reduction over crystalline silicon.

Deletion of the Azotobacter vinelandii nifS gene lowers the activities of both nitrogenase component proteins. Because both nitrogenase component proteins have metallocluster prosthetic groups that are composed of iron- and sulfur-containing cores, this result indicated that the nifS gene product could be involved in the mobilization of the iron or sulfur required for metallocluster formation.  In the present work, it is shown that NIFS is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing homodimer that catalyzes the formation of L-alanine and elemental sulfur by using L-cysteine as substrate. NIFS activity is extremely sensitive to thiol-specific alkylating reagents, which indicates the participation of a cysteinyl thiolate at the active site. Based on these results we propose that an enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide that requires the release of the sulfur from the substrate L-cysteine for its formation ultimately provides the inorganic sulfide required for nitrogenase metallocluster formation.

In locations where access of oxidants to sulfide mineral surfaces is increased by mining, the resulting acid mine drainage (AMD) may contaminate surrounding ecosystems. Communities of autotrophic and heterotrophic archaea and bacteria catalyze iron and sulfur oxidation, thus may ultimately determine the rate of release of metals and sulfur to the environment. AMD communities contain fewer prokaryotic lineages than many other environments. However, it is notable that at least two archaeal and eight bacterial divisions have representatives able to thrive under the extreme conditions typical of AMD. AMD communities are characterized by a very limited number of distinct species, probably due to the small number of metabolically beneficial reactions available. The metabolisms that underpin these communities include organoheterotrophy and autotrophic iron and sulfur oxidation. Other metabolic activity is based on anaerobic sulfur oxidation and ferric iron reduction. Evidence for physiological synergy in iron, sulfur, and carbon flow in these communities is reviewed.

This front occurred where hot(c. 150 degrees C), extremely reduced, alkaline, bisulphide-bearing, submarine seepage waters interfaced with the acid, warm (c. 90 degrees C), iron-bearing Hadean ocean. The low pH of the ocean was imparted by the ten bars of CO2 considered to dominate the Hadean atmosphere/hydrosphere. Disequilibrium between the two solutions was maintained by the spontaneous precipitation of a colloidal FeS membrane. Iron monosulphide bubbles comprising this membrane were inflated by the hydrothermal solution upon sulphide mounds at the seepage sites. Our hypothesis is that the FeS membrane, laced with nickel, acted as a semipermeable catalytic boundary between the two fluids, encouraging synthesis of organic anions by hydrogenation and carboxylation of hydrothermal organic primers. The ocean provided carbonate, phosphate, iron, nickel and protons; the hydrothermal solution was the source of ammonia, acetate. HS-, H-2 and tungsten, as well as minor concentrations of organic sulphides and perhaps cyanide and acetaldehyde. The mean redox potential (Delta Eh) across the membrane, with the energy to drive synthesis, would have approximated to 300 millivolts. The generation of organic anions would have led to an increase in osmotic pressure within the FeS bubbles. Thus osmotic pressure could take over from hydraulic pressure as the driving force for distension, budding and reproduction of the bubbles.\n\nCondensation of the organic molecules to polymers, particularly organic sulphides, was driven by pyrophosphate hydrolysis. Regeneration of pyrophosphate from the monophosphate in the membrane was facilitated by protons contributed from the Hadean ocean. This was the first use by a metabolizing system of protonmotive force (driven by natural Delta pH) which also would have amounted to c. 300 millivolts. Protonmotive force is the universal energy transduction mechanism of life. Taken together with the redox potential across the membrane, the total electrochemical and chemical energy available for protometabolism amounted to a continuous supply at more than half a volt.\n\nThe role of the iron sulphide membrane in keeping the two solutions separated was appropriated by the newly synthesized organic sulphide polymers. This organic take-over of the membrane material led to the miniaturization of the metabolizing system. Information systems to govern replication could have developed penecontemporaneously in this same milieu.

In this report we demonstrate that these two proteases can cleave proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells. Similarly to pituitary corticotrophs, PC3 expressed in processing-deficient BSC-40 cells cleaved native mouse POMC at the -Lys-Arg- sites flanking corticotropin. The -Lys-Arg- within beta-lipotropin was less efficiently cleaved to release beta-endorphin. Expression of PC2 together with PC3 resulted in efficient conversion of beta-lipotropin, as occurs in pituitary melanotrophs. Furthermore, coexpression of PC2 together with mouse POMC in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells resulted in conversion of beta-lipotropin to gamma-lipotropin and beta-endorphin in the regulated secretory pathway. Finally, the processing selectivities of PC3 and PC2 expressed together in BSC-40 cells were determined by using a series of mutant mouse POMCs containing all possible pairs of basic residues at certain sites. The observed pattern of cleavage site selectivities mimicked that of the endogenous endoproteases of the insulinoma and bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, suggesting that PC2 and PC3 may represent important core endoproteases in the catalysis of prohormone processing in many neuroendocrine cell types.", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "pub": "PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA", "volume": "88", "authors": ["THOMAS, L", "LEDUC, R", "THORNE, BA", "SMEEKENS, SP", "STEINER, DF", "THOMAS, G"], "issue": "12", "pages": "5297-5301"}, {"DOI": "10.1126/science.1082596", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/300/5621/949.full.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 9 2003", "title": "Mutational analysis of the tyrosine kinome in colorectal cancers", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/300/5621/949", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0036-8075", "pub": "SCIENCE", "volume": "300", "authors": ["Bardelli, A", "Parsons, DW", "Silliman, N", "Ptak, J", "Szabo, S", "Saha, S", "Markowitz, S", "Willson, JKV", "Parmigiani, G", "Kinzler, KW", "Vogelstein, B", "Velculescu, VE"], "issue": "5621", "pages": "949-949"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0304-386X(00)00180-8", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304386X00001808/pdfft?md5=8556818a41b2858d019a7d7798e43761&pid=1-s2.0-S0304386X00001808-main.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2001", "title": "(Bio) chemistry of bacterial leaching - direct vs. indirect bioleaching", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304386X00001808", "abstract": "Bioleaching of metal sulfides is effected by bacteria, like Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, Sulfolobus/Acidianus, etc., via the (re)generation of iron(III) ions and sulfuric acid.\n\nAccording to the new integral model for bioleaching presented here, metal sulfides are degraded by a chemical attack of iron(III) ions and/or protons on the crystal lattice. The primary iron(III) ions are supplied by the bacterial extracellular polymeric substances, where they are complexed to glucuronic acid residues. The mechanism and chemistry of the degradation is determined by the mineral structure.\n\nThe disulfides pyrite (FeS2), molybdenite (MoS2), and tungstenite (WS2) are degraded via the main intermediate thiosulfate. Exclusively iron(III) ions are the oxidizing agents for the dissolution. Thiosulfate is, consequently, degraded in a cyclic process to sulfate, with elemental sulfur being a side product. This explains, why only iron(II) ion-oxidizing bacteria are able to oxidize these metal sulfides.\n\nThe metal sulfides galena (PbS), sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), hauerite (MnS2), orpiment (As2S3), and realgar (As4S4) are degradable by iron(III) ion and proton attack. Consequently, the main intermediates are polysulfides and elemental sulfur (thiosulfate is only a by-product of further degradation steps). The dissolution proceeds via a H2S*(+)-radical and polysulfides to elemental sulfur. Thus, these metal sulfides are degradable by all bacteria able to oxidize sulfur compounds (like T. thiooxidans, etc.). The kinetics of these processes are dependent on the concentration of the iron(III) ions and, in the latter case, on the solubility product of the metal sulfide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In recent years, a considerable body of observational data has accumulated that indicates very different behavior for various trace metals in sulfidic sediments. These differences in behavior cannot be entirely attributed to thermodynamic relationships, but also reflect differences in ligand exchange reaction kinetics, and redox reaction pathways.\n\nPb, Zn, and Cd, which are generally pyritized to only a few percent of the \"reactive\" fraction, have faster water exchange reaction kinetics than Fe2+ resulting in MeS phases precipitating prior to FeS formation and subsequent pyrite formation, whereas, Co and Ni, which have slower H2O exchange kinetics than Fe2+, are incorporated into pyrite. Although Hg and Cu have faster reaction kinetics than Fe2+, both are incorporated into pyrite or leached from the pyrite fraction with nitric acid. Hg undergoes significant chloride complexation, which can retard reaction with sulfide, but can also replace Fe in FeS to form HgS, which can only be dissolved in the pyrite fraction. Cu2+ is reduced by sulfide and forms a variety of sulfides with and without Fe that can only be dissolved with nitric acid. Mn2+ does not form a MnS phase easily and is incorporated into pyrite at high iron degrees of pyritization (DOP).\n\nOxyanions of Mo and As are first reduced by sulfide. These reduced forms may then react with sulfides resulting in incorporation into pyrite. However, the oxyanion of Cr is reduced to Cr3+, which is kinetically inert to reaction with sulfide and, therefore, not incorporated into pyrite.

Four types of Fe-bearing solids, siderite [FeCO3], pyrite [FeS2], coarse-grained elemental iron [Fe-0], and fine-grained Fe-0, were assessed for their ability to remove dissolved Cr(VI) from solution at flow rates typical of those encountered at sites of remediation. Batch studies show that the rate of Cr(VI) removal by fine-grained Fe-0 is greater than that for pyrite and coarse-grained Fe-0. Results from column studies suggest that partial removal of Cr(VI)) by pyrite and coarse-grained Fe-0 and quantitative removal of Cr(VI) by fine-grained Fe-0 occur at rapid groundwater flow velocities. The removal mechanism for Cr(VI) by fine-grained Fea and coarse-grained Fe-0 is through the reduction of Cr(Vl) to Cr(III), coupled with the oxidation of Fe-0 to Fe(II) and Fe(III), and the subsequent precipitation of a sparingly soluble Fe(III)-Cr(III) (oxy)hydroxide phase. Mineralogical analysis of the reactive material used in the batch tests indicates that Cr is associated with goethite(alpha-FeOOH). These results suggest th at Cr(lll) is removed either th ro ugh the formation of a solid solution or by adsorption of Cr(III) onto the goethite surface.

Physical compartmentation from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things, hence inorganic matter with such attributes would be life's most likely forebear. We propose that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage site hydrothermal mound at a redox, pH and temperature gradient between sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(II)-containing waters of the Hadean ocean floor. The naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. The known capability of FeS and NiS to catalyse the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments, which furthermore restrained reacted products from diffusion into the ocean, providing sufficient concentrations of reactants to forge the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. The chemistry of what is known as the RNA-world could have taken place within these naturally forming, catalytic-walled compartments to give rise to replicating systems. Sufficient concentrations of precursors to support replication would have been synthesized in situ geochemically and biogeochemically, with FeS (and NiS) centres playing the central catalytic role. The universal ancestor we infer was not a free-living cell, but rather was confined to the naturally chemiosmotic, FeS compartments within which the synthesis of its constituents occurred. The first free-living cells are suggested to have been eubacterial and archaebacterial chemoautotrophs that emerged more than 3.8 Gyr ago from their inorganic confines. We propose that the emergence of these prokaryotic lineages from inorganic confines occurred independently, facilitated by the independent origins of membrane-lipid biosynthesis: isoprenoid ether membranes in the archaebacterial and fatty acid ester membranes in the eubacterial lineage. The eukaryotes, all of which are ancestrally heterotrophs and possess eubacterial lipids, are suggested to have arisen ca. 2 Gyr ago through symbiosis involving an autotrophic archaebacterial host and a heterotrophic eubacterial symbiont, the common ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The attributes shared by all prokaryotes are viewed as inheritances from their confined universal ancestor. The attributes that distinguish eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet are uniform within the groups, are viewed as relics of their phase of differentiation after divergence from the non-free-living universal ancestor and before the origin of the free-living chemoautotrophic lifestyle. The attributes shared by eukaryotes with eubacteria and archaebacteria, respectively, are viewed as inheritances via symbiosis. The attributes unique to eukaryotes are viewed as inventions specific to their lineage. The origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system and nuclear membrane are suggested to be the fortuitous result of the expression of genes for eubacterial membrane lipid synthesis by an archaebacterial genetic apparatus in a compartment that was not fully prepared to accommodate such compounds, resulting in vesicles of eubacterial lipids that accumulated in the cytosol around their site of synthesis.\n\nUnder these premises, the most ancient divide in the living world is that between eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet the steepest evolutionary grade is that between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.", "ISSN": "0962-8436", "pub": "PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "volume": "358", "authors": ["Martin, W", "Russell, MJ"], "issue": "1429", "pages": "59-83"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00289-0", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703798002890/pdfft?md5=f054bee66b06290be7dacaaf1403919b&pid=1-s2.0-S0016703798002890-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 1999", "title": "The relative effects of pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity on the solubility of sulfide in mafic magmas", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703798002890", "abstract": "The sulfur contents at sulfide saturation (SCSS) of a basaltic and a picritic melt have been measured experimentally as a function of pressure and temperature from 5 to 90 kb and 1400-1800 degrees C, using piston-cylinder and multi-anvil solid media pressure devices. Three distinct regimes of oxygen fugacity were investigated, imposed by the use of Fe-100, Fe40Ir60, and Fe20Ir80 capsules. The compositions of quenched run products, including the S contents of the silicate glasses, were determined by electron microprobe analysis. Theoretical considerations suggest that SCSS values (in ppm) can be described by an equation of the form:\n\nA In[S/ppm](SCSS) = A/T + B + CP/T + In a(FeS)(sulfide)\n\nwhere A and B are functions of the composition of the silicate melt. This equation implies that SCSS is independent of fO(2) and fS(2), except insofar as these factors influence the nature of the sulfide liquid (hence a(FeS)(sulfide)). The experiments reported here confirm this. The SCSS of both the basaltic and picritic compositions are rather insensitive to temperature, but show a strong exponential decrease with increasing pressure. Consequently, a magma generated in equilibrium with residual sulfide in the mantle becomes under saturated in sulfide during adiabatic ascent. At low pressure, sulfide saturation should occur only after substantial crystallization, under closed-system conditions, or after significant modification via assimilation (e.g., of S-rich sediments).

Quinol:cytochrome c oxido-reductase ('bc(1) complex') is not present. For various electron accepters (O-2, nitrate) and donors (formate, H-2, NADH, glycerol-3-P) isoenzymes are present. The enzymes show great variability in membrane topology and energy conservation. Energy is conserved by conformational proton pumps, or by arrangement of substrate sites on opposite sides of the membrane resulting in charge separation. Depending on the enzymes and isoenzymes used, the H+/e(-) ratios are between 0 and 4 H+/e(-) for the overall chain. The expression of the terminal reductases is regulated by electron accepters. O-2 is the preferred electron acceptor and represses the terminal reductases of anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, nitrate represses other terminal reductases, such as fumarate or DMSO reductases. Energy conservation is maximal with O-2 and lowest with fumarate. By this regulation pathways with high ATP or growth yields are favoured. The expression of the dehydrogenases is regulated by the electron accepters, too. In aerobic growth, non-coupling dehydrogenases are expressed and used preferentially, whereas in fumarate or DMSO respiration coupling dehydrogenases are essential. Coupling and non-coupling isoenzymes are expressed correspondingly. Thus the rationale for expression of the dehydrogenases is not maximal energy yield, but could be maximal flux or growth rates. Nitrate regulation is effected by two-component signal transfer systems with membraneous nitrate/nitrite sensors (NarX, NarQ) and cytoplasmic response regulators (NarL, NarP) which communicate by protein phosphorylation. O-2 regulates by a two-component regulatory system consisting of a membraneous sensor (ArcB) and a response regulator (ArcA). ArcA is the major regulator of aerobic metabolism and represses the genes of aerobic metabolism under anaerobic conditions. FNR is a cytoplasmic O-2 responsive regulator with a sensory and a regulatory DNA-binding domain. FNR is the regulator of genes required for anaerobic respiration and related pathways. The binding sites of NarL, NarP, ArcA and FNR are characterized for various promoters. Most of the genes are regulated by more than one of the regulators, which can act in any combination and in a positive or negative mode. By this the hierarchical expression of the genes in response to the electron acceptors is achieved. FNR is located in the cytoplasm and contains a 4Fe4S cluster in the sensory domain. The regulatory concentrations of O-2 are 1-5 mbar. Under these conditions O-2 diffuses to the cytoplasm and is able to react directly with FNR without involvement of other specific enzymes or protein mediators. By oxidation of the FeS cluster, FNR is converted to the inactive state in a reversible process. Reductive activation could be achieved by cellular reductants in the absence of O-2. In addition, O-2 may cause destruction and loss of the FeS cluster, It is not known whether this process is required for regulation of FNR function.

Microprobe analyses of total S in rapidly quenched, submarine basalt glasses, used in conjunction with wet chemical analyses of Fe2O3/FeO and its relationship to f(O2), allow direct calculation of f(S2) using an expression which relates dissolved sulfur content to sulfur fugacity. The relationship between S fugacity and dissolved S in a silicate liquid at 1 bar total pressure can be represented by the expression 1n X(S) = a 1n f(S2) - b 1n f(O2) + c 1n X(FeO) + d/T + e + SIGMA-f(i)X(i), where X(S) is the mole fraction of dissolved S, a through f(i) are experimentally calibrated regression coefficients, and the summation is over melt components, i.

In addition to these functionals, we also examine the effectiveness of scaling the correlation energy by testing 13 functionals with scaled or no gradient-corrected correlation energy, and we find that functionals of this kind are more accurate for metal-metal and metal-ligand bonds than any of the functionals already in the literature.

The spatial distribution of As in the mine wastes (at several micrometers spatial resolution) was determined by electron microprobe analyses.

Non-linear, least-squares fits of mine waste EXAFS (Extended XAFS) spectra indicate variable As speciation in each of the three mine wastes: As5+, the Ruth Mine sample is sorbed on ferric oxyhydroxides and aluminosilicates (probably clay) in roughly equal portions.

In many sedimentary environments, a zone exists which releases H2S if treated with acid. The materials that produce this sulfide are described as acid volatile sulfides or AVS and the sulfide which is evolved and collected by this treatment is called acid volatile sulfide (AVS-S). In this research review we show that AVS represents part of a complex and dynamic biogeochemical system which is not defined simply by the analysis of AVS-S.\n\nDuring the 40 years since R.A. Berner first defined the concept of acid volatile sulfide, a number of scientific myths have developed regarding the nature and composition of AVS and its role in the global sulfur cycle. We show that:\n\nAVS is not equivalent to FeS and solid FeS phases have rarely been identified in marine sediments. AVS is a complex and variable component which does not represent any singular or simple group of sediment components.\n\nThe commonly used extraction methods do not quantitatively extract AVS minerals (mackinawite and greigite) without also significantly releasing sulfide from pyrite.\n\nAVS varies geographically and AVS is not the same component or set of components wherever it is found.\n\nThe solubilities of FeS and Fe3S4 in neutral to alkaline systems are presently poorly constrained and pore water saturation state calculations cannot be used to support the presence of specific AVS minerals.\n\nThe colored zone in sediments does not reflect the distribution of AVS.\n\nAVS is not always a minor fraction of total reduced sulfide (TRS) which dominantly occurs near the sediment water interface. AVS minerals are not required precursors for pyrite formation.\n\nA better understanding of the sedimentary sulfur system, including its nature, formation and transformations, is a key component in understanding the evolution of the Earth and its future development. However, some basic parameters, such as the solubility and composition of the metastable iron sulfide solids, are still not constrained. Even the presence of these minerals in most sedimentary systems remains equivocal. Aqueous FeS clusters appear to be ubiquitous and appear to have significant geochemical and biological roles. The roles of organisms, especially in modifying rates and products, remain a key area of research.\n\nAlthough AVS may have served its purpose in the earlier exploratory days of the study of sedimentary sulfides, the concept is now probably more of a hindrance than a help in advancing this field. It is reasonable to question if it is not time to simply do away with the AVS concept altogether and get on with the business of trying to deal more directly with the behavior of the more important components known to fall within the group of sulfide species that contribute to sulfide that is volatilized when acid is added to a sediment.

We examined the rates of superoxide generation (measured as hydrogen peroxide production) by rat skeletal muscle mitochondria under a variety of conditions. The rate of superoxide production by complex I during NADH-linked forward electron transport was less than 10% of that during succinate-linked reverse electron transport even when complex I was fully reduced by pyruvate plus malate in the presence of the complex III inhibitor, stigmatellin. This asymmetry was not explained by differences in protonmotive force or its components. However, when inhibitors of the quinone-binding site of complex I were added in the presence of ATP to generate a pH gradient, there was a rapid rate of superoxide production by forward electron transport that was as great as the rate seen with reverse electron transport at the same pH gradient. These observations suggest that quinone-binding site inhibitors can make complex I adopt the highly radical-producing state that occurs during reverse electron transport. Despite complete inhibition of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity in each case, different classes of quinone-binding site inhibitor (rotenone, piericidin, and high concentrations of myxothiazol) gave different rates of superoxide production during forward electron transport (the rate with myxothiazol was twice that with rotenone) suggesting that the site of rapid superoxide generation by complex I is in the region of the ubisemiquinone-binding sites and not upstream at the flavin or low potential FeS centers.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "279", "authors": ["Lambert, AJ", "Brand, MD"], "issue": "38", "pages": "39414-39420"}, {"DOI": "10.1029/1998RG000053", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAY 2000", "title": "High-pressure experiments and the phase diagram of lower mantle and core materials", "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1998RG000053", "abstract": "The interpretation of seismic data and computer modeling requires increased accuracy in relevant material properties in order to improve our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the Earth's deep interior. To obtain such properties, a complementary method to classic shock compression experiments and theoretical calculations is the use of laser-heated diamond cells, which are now producing accurate data on phase diagrams, equations of state, and melting. Data on one of the most important measurements, the melting temperatures of iron at very high pressure, are now converging. Two other issues linking core properties to those of iron are investigated in the diamond cell: One is the melting point depression of iron in the presence of light elements, and the other is the structure of iron at the conditions of the inner core. First measurements on eutectic systems indicate a significant decrease in the melting point depression with increasing pressure, which is in contrast to previous predictions. X-ray diffraction measurements at simultaneously high pressure and high temperature have improved significantly with the installation of high-pressure \"beam lines\" at synchrotron facilities, and structural measurements on iron are in progress. Considerable efforts have been made to develop new techniques to heat minerals at the conditions of the deep mantle in the diamond cell and to measure their phase relations reliably. Even measurements of the melting behavior of realistic rock compositions at high pressure, previously considered to be impossible in the diamond cell, have been reported. The extrapolated solidus of the lower mantle intersects the geotherm at the core-mantle boundary, which may explain the seismically observed ultra low velocity zone. The diamond cell has great potential for future development and broad application, as new measurements on high-pressure-geochemistry at deep mantle and core conditions have opened a new field of research.

Although a comprehensive description of several techniques and approaches is given, most of this paper has been devoted to the so called axiomatic theories and related finite element implementations. Most of the theories and finite elements that have been proposed over the last thirty years are in fact based on these types of approaches. The paper has been divided into three parts.\n\nPart I, has been devoted to the description of possible approaches to plate and shell structures: 3D approaches, continuum based methods, axiomatic and asymptotic two-dimensional theories, classical and mixed formulations, equivalent single layer and layer wise variable descriptions are considered (the number of the unknown variables is considered to be independent of the number of the constitutive layers in the equivalent single layer case). Complicating effects that have been introduced by anisotropic behavior and layered constructions, such as high transverse deformabilty, zig-zag effects and interlaminar continuity, have been discussed and summarized by the acronim C-z(0)-Requirements.\n\nTwo-dimensional theories have been dealt with in Part II. Contributions based on axiomatic, asymtotic and continuum based approches have been overviewed. Classical theories and their refinements are first considered. Both case of equivalent single-layer and layer-wise variables descriptions are discussed. The so-called zig-zag theories are then discussed. A complete and detailed overview has been conducted for this type of theory which relies on an approach that is entirely originated and devoted to layered constructions. Formulas and contributions related to the three possible zig-zag approaches, i.e. Lekhnitskii-Ren, Ambartsumian-Whitney-Rath-Das, Reissner-Murakami-Carrera ones have been presented and overviewed, taking into account the findings of a recent historical note provided by the author. Finite Element FE implementations are examined in Part III. The possible developments of finite elements for layered plates and shells are first outlined. FEs based on the theories considered in Part II are discussed along with those approaches which consist of a specific application of finite element techniques, such as hybrid methods and so-called global/local techniques. The extension of finite elements that were originally developed for isotropic one layered structures to multilayerd plates and shells are first discussed. Works based on classical and refined theories as well as on equivalent single layer and layer-wise descriptions have been overviewed. Development of available zig-zag finite elements has been considered for the three cases of zig-zag theories. Finite elements based on other approches are also discussed.

Subcultures in defined mineral media with ferrous iron (10 mmol/liter, mostly precipitated as FeCO3) yielded enrichments of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria which used ferrous iron as the sole electron donor for photosynthesis. Two different types of purple bacteria, represented by strains L7 and SW2, were isolated which oxidized colorless ferrous iron under anoxic conditions in the light to brown ferric iron. Strain L7 had rod-shaped, nonmotile cells (1.3 by 2 to 3 mu m) which frequently formed gas vesicles. In addition to ferrous iron, strain L7 used H-2+CO2, acetate, pyruvate, and glucose as substrates for phototrophic growth. Strain SW2 had small rod-shaped, nonmotile cells (0.5 by 1 to 1.5 mu m). Besides ferrous iron, strain SW2 utilized H-2+CO2, monocarboxylic acids, glucose, and fructose; Neither strain utilized free sulfide; however, both strains grew on black ferrous sulfide (FeS) which was converted to ferric iron and sulfate. Strains L7 and SW2 grown photoheterotrophically without ferrous iron were purple to brownish red and yellowish brown, respectively; absorption spectra revealed peaks characteristic of bacteriochlorophyll a. The closest phototrophic relatives of strains L7 and SW2 so far examined on the basis of 16S rRNA sequences were species of the genera Chromatium (gamma subclass of proteobacteria) and Rhodobacter (alpha subclass), respectively. In mineral medium, the new isolates formed 7.6 g of cell dry mass per mol of Fe(II) oxidized, which is in good agreement with a photoautotrophic utilization of ferrous iron as electron donor for CO2 fixation. Dependence of ferrous iron oxidation on light and CO2 was also demonstrated in dense cell suspensions. In media containing both ferrous iron and an organic substrate (e.g., acetate, glucose), strain L7 utilized ferrous iron and the organic compound simultaneously; in contrast, strain SW2 started to oxidize ferrous iron only after consumption of the organic electron donor. Ferrous iron oxidation by anoxygenic phototrophs is understandable in terms of energetics. In contrast to the Fe3+/Fe2+ pair (E(0) = +0.77 V) existing in acidic solutions, the relevant redox pair at pH 7 in bicarbonate-containing environments, Fe(OH)(3)+HCO3-/FeCO3, has an E(0) of +0.2 V.

The lattice parameter of Co1-xFexSb3 is slightly larger than that of the binary compound CoSb3. The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity are generally reduced by the substitution for Co by Fe. The thermal conductivity is also reduced by the substitution especially at high iron content region.

The source of the metalloids are two tailing impoundments which hold similar to 380,000 m(3) of mining waste. The tailings and the discharged water have circumneutral pH values (7.0 +/- 0.6) because the acidity generated by the decomposition of the primary sulfides (pyrite, FeS2; arsenopyrite, FeAsS; berthierite, FeSb2S4) is rapidly neutralized by the abundant carbonates. The weathering rims on the primary sulfides are iron oxides which act as very efficient scavengers of As and Sb (with up to 19.2 wt% As and 23.7 wt% Sb). In-situ mu-XANES experiments indicate that As in the weathering rims is fully oxidized (As5+). The pore solutions in the impoundment body contain up to 81 ppm As and 2.5 ppm Sb. Once these solutions are discharged from the impoundments, they precipitate or deposit masses of As-rich hydrous ferric oxide (As-HFO) with up to 28.3 wt% As2O5 and 2.7 wt% Sb. All As-HFO samples are amorphous to X-rays. They contain Fe and As in their highest oxidation state and in octahedral and tetrahedral coordination, respectively, as suggested by XANES and EXAFS studies on Fe K and As K edges. The iron octahedra in the As-HFO share edges to form short single chains and the chains polymerize by sharing edges or corners with the adjacent units. The arsenate ions attach to the chains in a bidentate-binuclear and monodentate fashion. In addition, hydrogen-bonded complexes may exist to satisfy the bonding requirements of all oxygen atoms in the first coordination sphere of As5+. Structural changes in the As-HFO samples were traced by chemical analyses and Fe EXAFS spectroscopy during an ageing experiment.. As the samples age, As becomes more easily leachable. EXAFS spectra show a discernible trend of increasing number of Fe-Fe pairs at a distance of 3.3-3.5 angstrom, that is, increasing polymerization of the iron octahedra to form larger units with fewer adsorption sites. Therefore, although ferrihydrite is an excellent material for capturing arsenic, its use as a medium for a long-term storage of As has to be considered with a great caution because it will tend to release arsenic as it ages.

The electrical resistivity of the composite increases with increasing MG time, but it is lower than that of CoSb3 at high temperature. The decrease in the thermal conductivity and the lesser increase in the electrical resistivity are ascribed to the enhancement of phonon scattering caused by the dispersion of FeSb2 particles in the CoSb3 matrix and the low electrical resistivity of FeSb2, respectively. As a result, the composite whose molar ratio of CoSb3 to FeSb2 is 0.7:0.3 and the MG time is 25 h has a maximum figure of merit value of 6.1x10(-4) K-1 at 756 K.

Typical behaviour associated with narrow bands and narrow gaps is only confirmed for the FeSb2 and the FeSb2-xAsx samples. The maximum absolute thermopower of FeSb2 spans from 10 to 45 mV/K at around 10 K, greatly exceeding that of both FeAs2 and RuSb2. The relation between the carrier concentration and the maximum thermopower value is in approximate agreement with theoretical predictions of the electron-diffusion contribution which, however, requires an enhancement factor larger than 30. The isoelectronic substitution leads to a reduction of the thermal conductivity, but the charge-carrier mobility is also largely reduced due to doping-induced crystallographic defects or impurities.

Iron limitation is especially apparent in bacterial pathogens of mammalian hosts where free iron concentrations are physiologically negligible. A common strategy is to secrete low molecular weight iron chelators, termed siderophores, and express high affinity receptors for the siderophore-iron complex. Staphylococcus aureus, a widespread pathogen, produces two siderophores, staphyloferrin A (SA) and staphyloferrin B (SB). We have determined the crystal structure of the staphyloferrin B receptor, SirA, at high resolution in both the apo and Fe(III)-SB (FeSB)-bound forms. SirA, a member of the class III binding protein family of metal receptors, has N- and C-terminal domains, each composed of mainly a beta-stranded core and alpha-helical periphery. The domains are bridged by a single alpha-helix and together form the FeSB binding site. SB coordinates Fe(III) through five oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom in distorted octahedral geometry. SirA undergoes conformational change upon siderophore binding, largely securing two loops from the C-terminal domain to enclose FeSB with a low nanomolar dissociation constant. The staphyloferrin A receptor, HtsA, homologous to SirA, also encloses its cognate siderophore (FeSA); however, the largest conformational rearrangements involve a different region of the C-terminal domain. FeSB is uniquely situated in the binding pocket of SirA with few of the contacting residues being conserved with those of HtsA interacting with FeSA. Although both SirA and HtsA bind siderophores from the same alpha-hydroxycarboxylate class, the unique structural features of each receptor provides an explanation for their distinct specificity.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "285", "authors": ["Grigg, JC", "Cheung, J", "Heinrichs, DE", "Murphy, MEP"], "issue": "45", "pages": "34579-34588"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ic900784t", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860116614/inocaj-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "DEC 21 2009", "title": "Syntheses, Crystal and Electronic Structures, and Physical Properties of Two Quaternary Chalcogenides: La(4)FeSb(2)Q(10) (Q = S, Se)", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic900784t", "abstract": "Two new quaternary chalcogenides, La4FeSb2S10 and La4FeSb2Se10, have been synthesized from the stoichiometric mixture of elements by solid-state reactions at 1100 degrees C.

The Fe-O stretching vibrations of bound hydroxide, substrates, or inhibitors are not resonance enhanced. However, their influence is detectable in O-18 shifts of FeS modes of the [Fe4S4b]S-3(t) cluster and in the frequency elevation of one of the FeSt modes from ca. 360 to 372 cm(-1). The FeS modes have all been assigned. Their frequencies and S-34(b) shifts are reproduced via normal mode calculations on a cluster model with ethyl thiolate ligands, provided that the FeS-CC dihedral angles are set to the values found in the crystal structures and that allowance is made for FeS force constant differences due to weakening of the bonds to the unique Fe atom, Fe-a, to which OH is attached and strengthening of the bonds to the remaining Fe atoms. The frequencies and isotope shifts are likewise, reproduced for the 3Fe inactive form of aconitase if allowance is made for further strengthening of the bonds to the doubly bridging S atoms, once Fe-a is removed. D2O shifts of 2 cm(-1) are seen for the E symmetry FeSb cluster mode and for an FeSt mode at 358 cm(-1) for aconitase with bound substrate, consistent with the H-bonds to both bridging and terminal S atoms deduced from the crystal structure. In native aconitase, the 360-cm(-1) FeSt band likewise shifts 2 cm(-1) in D2O, and the intensification of this band upon substrate or inhibitor binding indicates an alteration in the excited state of the H-bond interaction with a terminal sulfur atom. In addition, resonance enhancement is observed for amide modes involving C=O stretching (amide I, 1655 cm(-1)) and C-C-N bending (466 cm(-1)), identified via their D2O sensitivity. The 1655-cm(-1) amide I band shifts to 1642 cm(-1) when aconitase is dissolved in D2O, but to 1624 cm(-1) when it is reconstituted from apoprotein in D2O. These shifts are consistent with H/D exchange of one and then both protons on a primary amide.

The enzyme contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster in its active site. Several paramagnetic species are observed in steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic studies. The first signal detected is from a transient species that displays a rhombic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal with g(xyz) = 2.000, 2.019, and 2.087 (FeS(A)).

Through a reiterative process of sequence analysis and reannotation, we identified 149 NBS-LRR-encoding genes in the Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) genomic sequence. Fifty-six of these genes were corrected from earlier annotations. At least 12 are predicted to be pseudogenes. As described previously, two distinct groups of sequences were identified: those that encoded an N-terminal domain with Toll/Interieukin-1 Receptor homology (TIR-NBS-LRR, or TNL), and those that encoded an N-terminal coiled-coil motif (CC-NBS-LRR, or CNL). The encoded proteins are distinct from the 58 predicted adapter proteins in the previously described TIR-X, TIR-NBS, and CC-NBS groups. Classification based on protein domains, intron positions, sequence conservation, and genome distribution defined four subgroups of CNL proteins, eight subgroups of TNL proteins, and a pair of divergent NL proteins that lack a defined N-terminal motif. CNL proteins generally were encoded in single exons, although two subclasses were identified that contained introns in unique positions. TNL proteins were encoded in modular exons, with conserved intron positions separating distinct protein domains. Conserved motifs were identified in the LRRs of both CNL and TNL proteins. In contrast to CNL proteins, TNL proteins contained large and variable C-terminal domains. The extant distribution and diversity of the NBS-LRR sequences has been generated by extensive duplication and ectopic rearrangements that involved segmental duplications as well as microscale events.

Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation. However, p95/nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation.

An increasing number of NBS-encoding sequences are being identified through gene cloning, PCR amplification with degenerate primers, and genome sequencing projects. The NBS domain was analyzed from 14 known plant resistance genes and more than 400 homologs, representing 26 genera of monocotyledonous, dicotyle-donous and one coniferous species. Two distinct groups of diverse sequences were identified, indicating divergence during evolution and an ancient origin for these sequences. One group was comprised of sequences encoding an N-terminal domain with Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor homology (TIR), including the known resistance genes, N, M, L6, RPP1 and RPP5. Surprisingly, this group was entirely absent from monocot species in searches of both random genomic sequences and large collections of ESTs. A second group contained monocot and dicot sequences, including the known resistance genes, RPS2, RPM1, I2, Mi, Dm3, Pi-B, Xa1, RPP8, RPS5 and Prf. Amino acid signatures in the conserved motifs comprising the NBS domain clearly distinguished these two groups. The Arabidopsis genome is estimated to contain approximately 200 genes that encode related NBS motifs; TIR sequences were more abundant and outnumber non-TIR sequences threefold. The Arabidopsis NBS sequences currently in the databases are located in approximately 21 genomic clusters and 14 isolated loci. NBS-encoding sequences may be more prevalent in rice.

It also includes specific tools for extracting data for spectrum synthesis and model atmosphere calculations. The different accuracies of data available in the literature made it necessary to introduce a ranking system and to provide a flexible method for extracting the best possible set of atomic Line parameters for a given transition from all the available sources. The data base is presently restricted to spectral Lines which are relevant for stars in which the LTE approximation is sufficient and molecular lines do not have to be taken into account.

First, we will discuss rational design of synthetic strategies and the synthesis of NWs via vapor phase and chemical growth approaches. Secondly, the vapor-solid process for synthesis of oxide based nanostructures will be described in details. We will illustrate the polar surface dominated growth phenomena, such as the formation of nanosprings, nanorings and nanohelices of single-crystal zinc oxide.

To examine whether 53BP1 has a role in the cellular response to DNA damage, we probed its intracellular localization by immunofluorescence. In untreated primary cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells, 53BP1 exhibited diffuse nuclear staining; whereas, within 5-15 min after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), 53BP1 localized at discreet nuclear foci. We propose that these foci represent sites of processing of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), because they were induced by IR and chemicals that cause DSBs, but not by ultraviolet light; their peak number approximated the number of DSBs induced by IR and decreased over time with kinetics that parallel the rate of DNA repair; and they colocalized with IR-induced Mre11/NBS and gamma -H2AX foci, which have been previously shown to localize at sites of DSBs. Formation of 53BP1 foci after irradiation was not dependent on ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS1), or wild-type p53. Thus, the fast kinetics of 53BP1 focus formation after irradiation and the lack of dependency on ATM and NBS1 suggest that 53BP1 functions early in the cellular response to DNA DSBs.", "ISSN": "0021-9525", "pub": "JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY", "volume": "151", "authors": ["Schultz, LB", "Chehab, NH", "Malikzay, A", "Halazonetis, TD"], "issue": "7", "pages": "1381-1390"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/BF02990451", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF02990451.pdf", "pubDate": "1981", "title": "INFLUENCE OF ASHING TECHNIQUES ON THE ANALYSIS OF TRACE-ELEMENTS IN ANIMAL TISSUE .1.

To accomplish this we generated transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana containing the tobacco N gene.

In humans such insights come mainly from genetic disorders. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) are two distinct, but closely related, single gene disorders that highlight a complex junction of several signal transduction pathways. These pathways appear to control defense mechanisms against specific types of damage to cellular macromolecules, and probably regulate the processing of certain types of DNA damage or normal intermediates of DNA metabolism. A-T is characterized primarily by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, genome instability, clinical radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. NBS shares all these features except cerebellar deterioration. The cellular phenotypes of A-T and NBS are almost indistinguishable, however, and include chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and defects in cell cycle checkpoints normally induced by ionizing radiation. The recent identification of the gene responsible for A-T, ATM, has revealed its product to be a large, constitutively expressed phosphoprotein with a carboxy-terminal region similar to the catalytic domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases). ATM is a member of a family of proteins identified in various organisms, which share the PI 3-kinase domain and are involved in regulation of cell cycle progression and response to genotoxic agents. Some of these proteins, most notably the DNA-dependent protein kinase, have an associated protein kinase activity, and preliminary data indicate this activity in ATM as well. Mutations in A-T patients are null alleles that truncate or destabilize the ATM protein. Atm-deficient mice recapitulate the human phenotype with slower nervous-system degeneration. Two ATM interactors, c-Abl and p53, underscore its role in cellular responses to genotoxic stress. The complexity of ATM's structure and mode of action make it a paradigm of multifaceted signal transduction proteins involved in many physiological pathways via multiple protein-protein interactions, The as yet unknown NBS protein may be a component in an ATM-based complex, with a key role in sensing and processing specific DNA damage or intermediates and signaling their presence to the cell cycle machinery.", "ISSN": "0066-4197", "pub": "ANNUAL REVIEW OF GENETICS", "volume": "31", "authors": ["Shiloh, Y"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "635-662"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0958-1669(03)00035-1", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166903000351/pdfft?md5=99e5171793d88c86324714091fb6484e&pid=1-s2.0-S0958166903000351-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 2003", "title": "Deciphering plant-pathogen communication: fresh perspectives for molecular resistance breeding", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166903000351", "abstract": "Activation of local and systemic plant defences in response to pathogen attack involves dramatic cellular reprogramming.

Them are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 (refs 1,2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (1R) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time(3).

This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro.

These results have suggested a critical role for the NE in immune response and tumor suppression and raised the question of whether PML is crucial for the formation or stability of NE. In addition, PML is, among other proteins, covalently modified by SUMO-1. However, the functional relevance of this modification is unclear. Here, we show in primary PML-/- cells of various histologic origins, that in the absence of PML, several NE proteins such as Sp100, CBP, ISG20, Daxx, and SUMO-1 fail to accumulate in the NE and acquire aberrant localization patterns. Transfection of PML in PML-/- cells causes the relocalization of NE proteins. By contrast, a PML mutant that can no longer be modified by SUMO-1 fairs to do so and displays an aberrant nuclear localization pattern. Therefore, PML is required for the proper formation of the NE.

Here, however, we report that the vast majority of undifferentiated NBs exhibit abnormal cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53. This inability of p53 to translocate to the nucleus presumably prevents the protein from functioning as a suppressor. Thirty of 31 cases (96%) of undifferentiated NE showed elevated levels of wild-type p53 in the cytoplasm of all tumor cells concomittant with a lack of nuclear staining. p53 immunoprecipitation from tumor tissues showed a 4.5- to 8-fold increase over normal protein levels. All of 10 tumors analyzed harbored wild-type p53 by direct sequencing of full-length cDNA and Southern blot. In addition, no MDM-2 gene amplification was seen in all 11 tumors analyzed. In contrast, no p53 abnormality was detected in 14 differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas and 1 benign ganglioneuroma. We conclude that loss of p53 function seems to play a major role in the tumorigenesis of undifferentiated NE. This tumor might abrogate the transactivating function of p53 by inhibiting its access to the nucleus, rather than by gene mutation.

The narrow range in isotopic composition is in contrast to the wide range in boron concentrations of these samples (10.9-71.4 ppm).

PML is conjugated by the ubiquitin-related peptide SUMO-1, a process enhanced by AS(2)O(3) and proposed to target PML to the nuclear matrix.

The Werner syndrome gene (WRN) helicase, another member of the RecQ family like BLM, has very recently been found to help mediate homologous recombination. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically complex chromosomal instability disorder involving seven or more genes, one of which is BRCA2. FA may be at least partially caused by the aberrant production of reactive oxidative species. The breast cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are strongly implicated in HRR; BRCA2 associates with Rad51 and appears to regulate its activity. We discuss in detail the phenotypes of the various mutant cell lines and the signaling pathways mediated by the ATM kinase. ATM's phosphorylation targets can be grouped into oxidative stress-mediated transcriptional changes, cell cycle checkpoints, and recombinational repair. We present the DNA damage response pathways by using the DSB as the prototype lesion, whose incorrect repair can initiate and augment karyotypic abnormalities.

They are termed NBS-LRR proteins. The LRRs of a wide variety of proteins from many organisms serve as protein interaction platforms, and as regulatory modules of protein activation. Genetically, the LRRs of plant R proteins are determinants of response specificity, and their action can lead to plant cell death in the form of the familiar hypersensitive response (HR). A total of 149 R genes are potentially expressed in the Arabidopsis genome, and plant cells must deal with the difficult task of assembling many of the proteins encoded by these genes into functional signaling complexes. Eukaryotic cells utilize several strategies to deal with this problem. First, proteins are spatially restricted to their sub-cellular site of function, thus improving the probability that they will interact with their proper partners. Second, these interactions are architecturally organized to avoid inappropriate signaling events and to maintain the fidelity and efficiency of the response when it is initiated. Recent results provide new insights into how the signaling potential of R proteins might be created, managed and held in check until specific stimulation following infection.

Here, we have biochemically confirmed the observation that splicing regulation of the inhibitory GABA, receptor gamma2 (GABA(A)Rgamma(2)) subunit pre-mRNA exon E9 is disrupted in mice lacking Nova-1. To elucidate the mechanism by which Nova-1 regulates GABA(A)Rgamma2 alternative splicing, we systematically screened mini-genes derived from the GABA(A)Rgamma2 and human R-globin genes for their ability to support Nova-dependent splicing in transient transfection assays. These studies demonstrate that Nova-1 acts directly on GABA(A)Rgamma2 pre-mRNA to regulate E9 splicing and identify an intronic region that is necessary and sufficient for Nova-dependent enhancement of exon inclusion, which we term the NISE (Nova-dependent intronic splicing enhancer) element. The NISE element (located 80 nucleotides upstream of the splice acceptor site of the downstream exon E10) is composed of repeats of the sequence YCAY, consistent with previous studies of the mechanism by which Nova binds RNA. Mutation of these repeats abolishes binding of Nova-1 to the RNA in vitro and Nova-dependent splicing regulation in vivo.

This dynamics can reveal chemical and physical processes that take place on the femto- and picosecond time scale, which is faster than the time scale that may be probed by, for example, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A large number of chemically relevant processes take place on this time scale. Such processes range from forming and breaking hydrogen bonds and proton transfer to solvent exchange and vibrational population transfer.\n\nIn typical 2DIR spectra, multiple processes contribute to the waiting time dynamics and the spectra are often congested. This makes the spectra challenging to interpret, and the aid of theoretical models and simulations is often needed. To be useful, such models need to account for all dynamical processes in the sample simultaneously. The numerical integration of the Schrodinger equation (NISE) method has proven to allow for a very general treatment of the dynamical processes. It accounts for both the motional narrowing resulting from solvent-induced frequency fluctuations and population transfer between coupled vibrations. At the same time, frequency shifts arising from chemical-exchange reactions and changes of the transition dipoles because of either non-Condon effects or molecular reorientation are included in the treatment. This method therefore allows for the disentanglement of all of these processes.\n\nThe NISE method has thus far been successfully applied to study chemical-exchange processes. It was demonstrated that 2DIR is not only sensitive to reaction kinetics but also to the more detailed reaction dynamics. NISE has also been applied to the study of population transfer within the amide I band (Co stretch) and between the amide I and amide 11 bands (CN stretch and NH bend) in polypeptides. From the amide I studies, it was found that the population transfer can be used to enhance cross-peaks that act as structural markers for beta-sheet structure in proteins. From the amide I/II investigation, it was found that the amide II band and the hydrogen-bond stretch vibration are important parts of the relaxation pathway for the amide I vibration. With the development of simple approximations, it becomes possible to apply the NISE method even to very big systems, such as the OH stretch of bulk water, which can only be described well when large numbers of coupled vibrations are taken into account.", "ISSN": "0001-4842", "pub": "ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH", "volume": "42", "authors": ["Jansen, TLC", "Knoester, J"], "issue": "9", "pages": "1405-1411"}, {"DOI": "10.3891/acta.chem.scand.10-1440", "pdflink": "http://actachemscand.org/pdf/acta_vol_10_p1440-1454.pdf", "pubDate": "1956", "title": "X-RAY AND MAGNETIC STUDY OF NICKEL SELENIDES IN THE RANGE NISE TO NISE2", "DOIlink": "http://actachemscand.org/doi/10.3891/acta.chem.scand.10-1440", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0904-213X", "pub": "ACTA CHEMICA SCANDINAVICA", "volume": "10", "authors": ["GRONVOLD, F", "JACOBSEN, E"], "issue": "9", "pages": "1440-1454"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/c2cc38621f", "pdflink": "http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/cc/c2/c2cc38621f/c2cc38621f.pdf", "pubDate": "2013", "title": "NiSe2 as an efficient electrocatalyst for a Pt-free counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2013/CC/c2cc38621f", "abstract": "Nickel diselenide (NiSe2) has been synthesized and applied as a counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time, which displays remarkable catalytic activity in the reduction of I-3(-).

These statistics are obtained using validated, high quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface albedo (MOD43B3) data flagged as snow in the associated Quality Assurance (QA) fields. Near Real-Time Ice and Snow Extent (NISE) data are used as an additional discriminator of snow extent.

This indicates that winter canopy and the underlying surface radiative properties are impacted by the presence of snow overlying these surfaces. For example, the 0.47 mu m albedo of winter snow-free evergreen needleleaf forests increases from 0.03 to 0.36 in the presence of snow, compared to an increase of 0.04 to 0.76 for croplands. In general, the albedo of snow-covered ecosystems with some winter canopy has lower albedos than ecosystems with little to no winter canopy; for example the 0.47 mu m albedo of snow-covered mixed forests is 0.39 compared to 0.87 for barren/deserts and 0.95 for permanent snow.\n\nThese statistics can be used within land surface models in a stand-alone mode, to prescribe albedo values in atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs), or be incorporated into research and operational projects. They are intended to provide researchers with representative spectral albedo values of IGBP ecosystems in the presence of snow that are derived from validated satellite data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The existence of numerous alternative, non-homologous enzyme isoforms presents an interesting evolutionary problem; it also complicates genome-based reconstruction of the metabolic pathways in a variety of organisms. In 1998, a systematic search for analogous enzymes resulted in the identification of 105 Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers that included two or more proteins without detectable sequence similarity to each other, including 34 EC nodes where proteins were known (or predicted) to have distinct structural folds, indicating independent evolutionary origins. In the past 12 years, many putative non-homologous isofunctional enzymes were identified in newly sequenced genomes. In addition, efforts in structural genomics resulted in a vastly improved structural coverage of proteomes, providing for definitive assessment of (non) homologous relationships between proteins.\n\nResults: We report the results of a comprehensive search for non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISE) that yielded 185 EC nodes with two or more experimentally characterized - or predicted - structurally unrelated proteins. Of these NISE sets, only 74 were from the original 1998 list. Structural assignments of the NISE show over-representation of proteins with the TIM barrel fold and the nucleotide-binding Rossmann fold. From the functional perspective, the set of NISE is enriched in hydrolases, particularly carbohydrate hydrolases, and in enzymes involved in defense against oxidative stress.\n\nConclusions: These results indicate that at least some of the non-homologous isofunctional enzymes were recruited relatively recently from enzyme families that are active against related substrates and are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in substrate specificity.\n\nReviewers: This article was reviewed by Andrei Osterman, Keith F.

The goal of this paper is to perform such tasks in a distributed fashion, using data collected at power-limited sensors which either communicate with a fusion center (FC) over noisy links, or, communicate with each other over nonideal channels in an ad hoc setting. In FC-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with a prescribed power budget, linear dimensionality reducing operators which account for the sensor-to-FC channel are derived per sensor to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of Kalman filtered state estimates formed at the FC. Using these operators and state predictions fed back from the FC online, sensors reduce the dimensionality of their local innovation sequences and communicate them to the FC where tracking estimates are corrected. Analytical and numerical results advocate that the novel channel-aware distributed tracker outperforms competing alternatives. In ad hoc WSNs deployed to perform distributed tracking, one sensor broadcasts reduced-dimensionality data per time slot, according to a prespecified transmission order. The dimensionality reducing operators employed by the broadcasting sensor are selected to meet its transmit-power budget, while minimizing the state estimation MSE of the sensor with the lowest receiving SNR. Based on the received reduced-dimensionality data from the broadcasting sensor, every sensor in range performs the NISE optimal tracking. Corroborating distributed target tracking simulations based on distance-only observations illustrate that the novel scheme provides sensors with accurate estimates at affordable communication cost.", "ISSN": "1053-587X", "pub": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING", "volume": "57", "authors": ["Zhu, H", "Schizas, ID", "Giannakis, GB"], "issue": "8", "pages": "3193-3207"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00934-0", "pdflink": "http://dx.doi.org/content/231/1/85.full-text.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 9 2004", "title": "Distribution of the NisI immunity protein and enhancement of nisin activity by the lipid-free NisI", "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00934-0", "abstract": "Lactococcus lactis cells producing the antibacterial peptide nisin protect their own cytoplasmic membrane by specific immunity proteins, NisI and NisF/E/G.

Limited data have suggested that sleep-disordered breathing, a condition of repeated episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep, is prevalent among adults. Data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of the natural history of cardiopulmonary disorders of sleep, were used to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing among adults and address its importance to the public health.\n\nMethods. A random sample of 602 employed men and women 30 to 60 years old were studied by overnight polysomnography to determine the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep (the apnea-hypopnea score). We measured the age- and sex-specific prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in this group using three cutoff points for the apnea-hypopnea score (greater-than-or-equal-to 5, greater-than-or-equal-to 10, and greater-than-or-equal-to 15); we used logistic regression to investigate risk factors.\n\nResults. The estimated prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, defined as an apnea-hypopnea score of 5 or higher, was 9 percent for women and 24 percent for men We estimated that 2 percent of women and 4 percent of men in the middle-aged work force meet the minimal diagnostic criteria for the sleep apnea syndrome (an apnea-hypopnea score of 5 or higher and daytime hypersomnolence). Male sex and obesity were strongly associated with the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Habitual snorers, both men and women, tended to have a higher prevalence of apnea-hypopnea scores of 15 or higher.\n\nConclusions. The prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing is high among men and is much higher than previously suspected among women.

The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5degrees latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration.

Approximately 147,000 patients throughout the world have received infliximab. Excess TNF-(alpha) in association with tuberculosis may cause weight loss and night sweats, yet in animal models it has a protective role in the host response to tuberculosis. There is no direct evidence of a protective role of TNF-(alpha) in patients with tuberculosis.\n\nMethods: We analyzed all reports of tuberculosis after infliximab therapy that had been received as of May 29, 2001, through the MedWatch spontaneous reporting system of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults: There were 70 reported cases of tuberculosis after treatment with infliximab for a median of 12 weeks. In 48 patients, tuberculosis developed after three or fewer infusions. Forty of the patients had extrapulmonary disease (17 had disseminated disease, 11 lymph-node disease, 4 peritoneal disease, 2 pleural disease, and 1 each meningeal, enteric, paravertebral, bone, genital, and bladder disease). The diagnosis was confirmed by a biopsy in 33 patients. Of the 70 reports, 64 were from countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis. The reported frequency of tuberculosis in association with infliximab therapy was much higher than the reported frequency of other opportunistic infections associated with this drug. In addition, the rate of reported cases of tuberculosis among patients treated with infliximab was higher than the available background rates.\n\nConclusions: Active tuberculosis may develop soon after the initiation of treatment with infliximab. Before prescribing the drug, physicians should screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection or disease. (N Engl J Med 2001;345:1098-104.)

Similar to animals that lack expression of either Ctla-4 (refs, 5,6) or Tgf-beta (refs, 7,8), the pathology observed in sf mice seems to result from an inability to properly regulate CD4+CD8- T-cell activity(3,9).

Prevalence of white coat hypertension, defined by an average daytime ambulatory blood pressure lower than 131/86 mmHg in women and 136/87 mmHg in men in clinically hypertensive subjects, was 19.2%.

There were no intra- or postoperative complications and 63 patients (84%) were completely cured throughout the 2-year follow-up period. Six patients (8%) were significantly improved, i.e. they did not loose urine apart from an occasional leakage during severe cold etc. In the remaining 6 patients (8%) no improvement was seen. These failures were obvious at the first postoperative check-up after 2 months. Thus, there were no relapses after 2 months. All but 5 patients were able to void properly directly after surgery. These 5 needed an indwelling catheter during the night directly after the operation. All 75 patients were released from the hospital the same day or the day after surgery without catheterization. Mean sick leave was 10 days and mean operation time 22 minutes. No defect healing or rejection of the sling occurred.

Recently, the mouse ob gene(2), and subsequently its human and rat homologues(2-6), have been cloned. The ob gene product, leptin(7), is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue, and appears to be a signalling factor regulating body-weight homeostasis and energy balance(2,7-9). Because the level of ob gene expression might indicate the size of the adipose depot, we suggest that it is regulated by factors modulating adipose tissue size. Here we show that ob gene exhibits diurnal variation, increasing during the night, after rats start eating. This variation was linked to changes in food intake, as fasting prevented the cyclic variation and decreased ob messenger RNA. Furthermore, refeeding fasted rats restored ob mRNA within 4 hours to levels of fed animals. A single insulin injection in fasted animals increased ob mRNA to levels of fed controls. Experiments to control glucose and insulin independently in animals, and studies in primary adipocytes, showed that insulin regulates ob gene expression directly in rats, regardless of its glucose-lowering effects. Whereas the ob gene product, leptin, has been shown to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure(7-9) our data demonstrate that ob gene expression is increased after food ingestion in rats, perhaps through a direct action of insulin on the adipocyte.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "377", "authors": ["SALADIN, R", "DEVOS, P", "GUERREMILLO, M", "LETURQUE, A", "GIRARD, J", "STAELS, B", "AUWERX, J"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v377/n6549/abs/377527a0.html", "issue": "6549", "pages": "527-529"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 1990", "title": "CIRCADIAN BLOOD-PRESSURE CHANGES AND LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY IN ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0009-7322", "pub": "CIRCULATION", "volume": "81", "authors": ["VERDECCHIA, P", "SCHILLACI, G", "GUERRIERI, M", "GATTESCHI, C", "BENEMIO, G", "BOLDRINI, F", "PORCELLATI, C"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "2", "pages": "528-536"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 2001", "title": "A meta-analysis of the response of soil respiration, net nitrogen mineralization, and aboveground plant growth to experimental ecosystem warming", "abstract": "Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the mean global temperature by 1.0-3.5 degreesC in the next 50-100 years. The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive nighttime warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming, results from the meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2-9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3-6.0 degreesC significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20% (with a 95% confidence interval of 18-22%), net N mineralization rates by 46% (with a 95% confidence interval of 30-64%). and plant productivity by 19% (with a 95% confidence interval of 15-23%). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture, site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we should be cautious in \"scaling up\" responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level.

The auscultatory technique with a trained observer and mercury sphygmomanometer continues to be the method of choice for measurement in the office, using the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds, including in pregnant women. The use of mercury is declining, and alternatives are needed. Aneroid devices are suitable, but they require frequent calibration. Hybrid devices that use electronic transducers instead of mercury have promise. The oscillometric method can be used for office measurement, but only devices independently validated according to standard protocols should be used, and individual calibration is recommended. They have the advantage of being able to take multiple measurements. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are all essential. It is increasingly recognized that office measurements correlate poorly with blood pressure measured in other settings, and that they can be supplemented by self-measured readings taken with validated devices at home. There is increasing evidence that home readings predict cardiovascular events and are particularly useful for monitoring the effects of treatment. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring gives a better prediction of risk than office measurements and is useful for diagnosing white-coat hypertension.

Two decades ago, the method was employed to study CO2 exchange of agricultural crops under ideal conditions during short field campaigns. During the past decade the eddy covariance method has emerged as an important tool for evaluating fluxes of carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere over the course of a year, and more. At present, the method is being applied in a nearly continuous mode to study carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange at over a hundred and eighty field sites, worldwide. The objective of this review is to assess the eddy covariance method as it is being applied by the global change community on increasingly longer time scales and over less than ideal surfaces.\n\nThe eddy covariance method is most accurate when the atmospheric conditions (wind, temperature, humidity, CO2 ) are steady, the underlying vegetation is homogeneous and it is situated on flat terrain for an extended distance upwind. When the eddy covariance method is applied over natural and complex landscapes or during atmospheric conditions that vary with time, the quantification of CO2 exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere must include measurements of atmospheric storage, flux divergence and advection.\n\nAveraging CO2 flux measurements over long periods (days to year) reduces random sampling error to relatively small values. Unfortunately, data gaps are inevitable when constructing long data records. Data gaps are generally filled with values produced from statistical and empirical models to produce daily and annual sums of CO2 exchange. Filling data gaps with empirical estimates do not introduce significant bias errors because the empirical algorithms are derived from large statistical populations. On the other hand, flux measurement errors can be biased at night when winds are light and intermittent. Nighttime bias errors tend to produce an underestimate in the measurement of ecosystem respiration.\n\nDespite the sources of errors associated with long-term eddy flux measurements, many investigators are producing defensible estimates of annual carbon exchange. When measurements come from nearly ideal sites the error bound on the net annual exchange of CO2 is less than +/-50 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Additional confidence in long-term measurements is growing because investigators are producing values of net ecosystem productivity that are converging with independent values produced by measuring changes in biomass and soil carbon, as long as the biomass inventory studies are conducted over multiple years.", "ISSN": "1354-1013", "pub": "GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY", "volume": "9", "authors": ["Baldocchi, DD"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00629.x/abstract;jsessionid=66095780B99333151661309E69BD5B71.f02t02", "issue": "4", "pages": "479-492"}, {"DOI": "10.1001/jama.282.6.539", "pdflink": "http://jamanetwork.com/data/pdfs/ads/adPrinciples.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 11 1999", "title": "Predicting cardiovascular risk using conventional vs ambulatory blood pressure in older patients with systolic hypertension", "abstract": "Context The clinical use of ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring requires further validation in prospective outcome studies.\n\nObjective To compare the prognostic significance of conventional and ambulatory BP measurement in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.\n\nDesign Substudy to the double-blind placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial, started in October 1988 with follow up to February 1999.

The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days.\n\nSetting: Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring.\n\nParticipants: A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments.\n\nInterventions: Nocturnal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited.\n\nResults: Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and delta power in the non-REM sleep EEG-a putative marker of sleep homeostasis-displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h).\n\nConclusions: Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions, This suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological \"cost\" which accumulates over time.", "ISSN": "0161-8105", "pub": "SLEEP", "volume": "26", "authors": ["Van Dongen, HPA", "Maislin, G", "Mullington, JM", "Dinges, DF"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "2", "pages": "117-126"}, {"DOI": "10.1126/science.1158899", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "SEP 12 2008", "title": "Cooling, heating, generating power, and recovering waste heat with thermoelectric systems", "abstract": "Thermoelectric materials are solid- state energy converters whose combination of thermal, electrical, and semiconducting properties allows them to be used to convert waste heat into electricity or electrical power directly into cooling and heating.

Comparisons of net ecosystem exchange (F-NEE) responses are being made among biome types, phenology patterns, and stress conditions. The comparisons are usually performed on annual sums of F-NEE; however, the average data coverage during a year is only 65%. Therefore, robust and consistent gap filling methods are required.\n\nWe review several methods of gap filling and apply them to data sets available from the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux databases. The methods are based on mean diurnal variation (MDV), look-up tables LookUp, and nonlinear regressions (Regr.), and the impact of different gap filling methods on the annual sum of FNEE is investigated. The difference between annual F-NEE filled by MDV compared to F-NEE filled by Regr. ranged from -45 to +200 g C m(-2) per year (MDV-Regr.). Comparing LookUp and Regr. methods resulted in a difference (LookUp-Regr.) ranging from -30 to +150g Cm-2 per year.\n\nWe also investigated the impact of replacing measurements at night, when turbulent mixing is insufficient. The nighttime correction for low friction velocities (u(*)) shifted annual F-NEE on average by +77 g C m(-2) per year, but in certain cases as much as +185 g C m-2 per year.\n\nOur results emphasize the need to standardize gap filling-methods for improving the comparability of flux data products from regional and global flux networks.

Subjects slept in the laboratory, and sleep and waking were monitored by staff and actigraphy. Three times each day (1000, 1600, and 2200 hours) subjects were assessed for subjective sleepiness (SSS) and mood (POMS) and were evaluated on a brief performance battery that included psychomotor vigilance (PVT), probed memory (PRM), and serial-addition testing. Once each day they completed a series of visual analog scales (VAS) and reported sleepiness and somatic and cognitive/emotional problems. Sleep restriction resulted in statistically robust cumulative effects on waking functions. SSS ratings, subscale scores for fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance from the POMS and VAS ratings of mental exhaustion and stress were elevated across days of restricted sleep (p = 0.009 to p = 0.0001). PVT performance parameters, including the frequency and duration of lapses, were also significantly increased by restriction (p = 0.018 to p = 0.0001). Significant time-of-day effects were evident in SSS and PVT data, but time-of-day did not interact with the effects of sleep restriction across days. The temporal profiles of cumulative changes in neurobehavioral measures of alertness as a function of sleep restriction were generally consistent. Subjective changes tended to precede performance changes by 1 day, but overall changes in both classes of measure were greatest during the first 2 days (P1, P2) and last 2 days (P6, P7) of sleep restriction. Data from subsets of subjects also showed: 1) that significant decreases in the MSLT occurred during sleep restriction, 2) that the elevated sleepiness and performance deficits continued beyond day 7 of restriction, and 3) that recovery from these deficits appeared to require two full nights of sleep. The cumulative increase in performance lapses across days of sleep restriction correlated closely with MSLT results (r = -0.95) from an earlier comparable experiment by Carskadon and Dement (1).

By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951-2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901-2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901-1950, 1951-1978 and 1979-2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November.

Motif-X (motif extractor) analysis of the phosphorylation sites in chloroplast proteins identified four significantly enriched kinase motifs, which include casein kinase II (CKII) and proline-directed kinase motifs, as well as two new motifs at the carboxyl terminus of ribosomal proteins. Using the phosphorylation motifs as a footprint for the activity of a specific kinase class, we connected the phosphoproteins with their putative kinases and constructed a chloroplast CKII phosphorylation network. The network topology suggests that CKII is a central regulator of different chloroplast functions. To provide insights into the dynamic regulation of protein phosphorylation, we analyzed the phosphoproteome at the end of day and end of night. The results revealed only minor changes in chloroplast kinase activities and phosphorylation site utilization. A notable exception was ATP synthase beta-subunit, which is found phosphorylated at CKII phosphorylation sites preferentially in the dark.

Immediate hypersensitivity to cockroach, house-dust-mite, and cat allergens was measured by skin testing. We then measured major allergens of cockroach (Bla g 1), dust mites (Der p 1 and Der f 1), and cat dander (Fel d 1) in household dust using monoclonal-antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. High levels of exposure were defined according to proposed thresholds for causing disease. Data on morbidity due to asthma were collected at base line and over a one-year period.\n\nResults Of the children, 36.8 percent were allergic to cockroach allergen, 34.9 percent to dust-mite allergen, and 22.7 percent to cat allergen. Among the children's bedrooms, 50.2 percent had high levels of cockroach allergen in dust, 9.7 percent had high levels of dust-mite allergen, and 12.6 percent had high levels of cat allergen. After we adjusted for sex, score on the Child Behavior Checklist, and family history of asthma, we found that children who were both allergic to cockroach allergen and exposed to high levels of this allergen had 0.37 hospitalization a year, as compared with 0.11 for the other children (P=0.001), and 2.56 unscheduled medical visits for asthma per year, as compared with 1.43 (P<0.001). They also had significantly more days of wheezing, missed school days, and nights with lost sleep, and their parents or other care givers were awakened during the night and changed their daytime plans because of the child's asthma significantly more frequently. Similar patterns were not found for the combination of allergy to dust mites or cat dander and high levels of the allergen.\n\nConclusions The combination of cockroach allergy and exposure to high levels of this allergen may help explain the frequency of asthma-related health problems in inner-city children.

Combined results from all three stresses identified 2,409 genes with a greater than 2-fold change over control. This suggests that about 30% of the transcriptome is sensitive to regulation by common stress conditions. The majority of changes were stimulus specific. At the 3-h time point, less than 5% (118 genes) of the changes were observed as shared by all three stress responses. By 27 h, the number of shared responses was reduced more than 10-fold (< 0.5%), consistent with a progression toward more stimulus-specific responses. Roots and leaves displayed very different changes. For example, less than 14% of the cold-specific changes were shared between root and leaves at both 3 and 27 h. The gene with the largest induction under all three stress treatments was At5g52310 (LT1/COR78), with induction levels in roots greater than 250-fold for cold, 40-fold for mannitol, and 57-fold for NaCl. A stress response was observed for 306 (68%) of the known circadian controlled genes, supporting the hypothesis that an important function of the circadian clock is to \"anticipate\" predictable stresses such as cold nights.

Persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with the recurrence of duodenal ulcer. Whether the efficacy of bismuth therapy in reducing the rate of recurrence of duodenal ulcer is due to its antimicrobial effects on H. pylori or to a direct protective action on the mucosa is still a matter of debate.\n\nMethods. To study the effect of the eradication of H. pylori on the recurrence of duodenal ulcer, we treated 104 patients with H. pylori infection and recurrent duodenal ulcer with either amoxicillin (750 mg three times daily) plus metronidazole (500 mg three times daily) or identical-appearing placebos, given orally for 12 days. All patients also received ranitidine (300 mg each night) for 6 or 10 weeks. Endoscopy was performed before treatment and periodically during follow-up for up to 12 months after healing.\n\nResults. Among the 52 patients given antibiotics, H. pylori was eradicated in 46, as compared with 1 of the 52 given placebo (89 percent vs. 2 percent, P<0.001).

In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night-time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long-term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems.\n\nWe show that the temperature sensitivity of R-eco, derived from long-term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short-term temperature sensitivity that is effective when extrapolating from night- to daytime. Specifically, in summer active ecosystems the long-term temperature sensitivity exceeds the short-term sensitivity. Thus, in those ecosystems, the application of a long-term temperature sensitivity to the extrapolation of respiration from night to day leads to a systematic overestimation of ecosystem respiration from half-hourly to annual time-scales, which can reach > 25% for an annual budget and which consequently affects estimates of GEP. Conversely, in summer passive (Mediterranean) ecosystems, the long-term temperature sensitivity is lower than the short-term temperature sensitivity resulting in underestimation of annual sums of respiration.\n\nWe introduce a new generic algorithm that derives a short-term temperature sensitivity of R-eco from eddy covariance data that applies this to the extrapolation from night- to daytime, and that further performs a filling of data gaps that exploits both, the covariance between fluxes and meteorological drivers and the temporal structure of the fluxes. While this algorithm should give less biased estimates of GEP and R-eco, we discuss the remaining biases and recommend that eddy covariance measurements are still backed by ancillary flux measurements that can reduce the uncertainties inherent in the eddy covariance data.", "ISSN": "1354-1013", "pub": "GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY", "volume": "11", "authors": ["Reichstein, M", "Falge, E", "Baldocchi, D", "Papale, D", "Aubinet, M", "Berbigier, P", "Bernhofer, C", "Buchmann, N", "Gilmanov, T", "Granier, A", "Grunwald, T", "Havrankova, K", "Ilvesniemi, H", "Janous, D", "Knohl, A", "Laurila, T", "Lohila, A", "Loustau, D", "Matteucci, G", "Meyers, T", "Miglietta, F", "Ourcival, JM", "Pumpanen, J", "Rambal, S", "Rotenberg, E", "Sanz, M", "Tenhunen, J", "Seufert, G", "Vaccari, F", "Vesala, T", "Yakir, D", "Valentini, R"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001002.x/abstract;jsessionid=954DE25A71B2F0530B8C323A5F07F288.f04t04", "issue": "9", "pages": "1424-1439"}]], [{"formation_energy_per_atom": -0.8210093140476191, "band_gap": 0.0, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

The location of human MT in the present fMRI results is consistent with that of MT in earlier PET and anatomical studies.\n\nIn addition we found that area MT has a much higher contrast sensitivity than that in several other areas, including primary visual cortex (V1). Functional MRI half-amplitudes in V1 and MT occurred at approximately 15% and 1% luminance contrast, respectively. High sensitivity to contrast and motion in MT have been closely associated with magnocellular stream specialization in nonhuman primates,\n\nHuman psychophysics indicates that visual motion appears to diminish when moving color-varying stimuli are equated in luminance. Electrophysiological results from macaque MT suggest that the human percept could be due to decreases in firing of area MT cells at equiluminance. We show here that fMRI activity in human MT does in fact decrease at and near individually measured equiluminance.\n\nTests with visuotopically restricted stimuli in each hemifield produced spatial variations in fMRI activity consistent with retinotopy in human homologs of macaque areas V1, V2, V3, and VP.

It is restricted in its usage of T cell receptor (TCR) VP genes to V(beta)8, V(beta)7, and V(beta)2. Its surface phenotype is that of activated/memory cells. It carries the natural killer NK1.1 surface marker. Furthermore, though it consists entirely of CD4(+) and CD4(-)8(-) cells, its selection in the thymus depends solely upon major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression by cells of hematopoietic origin. Forced persistence of CD8, in fact, imparts negative selection. Here, we have studied the TCR repertoire of this subset and found that, whereas the beta chain V-D-J junctions are quite variable, a single invariant ct chain V(alpha)14-J281 is used by a majority of the TCRs. This surprisingly restricted usage of the V(alpha)14-J281 a! chain is dependent on MHC class I expression, but independent of the MHC haplotype. In humans, a similar unusual population including CD4(-)8(-) cells can also be found that uses a strikingly homologous, invariant alpha chain V(alpha)24-JQ. Thus, this unique V-alpha-J(alpha) combination has been conserved in both species, conferring specificity to some shared nonpolymorphic MHC class I/peptide self-ligand(s).

A synthesis of the extensive literature data on physicochemical properties, partitioning behavior, abiotic and biotic transformations and bioaccumulation processes of these chemicals is presented. This chemical class exhibits an eight order of magnitude increase in octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow) and a four order of magnitude decrease in vapor pressure (VP) as alkyl chain length increases from 1 to 13 carbons. A critical review of water solubility measurements for higher molecular weight phthalate ester; (i.e. alkyl chains greater than or equal to 6 carbons) reveals that most published values exceed true water solubilities due to experimental difficulties associated with solubility determinations for these hydrophobic organic liquids. Laboratory and field studies show that partitioning to suspended solids, soils, sediments and aerosols increase as K-ow increases and VP decreases. Photodegradation via free radical attack is expected to be the dominant degradation pathway in the atmosphere with predicted half-lives of ca. 1 day for most of the phthalate esters investigated. Numerous studies indicate that phthalate esters are degraded by a wide range of bacteria and actinomycetes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Standardized aerobic biodegradation tests with sewage sludge inocula show that phthalate esters undergo greater than or equal to 50% ultimate degradation within 28 days. Biodegradation is expected to be the dominant loss mechanism in surface waters, soils and sediments. Primary degradation half-lives in surface and marine waters range from <1 day to 2 weeks and in soils from <1 week to several months. Longer half-lives may occur in anaerobic, oligotrophic, or cold environments. Numerous experiments have shown that the bioaccumulation of phthalate esters in the aquatic and terrestrial foodchain is limited by biotransformation, which increases with increasing trophic level. Consequently, models that ignore biotransformation grossly exaggerate bioaccumulation potential of higher molecular weight phthalate esters. This review provides the logical first step in elucidating multimedia exposure to phthalate esters.

We designed a randomized trial to compare survival for patients treated with this preoperative chemoradiation regimen versus surgery alone.\n\nMaterials and Methods: One hundred patients with esophageal carcinoma were randomized to receive either surgery alone (arm I) or preoperative chemoradiation (arm II) with cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 5 and 17 through 21, fluorouracil 300 mg/ m(2)/d on days 1 through 21, and vinblastine 1 mg/ m(2)/d on days 1 through 4 and 17 through 20. Radiotherapy consisted of 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily, Monday through Friday over 21 days, to a total dose of 45 Gy. Transhiatal esophagectomy with a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed on approximately day 42.\n\nResults: At median follow-vp of 8.2 years, there is no significant difference in survival between the treatment arms. Median survival is 17.6 months in arm I and 16.9 months in arm II. Survival at 3 years was 16% in arm I and 30% in arm II (P =.15), This study was statistically powered to detect a relatively large increase in median survival from 1 year to 2.2 years, with at least 80% power.\n\nConclusion: This randomized trial of preoperative chemoradiation versus surgery alone for patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma did not demonstrate a statistically significant survival difference.

To achieve expression of the retroviral gag-pol polyprotein, the precise coding sequences for gag-pol were introduced into a vector which utilizes totally nonretroviral signals for gene expression. Because constitutive expression of the VSV-G protein is toxic in 293 cells, we used the tet(R)/VP 16 transactivator and tet(o) minimal promoter system for inducible, tetracycline-regulatable expression of VSV-G. After stable transfection of the 293GPG packaging cell line with the MFG.SnlsLacZ retroviral vector construct, it was possible to readily isolate stable virus-producing cell lines with titers approaching 10(7) colony-forming units/ml. Transient transfection of 293GPG cells using a modified version of MFG.SnlsLacZ, in which the cytomegalovirus IE promoter was used to drive transcription of the proviral genome, led to titers of approximate to 10(6) colony-forming units/ml. The retroviral/VSV-G pseudotypes generated using 293GPG cells were significantly more resistant to human complement than commonly used amphotropic vectors and could be highly concentrated (> 1000-fold). This new packaging cell line may prove to be particularly useful for assessing the potential use of retroviral vectors for direct in vivo gene transfer.

MRP-overexpressing SW-1573 cells are resistant to doxorubicin, daunorubicin, vincristine, VP-16, colchicine, and rhodamine 123, but not to 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide or taxol. The intracellular accumulation of drug (daunorubicin, vincristine, and VP-16) is decreased and the efflux of drug (daunorubicin) is increased in the transfectant.

Twenty-two patients experienced a complete response (55%), 16 patients had a partial response (40%), and two patients, who received no treatment, were classified as nonresponders. Medians for duration of response and time to progression had not been reached after a median observation time of 29 + months, Twenty-eight of 38 assessable patients (74%) continued in remission during this median follow-vp period. The most frequent adverse events attributable to CHOP were alopecia (38 patients), neutropenia (31 patients), and fever (23 patients). The most frequent events attributed to Rituxan were fever and chills, observed primarily with the first infusion. No quantifiable immune response to the chimeric antibody was detected. In a subset of 18 patients, the bcl-2 [t(14;18)] translocation was positive in eight patients; seven of these patients herd complete remissions and converted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity by completion of therapy.\n\nConclusion: This is the first report demonstrating the safety and efficacy of Rituxan anti-CD20 chimeric antibody in combination with standard-dose systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of indolent B-cell lymphoma.

In a recent study, we reported that normal plasma contains a protease activity that cleaves vWF in a shear-dependent manner, causing a decrease in its multimer size while generating dimers of the 140-kD and the 176-kD fragments indistinguishable from those found in normal plasma. In this study, the plasma protease has been partially purified and characterized and the role of vWF conformation in its cleavage by the protease has been further investigated. Guanidine HCl caused unfolding of vWF in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in a shift in its fluorescence emission maxims to longer wavelengths. A dramatic increase in its proteolytic susceptibility was seen at 1.1 to 1.2 mol/L guanidine HCl, a concentration causing only a 3- to 4-nm shift in vWF emission maxima. Although vWF molecules refolded as guanidine HCl was removed by dialysis, the refolding was accompanied only by a partial recovery of the proteolytic resistance. The plasma protease, partially purified by approximately 900 folds by Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration, Matrex gel orange A dye affinity chromatography, and Q Sepharose anion exchange, had a molecular mass of approximately 200 kD and was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, or 1,10-phenanthroline. The inhibition by EGTA or EDTA could be reversed by Ca2+ but not by Mg2+. It was not inhibited by a panel of synthetic and natural protease inhibitors or adsorbed by gelatin-agarose, and it was present in plasmas deficient in proteins involved in coagulation and anticoagulation. The vWF fragments generated by the protease, as mapped by peptide-specific antibodies VP-1 and LJ-7745, were indistinguishable from the natural fragments but distinct from those produced by plasmin. High molecular weight endothelial vWF, after exposure to guanidine HCl or high shear stress, was cleaved by the protease to smaller forms. These results support the model that endothelial secreted vWF is converted to multimers by a novel plasma metalloproteinase. Although native vWF exists in a conformation relatively resistant to cleavage, an alteration in the conformation by shear stress can lead to an enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. This model may explain the decrease in vWF multimer sizes in various clinical conditions.

The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown.\n\nPatients and Methods Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm 3). Primary outcome was overall survival time.\n\nResults The median observation time was 6 years. The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P <. 05). Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64.3%; 95% Cl, 52.1 % to 76.5%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40.7%; 95% Cl, 28.9% to 52.5; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2.1; - 95% Cl, 1.3 to 3.5; P =. 003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12.8% v 3.5%, respectively; P =. 03). Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0.30; 95% Cl, 0.19 to 0.47; P <. 0001).\n\nConclusion Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC.

In the present study, we have examined the transport of leukotriene C-4 (LTC(4)) in membrane vesicles from MRP-transfected HeLa cells (T14), as well as drug-selected H69AR lung cancer cells which express high levels of MRP. V-max and K-m values for LTC(4) transport by membrane vesicles from T14 cells were 529 +/- 176 pmol mg(-1) min(-1) and 105 +/- 31 nM, respectively, At 50 nM LTC(4), the K-m (ATP) was 70 mu M. Transport in T14 vesicles was osmotically-sensitive and was supported by various nucleoside triphosphates but not by non- or slowly-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, LTC, transport rates in membrane vesicles derived from H69AR cells and their parental and revertant variants were consistent with their relative levels of MRP expression. A 190-kDa protein in T14 membrane vesicles was photolabeled by [H-3]LTC(4) and immunoprecipitation with MRP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confirmed that this protein was MRP, LTC, transport was inhibited by an MRP-specific mAb (QCRL-3) directed against an intracellular conformational epitope of MRP, but not by a mAb (QCRL-1) which recognizes a linear epitope, Photolabeling with [H-3]LTC(4) was also inhibitable by mAb QCRL-3 but not mAb &CRL-I, GSH did not inhibit LTC, transport, However, the ability of alkylated GSH derivatives to inhibit transport increased markedly with the length of the alkyl group, S-Decylglutathione was a potent competitive inhibitor of [H-3]LTC(4) transport (K-i(app) 116 nM), suggesting that the two compounds bind to the same, or closely related, site(s) on MRP. Chemotherapeutic agents including colchicine, doxorubicin, and daunoru bicin were poor inhibitors of [H-3]LTC, transport, Taxol, VP-16, vincristine, and vinblastine were also poor inhibitors of LTC, transport but inhibition by these compounds was enhanced by GSH. Uptake of[H-3]vincristine into T14 membrane vesicles in the absence of GSB was low and not dependent on ATP, However, in the presence of GSH, ATP-dependent vincristine transport was observed, Levels of transport increased with concentrations of GSH up to 5 mM. The identification of an MRP-specific mAb that inhibits LTC, transport and prevents photolabeling of MRP by LTC(4), provides conclusive evidence of the ability of MRP to transport cysteinyl leukotrienes, Our studies also demonstrate that MRP is capable of mediating ATP-dependent transport of vincristine and that transport is GSH-dependent.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "271", "authors": ["Loe, DW", "Almquist, KC", "Deeley, RG", "Cole, SPC"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "16", "pages": "9675-9682"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "NOV 1 2001", "title": "The circuitry mediating cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior", "abstract": "The role of limbic-striato-pallidal circuitry in cocaine-induced reinstatement was evaluated.

However, only the VP proved to be necessary for food reinstatement, suggesting that the identified circuit is specific to drug-related reinstatement. Supporting the possibility that the VTA-dPFC-NAcore-VP is a series circuit mediating reinstatement, simultaneous unilateral microinjection of GABA agonists into the dPFC in one hemisphere and into the VP in the contralateral hemisphere abolished cocaine reinstatement. Although dopamine projections from the VTA innervate all three forebrain nuclei, the blockade of dopamine receptors only in the dPFC antagonized cocaine-induced reinstatement. Furthermore, DA administration into the dPFC was sufficient to elicit a reinstatement in drug-related responding.

The estimates are based on sampling of 11,451 individual rock samples over an area of 950,000 km(2), from which 905 large composite samples were prepared and analyzed by thirteen methods. Some of the trace elements (i.e., Ag, As, Ge, Mo, Pd, Pt, Sb, Se, Sn, W) have never been subjected to systematic analysis in previous regional crustal composition studies. The middle, lower, and total crust compositions of the tectonic units are also estimated from studies of exposed crustal cross-sections and granulite xenoliths and by correlation of seismic data from eleven regional seismic refraction profiles with lithologies.\n\nThe proposed granodioritic total crust composition has the following ratios of element pairs exhibiting similar compatibility, that are identical or close to the primitive mantle values: Zr/Hf = 37, Nb/Ta = 17.5, Ba/Th = 87, K/Pb = 0.12 x 10(4), Rb/Cs = 25, Ba/Rb = 8.94, Sn/Sm = 0.31, Se/Cd = 1.64, La/As = 10.3, Ce/Sb = 271, Pb/Bi = 57, Rb/Ti = 177, Er/Ag = 52, Cu/Au = 3.2 x 10(4), Sm/Mo = 7.5, Nd/W = 40, Cl/Li = 10.8, F/Nd = 21.9, acid La/B = 1.8. The mu ((238)U/(204)Pb) value is calculated at similar to 5.\n\nThe upper crust composition is less evolved and higher in TiO(2), total FeO, Co, Cr, Ni, Sc and V, and lower in Na(2)O, K(2)O and No, Ta, Rb, Th, U, and Zr, than previous estimates based on shield samplings. Because usually the uppermost layer of the crust, where mafic volcanics tend to concentrate, has been removed from Precambrian shields, and since our study involves Phanerozoic orogenic belts, the results are suggested to be better representative of the upper crust in a general sense. Trace elements associated with mineralization (e.g., B, Cl, Se, As, Bi, Pd, W, Th, Cs, Ta, Tl, Hg, Au, and Pb) show considerable inter-unit variations by a factor of 2-5 in the upper crust. In addition, the North Qinling paleoactive margin is characterized by anomalous enrichment in Th, U, and Pb in particular and has a marked lower CL value (3.3) compared to the two cratons and the South Qinling paleopassive margin (mu = 4.5-6.2).\n\nEach tectonic unit has a relatively homogenous middle crust composition which is broadly similar to the composition of the total crust. The lower crust in East China can be divided into two layers both seismically and chemically. The upper lower crust is characterized by Vp = 6.7 km s(-1) and an intermediate composition and the lowermost crust by Vp = 7.1 km s(-1) and a mafic composition. The bulk lower crust is still intermediate in composition with 58% SiO(2) due to the dominance of the upper lower crust.\n\nP-wave velocities of both the lower and total crusts in East China are slower by 0.2-0.4 km s(-1) compared to various global estimates. Correspondingly, the total crust shows an more evolved composition and is characterized by a significant negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.80), low Sr/Nd (10.4), and high La/Nb (3.0) ratios. The obtained SiO(2) is 64% on a volatile-free basis. The near arc magma La/Nb ratio implies that intraplate crustal growth contributes <10% of the continental crust. The relative deficits in Eu, Sr, and transition metals (Cr, Ni, Co, V, and Ti) in the derived crustal compositions of East China, along with slower crustal velocity and thin crustal thickness for the Paleozoic to Mesozoic Qinling-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, strongly suggest that lower crust delamination of eclogites, as represented by those from the Dabie-Sulu belt, had played an important role in modification of the East China crust during the Phanerozoic era.

The objective of this study was to identify clinical, lesional and procedural factors that can predict restenosis after coronary stent placement.\n\nBackground. Coronary stent placement reduces the restenosis rate compared with that after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). However, restenosis remains an unresolved issue, and identification of its predictive factors may allow further insight into the underlying process.\n\nMethods. All patients with successful coronary stent placement were eligible for this study unless they had had a major adverse cardiac event during the Ist 30 days after the procedure. Of the 1,349 eligible patients (1,753 lesions), follow-vp angiography at 6 months was performed in 80.4% (1,084 patients, 1,399 lesions). Demographic, clinical, lesional and procedural data were prospectively recorded and analyzed for any predictive power for the occurrence of late restenosis after stenting. Restenosis was evaluated by using three outcomes at follow-up: binary restenosis as a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, late lumen loss as lumen diameter reduction and target lesion revascularization (TLR) as any repeat PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery involving the stented lesion.\n\nResults. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diabetes mellitus, placement of multiple stents and minimal lumen diameter (MLD) immediately after stenting were the strongest predictors of restenosis. Diabetes increased the risk of binary restenosis with an odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] of 1.86 [1.56 to 2.16] and the risk of TLR with an OR of 1.45 [1.11 to 1.80]. Multiple stents increased the risk of binary restenosis with an OR of 1.81 [1.55 to 2.06] and that of TLR with an OR of 1.94 [1.66 to 2.22]. An MLD <3 mm at the end of the procedure augmented the risk of binary restenosis with an OR of 1.81 [1.55 to 2.06] and that of TLR with an OR of 2.05 [1.77 to 2.34]. Classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated that the incidence of restenosis may be as low as 16% for a lesion without any of these risk factors and as high as 59% for a lesion with a combination of these risk factors.\n\nConclusions. Diabetes, multiple stents and smaller final MLD are strong predictors of restenosis after coronary stent placement. Achieving an optimal result with a minimal number of stents during the procedure may significantly reduce this risk even in patients with adverse clinical characteristics such as diabetes.

The transfected cells must also be overinfected with a helper virus, e.g., adenovirus (Ad), which delivers multiple helper functions necessary for rAAV production. Therefore, rAAV stocks produced using these protocols are contaminated with helper adenovirus. The generation of a novel packaging/helper plasmid, pDG, containing all AAV and Ad functions required for amplification and packaging of AAV vector plasmids, is described here. Cotransfection of cells with pDG and an AAV vector plasmid was sufficient for production of infectious rAAV, resulting in helper virus-free rAAV stocks. The rAAV titers obtained using pDG as packaging plasmid were up to Ill-fold higher than those achieved using conventional protocols for rAAV production. Replacement of the AAV-2 p5 promoter by an MMTV-LTR promoter in pDG led to reduced expression of Rep78/68; however, expression of the VP proteins was significantly increased compared with VP levels from standard packaging plasmids. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that the strong accumulation of VP proteins in pDG-transfected cells resulted in enhanced AAV capsid assembly, which is limiting for efficient rAAV production. Furthermore, using a monoclonal antibody highly specific for AAV-2 capsids (A20), an rAAV affinity purification procedure protocol was established. The application of the tools described here led to a significant improvement in recombinant AAV vector production and purification.", "ISSN": "1043-0342", "pub": "HUMAN GENE THERAPY", "volume": "9", "authors": ["Grimm, D", "Kern, A", "Rittner, K", "Kleinschmidt, JA"], "DOIlink": "http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/hum.1998.9.18-2745", "issue": "18", "pages": "2745-2760"}, {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.92.17.7690", "pdflink": "http://www.pnas.org/content/92/17/7690.full.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 15 1995", "title": "ROLE OF GLUTATHIONE IN THE EXPORT OF COMPOUNDS FROM CELLS BY THE MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN", "abstract": "Multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that can confer multidrug resistance (MDR) by lowering intracellular drug concentration.

Glutathione depletion had less effect on MDR in cells transfected with MDR1 cDNA encoding P-glycoprotein and did not increase the passive uptake of daunorubicin by cells, indicating that the decrease of MRP-mediated MDR was not due to nonspecific membrane damage. Glutathione depletion resulted in a decreased efflux of daunorubicin from MRP-transfected cells, but not from MDR1-transfected cells, suggesting that glutathione is specifically required for the export of drugs from cells by MRP.

Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time, we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years.\n\nPatients and Methods: A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody, 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n = 99), or to observation only (n = 90). Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval. Patients were stratified by a dynamic randomization according to center, sex, location of tumor, number of affected lymph nodes, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentration.\n\nResults: Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors. After 7 years of follow-vp evaluation, treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P = .01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .04; log-rank, P = .07). The intention-to-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard, P = .02; log-rank, P = .11). While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard, P = .004; log-rank, P = .004), local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard, P = .65; log-rank, P = .52). This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival.\n\nConclusion: The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients. The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow up evaluation.

ICSA studies in rodents have established that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a site supporting morphine and ethanol reinforcement. ICPC studies confirmed that injection of morphine into the VTA produces conditioned place preference (CPP). Further confirmation that activation of opioid receptors within the VTA is reinforcing comes from the findings that the endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin injected into the VTA produces CPP, and that the mu- and delta-opioid agonists, DAMGO and DPDPE, are self-infused into the VTA. Activation of the VTA dopamine (DA) system may produce reinforcing effects in general because (a) neurotensin is self-administered into the VTA, and injection of neurotensin into the VTA produces CPP and enhances DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), and (b) GABA(A) antagonists are self-administered into the anterior VTA and injections of GABA(A) antagonists into the anterior VTA enhance DA release in the NAG. The NAC also appears to have a major role in brain reward mechanisms, whereas most data from ICSA and ICPC studies do not support an involvement of the caudate-putamen in reinforcement processes. Rodents will self-infuse a variety of drugs of abuse (e.g, amphetamine, morphine, phencyclidine and cocaine) into the NAG, and this occurs primarily in the shell region. ICPC studies also indicate that injection of amphetamine into the shell portion of the NAC produces CPP. Activation of the DA system within the shell subregion of the NAC appears to play a key role in brain reward mechanisms. Rats will ICSA the DA uptake blocker, nomifensine, into the NAC shell; co-infusion with a D-2 antagonist can block this behavior. In addition, rats will self-administer a mixture of a D-1 plus a D-2 agonist into the shell, but not the core, region of the NAG. The ICSA of this mixture can be blocked with the co-infusion of either a D-1 or a D-2 antagonist. However, the interactions of other transmitter systems within the NAC may also play key roles because NMDA antagonists and the muscarinic agonist carbachol are self-infused into the NAG. The medial prefrontal (MPF) cortex supports the ICSA of cocaine and phencyclidine. The DA system also seems to play a role in this behavior since cocaine self-infusion into the MPF cortex can be blocked by co-infusing a D-2 antagonist, or with 6-OHDA lesions of the MPF cortex. Limited studies have been conducted on other CNS regions to elucidate their role in brain and drug reward mechanisms using ICSA or ICPC procedures. Among these regions, ICPC findings suggest that cocaine and amphetamine are rewarding in the rostral ventral pallidum (VP); ICSA and ICPC studies indicate that morphine is rewarding in the dorsal hippocampus, central gray and lateral hypothalamus. Finally, substance P mediated systems within the caudal VP (nucleus basalis magnocellularis) and serotonin systems of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei may also be important anatomical components involved in brain reward mechanisms. Overall, the ICSA and ICPC studies indicate that there are a number of receptors, neuronal pathways, and discrete CNS sites involved in brain reward mechanisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Only reviewed and confirmed responses were considered. The analysis of remission was based on assessable patients with documented measurable lesions. The intent-to-treat principle, log-rank test, and Cox regression model were used for the statistical analysis of time-to-event end points.\n\nResults: The overall response rate for 245 eligible patients with measurable disease was 9% with ELF, 20% with FUP, and 12% with FAMTX, with no significant differences. One hundred twelve patients were eligible for efficacy in assessable, nonmeasurable disease. No change was observed in 66% of patients treated with ELF, 56% with FUP, and 55% with FAMTX. Two patients achieved a complete tumor regression tone each for ELF and FAMTX). With a median follow-vp time of 4.5 years, the median survival times were 7.2 months with ELF, 7.2 months with FUP, and 6.7 months with FAMTX, respectively, with no significant differences. Nonhematologic and hematalagic toxicities of ELF, FUP, and FAMTX were acceptable, with neutropenia being the major toxicity for all three regimens. Seven treatment-related deaths occurred (two with FUP and five with FAMTX).\n\nConclusion: All three investigated regimens demonstrate modest clinical efficacy and should not be regarded as standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. New strategies should be considered to achieve a better clinical efficacy in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.

Both bioavailable E and testosterone (T) decrease substantially ill aging men, but it is unclear which deficiency is the more important factor contributing to the increased bone resorption and impaired bone formation that leads to their bone loss. Thus, of addressed this issue directly by eliminating endogenous T and E production in 59 elderly men (mean age 68 years), studying them first under conditions of physiologic T and E replacement and then assessing the impact on bone turnover of withdrawing both T and E, withdrawing only T, or only E, or continuing both. Bone resorption markers increased significantly in the absence of both hormones and were unchanged in men receiving both hormones.

Axillary dissection has been a routine part of breast cancer treatment for more than 100 years. Axillary node involvement is the single most important prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer. Recently, routine node dissection has been eliminated for intraductal carcinoma because so few patients had positive nodes. With the availability of numerous histologic prognosticators and the development of new immunochemical prognostic indicators, it is time to consider eliminating routine node dissection for lesions more advanced than duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but with extremely low likelihood of axillary involvement. Methods. Axillary node positivity, disease-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival were determined for six breast cancer subgroups by T category: Tis (DCIS), T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, and T3. Results. Nodal positivity for DCIS was 0%; for T1a lesions, 3%. A large increase in nodal positivity was seen in lesions larger than 5 mm. (T1b, 17%; T1c, 32%; T2, 44%; T3, 60%). The rate of nodal positivity was statistically different as each T category was compared with the next more advanced T category. The disease-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival decreased with every increment in T value. Conclusions. Axillary node positivity increases as the size of the invasive component increases and is an excellent predictor of DSF and breast cancer-specific survival. Consideration should be given to eliminating axillary node dissection for Tla lesions because of the low yield of positive nodes. Axillary node dissection should be performed routinely for T1b lesions and larger.", "ISSN": "0008-543X", "pub": "CANCER", "volume": "73", "authors": ["SILVERSTEIN, MJ", "GIERSON, ED", "WAISMAN, JR", "SENOFSKY, GM", "COLBURN, WJ", "GAMAGAMI, P"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3%3C664::AID-CNCR2820730326%3E3.0.CO;2-S/abstract;jsessionid=B55280A145EAFD4ADF2650F99BB4DE23.f01t03", "issue": "3", "pages": "664-667"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1976", "title": "DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC-ACID POLYMERASE FROM EXTREME THERMOPHILE THERMUS-AQUATICUS", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0021-9193", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY", "volume": "127", "authors": ["CHIEN, A", "EDGAR, DB", "TRELA, JM"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "1550-1557"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAY 1944", "title": "The pathology of fatal epidemic hepatitis", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0002-9440", "pub": "AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY", "volume": "20", "authors": ["Lucke, B"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "471-593"}, {"DOI": "10.1149/1.1801451", "pdflink": "http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/151/11/A1878.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "2004", "title": "Li-storage via heterogeneous reaction in selected binary metal fluorides and oxides", "abstract": "We report on electrochemical reactions of a variety of metal fluorides (TiF3, VF3, MnF2, FeF2, CoF2, NiF2, CuF2, CaF2, BaF2), metal oxides (TiO, TiO2, VO2, V2O3, V2O5, NbO, NbO2, Cr2O3, RuO2, MoO3), TiS2, and TiN with lithium in nonaqueous lithium cells over a wide voltage range (0.02-4.3 V) at room temperature.

The pretreatment stage distribution, as determined by endorectal ultrasound (u), included uT2N0 in 2%, uT3N0 in 47%, uT3N1 in 49%, and uT4N0 in 2% of cases; endorectal ultrasound was not performed in 13% of cases (15 patients). Approximately 6 weeks after completion of CTX/XRT, surgery was performed.\n\nResults: The pathological tumor stages were Tis-2N0 in 26%, T2N1 in 5%, T3N0 in 21%, T3N1 in 15%, T4N0 in 5%, and T4N1 in 1%; a complete response (CR) to preoperative CTX/XRT was pathologically confirmed in 32 (27%) of patients. Tumor downstaging occurred in 72 (62%) cases. Only 3% of cases had pathologic evidence of progressive disease. Pretreatment tumor size (< 5 cm vs. greater than or equal to 5 cm) was the only factor predictive of tumor downstaging (p < 0.04). A decrease of >1 T-stage level was accomplished in 45% of those downstaged. Overall, a sphincter-saving (SP) procedure was possible in 59% of patients and an abdominoperineal resection (APR) was required in 41% of cases. Factors predictive of SP included downstaging (p < 0.03), age > 40 years (p, < 0.007), pretreatment tumor distance, 3 to 6 cm from the anal verge (p < 0.00001), tumor size <6 cm (p < 0.02), mobility (p < 0.004), tumor stage <T4 (p < 0.01), and uN negative (p < < 0.008). SP was performed in 23 patients (72%) with a CR and in 48 (67%) of downstaged cases. Among the 69 tumors located < 6 cm from the anal verge, 29 (42%) were resected with a SP. The level of response was important for tumors located < 6 cm from the anal verge because a SP was performed in 9 of the 17 (53%) CRs in this group while only 20 of 52 patients (38%) had a SP when residual disease was present after CTX/XRT. For tumors located > 6 cm from the anal verge, SP was performed in 14 of the 15 (93%) patients with a CR and 32 of 33 (97%) of patients with residual disease (p < 0.00004).\n\nConclusions: Significant tumor downstaging results from preoperative chemoradiation allowing sphincter sparing surgery in over 40% of patients whose tumors were located < 6 cm from the anal verge and who otherwise would have required colostomy.

LIM domains are protein-protein interaction motifs(1), can binding of LIM-HD proteins to DNA(6,7) and can negatively regulate LIM-HD protein function(8).

Existing batteries utilize lightweight active materials that use electrochemical reactions of ions such as H(+), OH(-) and Li(+)/Mg(2+) to facilitate energy storage and conversion. Ideal batteries should be inexpensive, have high energy density, and be made from environmentally friendly materials; batteries based on bulk active materials do not meet these requirements. Because of slow electrode process kinetics and low-rate ionic diffusion/migration, most conventional batterie's demonstrate huge gaps between their theoretical and practical performance.\n\nTherefore, efforts are underway to improve existing battery technologies and develop new electrode reactions for the next generation of electrochemical devices. Advances in electrochemistry, surface science, and materials chemistry are leading to the use of nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and conversion. Nanostructures offer advantages over comparable bulk materials in improving battery performance.\n\nThis Account summarizes our progress in battery development using a combination of lightweight elements and nanostructured materials. We highlight the benefits of nanostructured active materials for primary zinc-manganese dioxide (Zn-Mn), lithium - manganese dioxide (Li-Mn) and metal (Mg, Al, Zn)-air batteries, as well as rechargeable lithium ion (Li-ion) and nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. Through selected examples, we illustrate the effect of structure, shape, and size on the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. Because of their numerous active sites and facile electronic/ionic transfer and diffusion, nanostructures can improve battery efficiency.\n\nIn particular, we demonstrate the properties of nanostructured active materials including Mg, Al, Si, Zn, MiO(2), CuV(2)O(6), LiNi(0.8)Co(0.2)O(2), LiFePO(4), Fe(2)O(3), Co(3)O(4), TiS(2), and Ni(OH)(2) in battery applications. Electrochemical investigations reveal that we generally attain larger capacities and improved kinetics for electrode materials as their average particle size decreases. Novel nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanourchins, and porous nanospheres show lower activation energy, enhanced reactivity, improved high-rate charge/discharge capability, and more controlled structural flexibility than their bulk counterparts. In particular, anode materials such as Si nanospheres and Fe(2)O(3) nanotubes can deliver reversible capacity exceeding 500 mA . h/g, (Graphite used commercially has a theoretical capacity of 372 mA . h/g.) Nanocomposite cathode materials such as NiP-doped LiFePO(4) and metal hydroxide-coated Ni(OH)2 nanotubes allow us to integrate functional components, which enhance electrical conductivity and suppress volume expansion. Therefore, shifting from bulk to nanostructured electrode materials could offer a revolutionary opportunity to develop advanced green batteries with large capacity, high energy and power density, and long cycle life.", "ISSN": "0001-4842", "pub": "ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH", "volume": "42", "authors": ["Chen, J", "Cheng, FY"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar800229g", "issue": "6", "pages": "713-723"}, {"DOI": "10.1097/00000658-199403000-00007", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 1994", "title": "SURGICAL-TREATMENT OF 724 CARCINOMAS OF THE GALLBLADDER - RESULTS OF THE FRENCH-SURGICAL-ASSOCIATION SURVEY", "abstract": "Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of an aggressive approach to gallbladder carcinoma on long-term survival.\n\nSummary Background Data Recent studies have shown that an aggressive surgical treatment of bile duct carcinoma can be associated with a surprising long-term survival.

The model starts with an equilibrium flux rope which contains a low-density hot component and a denser cold component, qualitatively resembling a prominence cavity with an embedded prominence. The ''eruption'' of the entire flux rope is triggered by an increase in the poloidal magnetic flux of the structure. The subsequent expansion of the flux rope through a model corona and solar wind is analyzed using macroscopic quantities, including the forces, apex speed and height from the Sun, and magnetic field. The computed flux rope properties are in good agreement with those of observed magnetic clouds. On the basis of these results, magnetic clouds are identified as the interplanetary counterpart of the magnetic field and plasma of the initial cavity.

No difference was noted in the course of CIA in the injected knee joints between Ad5E1mIL-4 and the control vector, but radiographic analysis revealed impressive reduction of joint erosion and more compact bone structure in the Ad5E1mIL-4 group.

The depth of tumor invasion (T) and regional lymph node status (N) are two factors that define the stage of an esophageal carcinoma. However, the arrangement of staging groups assumes that these factors are independent variables. A retrospective review of 359 consecutive patients undergoing esophageal resection was conducted to define the relationship between T and N and to determine whether T is a significant predictor of regional lymph node metastasis (N1).\n\nMethods. Primary treatment was operation without preoperative therapy. There were 295 (82%) adenocarcinomas, 55 (15%) squamous cell carcinomas, and 9 (3%) adenosquamous carcinomas. T status was Tis in 29 (8%) patients, T1 in 65 (18%), T2 in 37 (10%), T3 in 219 (61%), and T4 in 9 (3%). N status was NO in 161 (45%) patients and N1 in 198 (55%). M status was MO in 327 (91%) patients and M1 in 32 (9%). Stage was 0 in 29 (8%) patients, I in 58 (16%), IIA in 70 (20%), IIB in 22 (6%), III in 148 (41%), and IV in 32 (9%).\n\nResults, The likelihood of N1 disease occurring with increasing T was tested using the trend test. The percentage of patients with N1 disease is 0% for Tis, 11% for T1, 43% for T2, 77% for T3, and 67% for T4 (p < 0.001). This relationship existed for both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariable analysis identified increasing T, adenocarcinoma, and lack of well-differentiated histologic features as significant predictors of N1 disease. Compared with a T1 patient, a T2 patient is 6 times more likely to have N1 disease, a T3 patient 23 times, and a T4 patient 35 times.\n\nConclusions. We conclude that for patients with esophageal carcinoma, T is an important predictor of N and this association should be included with other established factors used in clinical staging and treatment decisions.", "ISSN": "0003-4975", "pub": "ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY", "volume": "65", "authors": ["Rice, TW", "Zuccaro, G", "Adelstein, DJ", "Rybicki, LA", "Blackstone, EH", "Goldblum, JR"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497597013878", "issue": "3", "pages": "787-792"}, {"DOI": "10.1086/382726", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/606/1/67/pdf/0004-637X_606_1_67.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 1 2004", "title": "Properties of galaxy dark matter halos from weak lensing", "abstract": "We present the results of a study of weak lensing by galaxies based on 45.5 deg(2) of R-C-band imaging data from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). We define a sample of lenses with 19.5 < R-C < 21 and a sample of background galaxies with 21.5 < R-C < 24. We present the first weak-lensing detection of the flattening of galaxy dark matter halos. We use a simple model in which the ellipticity of the halo is f times the observed ellipticity of the lens. We find a best-fit value of f = 0.77(-0.21)(+0.18) , which suggests that the dark matter halos are somewhat rounder than the light distribution. The fact that we detect a significant flattening implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution. Given the average ellipticity of the lenses, this implies a halo ellipticity of (e(halo)) = 0.33(-0.09)(+0.07) , in fair agreement with results from numerical simulations of cold dark matter. We note that this result is formally a lower limit to the flattening, since the measurements imply a larger flattening if the halos are not aligned with the light distribution. Alternative theories of gravity ( without dark matter) predict an isotropic lensing signal, which is excluded with 99.5% confidence. Hence, our results provide strong support for the existence of dark matter. We also study the average mass profile around the lenses, using a maximum likelihood analysis. We consider two models for the halo mass profile: a truncated isothermal sphere (TIS) and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. We adopt observationally motivated scaling relations between the lens luminosity and the velocity dispersion and the extent of the halo. The TIS model yields a best-fit velocity dispersion of sigma = 136 +/- 5 +/- 3 km s(-1) ( all errors are 68% confidence limits; the first error bar indicates the statistical uncertainty, whereas the second error bar indicates the systematic error) and a truncation radius s = 185(-28)(+30) h(-1) kpc for a galaxy with a fiducial luminosity of L-B = 10(10) h(-2) L-B,L-circle dot (under the assumption that the luminosity does not evolve with redshift). Alternatively, the best-fit NFW model yields a mass M-200 = (8.4 +/- 0.7 +/- 0.4) x 10(11) h(-1) M-circle dot and a scale radius r(s) = 16.2(-2.9)(+3.6) h(-1) kpc.

Toxic Cd levels inhibited uptake of nutrient elements such as P, K, S, Ca, Zn, Mn, and B by plants in an organ- and genotype-specific manner.

The mannose-specific plant lectins from Galanthus, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, Epipactis helleborine, and Listera ovata, and the N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectin from Urtica dioica would primarily be targeted at the virus-cell fusion process. Various other natural products seem to qualify as HIV-cell fusion inhibitors: the siamycins [siamycin I(BMY-29304), siamycin II (RP 71955, BMY 29303), and NP-06 (FR901724)] which are tricyclic 21-amino-acid peptides isolated from Streptomyces spp that differ from one another only at position 4 or 17 (valine or isoleucine in each case); the betulinic acid derivative RPR 103611, and the peptides tachyplesin and polyphemusin which are highly abundant in hemocyte debris of the horseshoe crabs Tachypleus tridentatus and Limulus polyphemus, i.e., the 18-amino-acid peptide T22 from which T134 has been derived. Both T22 and T134 have been shown to block T-tropic X4 HIV-1 strains through a specific antagonism with the HIV coreceptor CXCR4. A number of natural products have been reported to interact with the reverse transcriptase, i.e., baicalin, avarol, avarone, psychotrine, phloroglucinol derivatives, and, in particular, calanolides (from the tropical rainforest tree, Calophyllum lanigerum) and inophyllums (from the Malaysian tree, Calophyllum inophyllum). The natural marine substance illimaquinone would be targeted at the RNase H function of the reverse transcriptase. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane, from turmeric, the roots/rhizomes of Curcuma spp), dicaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoyltartaric acids, L-chicoric acid, and a number of fungal metabolites (equisetin, phomasetin, oteromycin, and integric acid) have all been proposed as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. Yet, we have recently shown that L-chicoric acid owes its anti-HIV activity to a specific interaction with the viral envelope gp120 rather than integrase. A number of compounds would be able to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression at the transcription level: the flavonoid chrysin (through inhibition of casein kinase II, the antibacterial peptides melittin (from bee venom) and cecropin, and EM2487, a novel substance produced by Streptomyces. Alpha-Trichosanthin (from the root tubers of Trichosanthes kirilowii), MAP30 (from Momordica charantia), GAP31 (from Gelonium multiflorum), DAP30 and DAP32 (from Dianthus caryophyllus) would act as RIPs (ribosome-inactivating proteins), suppressing the translation process.\n\nAs glycosylation inhibitors, castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin would interfere with the infectivity and secondary spread of HIV-1. And so would bellenamine [(R)-3,6-diamino-N-((aminomethyl)hex anamide] (from Streptomyces nashvillensis), albeit by an unknown mechanism. Hypericin and pseudohypericin, two aromatic polycyclic diones from Hypericum triquetrifolium (St. Johnswort), could block HIV-1 infection through a variety of mechanisms (direct virucidal effect, inhibition of secondary virus spread, inhibition of virus budding, and inactivation of the preintegration complex). A number of miscellaneous compounds, including propolis, pokeweed antiviral protein, and michellamines inhibit HIV replication by mechanisms that still have to be resolved. Cyclosporins do so by preventing the interaction of cyclophilin A with the capsid gag proteins, thus blocking both a late event (assembly) and early event (nuclear localization of the preintegration complex) in the HIV replicative cycle.

Their sequences could be determined only after proteolytic cleavages. In the case of MCoTI-I and -II, it was shown that their polypeptide backbones are cyclic, a structure that has never been described in squash TIs. They contain 34 amino acid residues with 3 disulfide bridges and measured molecular masses of 3453.0 and 3480.7, respectively. They are the largest known macrocyclic peptides containing disulfide bridges. Their sequences show strong homology to other squash TIs, suggesting a similar three-dimensional structure and an analogous mechanism of action. A model of MCoTI-II was constructed by analogy to the crystal structure of the complex between bovine trypsin and CMTI-I, indicating that the linker connecting the two termini is flexible and does not impose significant geometrical constraints. This flexibility allows an Asp-Gly peptide bond rearrangement to occur in this region, giving rise to two isoforms of MCoTI-II. Although the importance of cyclization is not clear, it might confer increased stability and resistance to proteolysis. A minor species, MCoTI-III, was also characterized as containing 30 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 3379.6. This component possesses a linear backbone with a blocked N-terminus.

The results of reporter gene analyses revealed that the insulin gene promoter is more sensitive to glycation than the control p-actin gene promoter; similar to 50 and 80% of the insulin gene promoter activity was lost when the cells were kept for 3 d in the presence of 40 and 60 mM D-ribose, respectively.

Transurethral tumor resection (TURB) is the standard therapy for such tumors, but surgery alone may not prevent tumor progression. Intravesical therapy is widely used as an adjunct to TURB. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most active intravesical agent, but whether BCG prevents tumor progression and death from bladder cancer is unknown.\n\nPatients and Methods: Between 1978 and 1981, 86 high-risk patients with superficial bladder cancer were randomly assigned to receive either TURB (n=43) or TURB plus BCG (n=43). Adverse tumor features for progression were equally distributed between the two groups. BCG was administered weekly for 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated every 3 to 6 months thereafter for progression to muscle invasion or metastasis. Control (TURB) patients with recurrent superficial tumors were eligible for crossover to the BCG arm. All patients have been monitored until event or for a minimum of 10 years (range, 10 to 14).\n\nResults: The 10-year progression-free rate was 61.9% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 47.2% to 76.7%) for patients treated with BCG and 37% (95% CI, 22.9% to 53.1%) for control patients. The median progression-free interval was not reached for the BCG group and was 46 months for the control group (P=.0063). Of 18 control patients crossed over to BCG (median, 29 months), 15 did not show tumor progression, TURB plus BCG resulted in a 10-year disease-specific survival rate of 75%, compared with 55% with TURB alone (P=.03).\n\nConclusion: This study shows that intravesical therapy with delays tumor progression and death from tumor in patients who present with superficial bladder cancer.

New measures enabling better prediction of biologic behavior of large bowel cancer are highly desirable. One hundred ninety-four consecutive primary, recurrent, and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas, accessioned during 1991 at Rhode Island Hospital, were classified according to the presence and specific type of K-ras-2 point mutation.\n\nMethods. An integrated histopathologic-genetic approach was used to detect mutations starting with minute, topographically selected, tissue samples from formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens.\n\nResults. Each colorectal adenocarcinoma exhibited either no or only one of seven specific types of K-ras-2 mutation. The mutation type of each primary tumor was present consistently in its metastatic deposits. Thirty-five percent of primary colorectal adenocarcinomas were found to be mutated (42 of 119). A significantly higher mutation rate (65%) was seen in lymphogenous-hematogenous metastases as a group (35 of 54; P < 0.005). By contrast, 22% of anastomotic recurrences and transcoelomic metastasis were mutated (4 of 18). Twenty-eight percent of adenocarcinomas with invasion limited to muscularis propria (Tis, T1, T2) were mutated (16 of 57), compared to 41% for more deeply invasive tumors (T3, T4; 26 of 63). When colorectal adenocarcinomas were analyzed by specific K-ras-2 mutation type, it was found that codon 13 mutated tumors did not progress to local or distant metastasis (P < 0.01). Tumors having a codon 12 valine substitution did not metastasize beyond pericolonic-perirectal lymph nodes. In contrast, colorectal cancers with codon 12 aspartic acid substitutions accounted for most of the distant hematogenous deposits (P < 0.01). Tumors with normal K-ras-2 accounted for most intraperitoneal deposits.\n\nConclusions. Genotyping of colorectal adenocarcinoma by K-ras-2 status can identify subsets of patients likely to pursue indolent and aggressive forms of disease. The integrated histopathologic-genetic approach outlined is feasible for use in diagnostic pathology, providing information that together with clinicopathologic staging may individualize and optimize treatment.", "ISSN": "0008-543X", "pub": "CANCER", "volume": "71", "authors": ["FINKELSTEIN, SD", "SAYEGH, R", "CHRISTENSEN, S", "SWALSKY, PA"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142(19930615)71:12%3C3827::AID-CNCR2820711207%3E3.0.CO;2-N/abstract;jsessionid=E069292406AE8A20A8F1C844CA0EE6D6.f01t01", "issue": "12", "pages": "3827-3838"}, {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.96.24.14037", "pdflink": "http://www.pnas.org/content/96/24/14037.full.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 23 1999", "title": "Differentially expressed protein Pdcd4 inhibits tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation", "abstract": "An mRNA differential display comparison of mouse JB6 promotion-sensitive (P+) and -resistant (P-) cells identified a novel gene product that inhibits neoplastic: transformation.

A differentially displayed fragment, A7-1. was preferentially expressed in P- cells at levels greater than or equal to 10-fold those in P+ cells, making its mRNA a candidate inhibitor of neoplastic transformation. An A7-1 cDNA was isolated that was identical to murine Pdcd4 gene cDNAs. also known as MA-3 or TIS,and analogous to human H731 and 197/15a. Until now, the function of the Pdcd4 protein has been unknown. Paralleling the mRNA levels, Pdcd4 protein levels were greater in P- than in P+ cells. Pdcd4 mRNA was also expressed at greater levels in the less progressed keratinocytes of another mouse skin neoplastic progression series. To test the hypothesis that Pdcd4 inhibits tumor promoter-induced transformation, stable cell lines expressing antisense Pdcd4 were generated from parental P- cells. The reduction of Pdcd4 proteins in antisense lines was accompanied by acquisition of a transformation-sensitive (Pf) phenotype.

To determine the clinical utility of urine-based bladder tumor markers (UBBTMs) and cytology in the treatment of patients with transitional cell carcinoma on the basis of their statistical performance.\n\nMethods. A comprehensive literature review was performed using Medline (1966 to current) and other search engines. Data regarding the statistical performance of UBBTMs were double extracted and rectified. Studies addressing comparable patient populations were combined and hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses performed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of commonly used UBBTMs, as well as urinary cytology. Patient populations were stratified by tumor stage and grade when data were presented in an extractable fashion.\n\nResults. The literature review yielded 54 publications, 338 distinct patient groups (controls, screening population, patients with cancer, strata based on grade and stage) and more than 10,000 patients. The number of groups varied from 1 to 18, and the number of patients ranged from less than 100 to more than 1500 for the various markers. All UBBTMs have better sensitivity compared with cytology, especially for low-grade/stage disease, but do not match cytology regarding specificity. In patients with grade I and 2 tumors, several UBBTMs are significantly superior statistically in terms of sensitivity compared with cytology. The sensitivity for transitional cell carcinoma in situ (Tis) is surprisingly poor for all UBBTMs.\n\nConclusions. UBBTMs can be used for follow-up of low-grade/stage tumors but should not replace cystoscopy. All UBBTMs have better sensitivity than cytology and could potentially replace routine cytology during patient follow-up. UROLOGY 61: 109-118, 2003.

Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [Cis]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases, Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% Cis) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1,03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10000 1 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10000 person-years.\n\nConclusions Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.", "ISSN": "0098-7484", "pub": "JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION", "volume": "288", "authors": ["Rossouw, JE", "Anderson, GL", "Prentice, RL", "LaCroix, AZ", "Kooperberg, C", "Stefanick, ML", "Jackson, RD", "Beresford, SAA", "Howard, BV", "Johnson, KC", "Kotchen, JM", "Ockene, J"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "321-333"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0092-8674(93)90500-P", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286749390500P/pdf?md5=27606d8ccfa9a6f299690b069027e424&pid=1-s2.0-009286749390500P-main.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 19 1993", "title": "WAF1, A POTENTIAL MEDIATOR OF P53 TUMOR SUPPRESSION", "abstract": "The ability of p53 to activate transcription from specific sequences suggests that genes induced by p53 may mediate its biological role as a tumor suppressor.

The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individual-based model. We found that in most cases the estimated 'log probability of data' does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic Delta K based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested.

In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations.\n\nMethods 20 536 UK adults (aged 40-80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These \"Intention-to-treat\"comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.\n\nFindings All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10 269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10 267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0-4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% Cl 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and-most notably-even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.\n\nInterpretation Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.", "ISSN": "0140-6736", "pub": "LANCET", "volume": "360", "authors": ["Collins, R", "Armitage, J", "Parish, S", "Sleight, P", "Peto, R"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "9326", "pages": "7-22"}, {"DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa020047", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "SEP 26 2002", "title": "Peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus infection.", "abstract": "Background: Treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a alone produces significantly higher sustained virologic responses than treatment with interferon alfa-2a alone in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.\n\nResults. - Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22), The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P < .001).

The treatment did increase the rate of thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. Based on the finding of no overall cardiovascular benefit and a pattern of early increase in risk of CHD events, we do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of CHD.

We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients.\n\nMethods: Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28.\n\nResults: The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11; P=0.007).

When CD4(+) cell suspensions prepared from BALB/c nu/+ mice lymph nodes and spleens were depleted of CD25(+) cells by specific mAb and C, and then inoculated into BALB/c athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, all recipients spontaneously developed histologically and serologically evident autoimmune diseases (such as thyroiditis, gastritis, insulitis, sialoadenitis, adrenalitis, oophoritis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis); some mice also developed graft-vs-host-like wasting disease. Reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells within a limited period after transfer of CD4(+)CD25(-) cells prevented these autoimmune developments in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the reconstitution several days later, or inoculation of an equivalent dose of CD8(+) cells, was far less efficient for the prevention. When nu/nu mice were transplanted with allogeneic skins or immunized with xenogeneic proteins at the time of CD25(-) cell inoculation, they showed significantly heightened immune responses to the skins or proteins, and reconstitution of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells normalized the responses. Taken together, these results indicate that CD4(+)CD25(+) cells contribute to maintaining self-tolerance by down-regulating immune response to self and non-self Ags in an Ag-nonspecific manner, presumably at the T cell activation stage; elimination/reduction of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells relieves this general suppression, thereby not only enhancing immune responses to non-self Ags, but also eliciting autoimmune responses to certain self-Ags.

We studied whether inflammation increases the risk of a first thrombotic event and whether treatment with aspirin decreases the risk.\n\nMethods We measured plasma C-reactive protein, a marker for systemic inflammation, in 543 apparently healthy men participating in the Physicians' Health Study in whom myocardial infarction, stroke, or venous thrombosis subsequently developed, and in 543 study participants who did not report vascular disease during a follow-up period exceeding eight years. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or placebo at the beginning of the trial.\n\nResults Base-line plasma C-reactive protein concentrations were higher among men who went on to have myocardial infarction (1.51 vs. 1.13 mg per liter, P<0.001) or ischemic stroke (1.38 vs. 1.13 mg per liter, P=0.02), but not venous th rombosis (1.26 vs. 1.13 mg per liter, P=0.34), than among men without vascular events. The men in the quartile with the highest C-reactive protein values had three times the risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 2.9; P<0.001) and two times the risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk, 1.9; P=0.02) of the men in the lowest quartile. Risks were stable over long periods, were not modified by smoking, and were independent of other lipid-related and non-lipid-related risk factors. The use of aspirin was associated with significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction (55.7 percent reduction, P=0.02) among men in the highest quartile but with only small, nonsignificant reductions among those in the lowest quartile (13.9 percent, P=0.77).\n\nConclusions The base-line plasma concentration of C-reactive protein predicts the risk of future myocardial infarction and stroke. Moreover, the reduction associated with the use of aspirin in the risk of a first myocardial infarction appears to be directly related to the level of C-reactive protein, raising the possibility that antiinflammatory agents may have clinical benefits in preventing cardiovascular disease.

Nevertheless, its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system. Among these properties are NF-kappa B's rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals, its direct participation in cytoplasmic/nuclear signaling, and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins. In vertebrates, five distinct DNA binding subunits are currently known which might extensively heterodimerize, thereby forming complexes with distinct transcriptional activity, DNA sequence specificity, and cell type- and cell stage-specific distribution. The activity of DNA binding NF-kappa B dimers is tightly controlled by accessory proteins called I kappa B subunits of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates. I kappa B proteins inhibit DNA binding and prevent nuclear uptake of NF-kappa B complexes. An exception is the Bcl-3 protein which in addition can function as a transcription activating subunit in the nucleus. Other I kappa B proteins are rather involved in terminating NF-kappa B's activity in the nucleus. The intracellular events that lead to the inactivation of I kappa B, i.e. the activation of NF-kappa B, are complex. They involve phosphorylation and proteolytic reactions and seem to be controlled by the cells' redox status. Interference with the activation or activity of NF-kappa B may be beneficial in suppressing toxic/septic shock, graft-vs-host reactions, acute inflammatory reactions, acute phase response, and radiation damage. The inhibition of NF-kappa B activation by antioxidants and specific protease inhibitors may provide a pharmacological basis for interfering with these acute processes.", "ISSN": "0732-0582", "pub": "ANNUAL REVIEW OF IMMUNOLOGY", "volume": "12", "authors": ["BAEUERLE, PA", "HENKEL, T"], "DOIlink": "http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.iy.12.040194.001041", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "141-179"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604170189/pdfft?md5=1db8f305a9c80ef6a5ff95bd86f8f830&pid=1-s2.0-S0140673604170189-main.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 11 2004", "title": "Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): case-control study", "abstract": "Background Although more than 80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries.

However, the risk of major bleeding is increased among patients treated with clopidogrel. (N Engl J Med 2001;345:494-502.)

patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum cholesterol levels, women, and older persons.\n\nObjective.-To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.\n\nDesign.-A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nSetting.-Outpatient clinics in Texas.\n\nParticipants.-A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C and below-average HDL-C las characterized by lipid percentiles for an age-and sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14) mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women (25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile).\n\nIntervention.-Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet.\n\nMain Outcome Measures.-First acute major coronary event defined as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death.\n\nResults.-After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the incidence of first acute major coronary events (183 vs 116 first events; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P<.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs 57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P=.002), unstable angina (87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P=.02), coronary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P=.001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92; P=.006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P=.003).

Balloon-expandable coronary-artery stents were developed to prevent coronary restenosis after coronary angioplasty. These devices hold coronary vessels open at sites that have been dilated. However, it is unknown whether stenting improves longterm angiographic and clinical outcomes as compared with standard balloon angioplasty.\n\nMethods. A total of 520 patients with stable angina and a single coronary-artery lesion were randomly assigned to either stent implantation (262 patients) or standard balloon angioplasty (258 patients). The primary clinical end points were death, the occurrence of a cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, the need for coronary-artery bypass surgery, or a second percutaneous intervention involving the previously treated lesion, either at the time of the initial procedure or during the subsequent seven months. The primary angiographic end point was the minimal luminal diameter at follow-up, as determined by quantitative coronary angiography.\n\nResults. After exclusions, 52 patients in the stent group (20 percent) and 76 patients in the angioplasty group (30 percent) reached a primary clinical end point (relative risk, 0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.92; P = 0.02). The difference in clinical-event rates was explained mainly by a reduced need for a second coronary angioplasty in the stent group (relative risk, 0.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.85; P = 0.005). The mean (+/-SD) minimal luminal diameters immediately after the procedure were 2.48+/-0.39 mm in the stent group and 2.05+/-0.33 mm in the angioplasty group; at follow-up, the diameters were 1.82+/-0.64 mm in the stent group and 1.73+/-0.55 mm in the angioplasty group (P = 0.09), which correspond to rates of restenosis (diameter of stenosis, greater than or equal to 50 percent) of 22 and 32 percent, respectively (P = 0.02). Peripheral vascular complications necessitating surgery, blood transfusion, or both were more frequent after stenting than after balloon angioplasty (13.5 vs. 3.1 percent, P<0.001). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in the stent group than in the angioplasty group (8.5 vs. 3.1 days, P<0.001).\n\nConclusions. Over seven months of follow-up, the clinical and angiographic outcomes were better in patients who received a stent than in those who received standard coronary angioplasty.

Aspirin and ticlopidine have been shown to be effective, but both have potentially serious adverse effects. Clopidogrel, a new thienopyridine derivative similar to ticlopidine, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate.\n\nMethods CAPRIE was a randomised, blinded, international trial designed to assess the relative efficacy of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) and aspirin (325 mg once daily) in reducing the risk of a composite outcome cluster of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; their relative safety was also assessed. The population studied comprised subgroups of patients with atherosclerotic Vascular disease manifested as either recent ischaemic stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Patients were followed for 1 to 3 years.\n\nFindings 19 185 patients, with more than 6300 in each of the clinical subgroups, were recruited over 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 1 . 91 years. There were 1960 first events included in the outcome cluster on which an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with clopidogrel had an annual 5 . 32% risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death compared with 5 . 83% with aspirin. These rates reflect a statisticaly significant (p=0 . 043) relative-risk reduction of 8 . 7% in favour of clopidogrel (95% CI 0 . 3-16 . 5). Corresponding on-treatment analysis yielded a relative-risk reduction of 9 . 4%. There were no major differences in terms of safety. Reported adverse experiences in the clopidogrel and aspirin groups judged to be severe included rash (0 . 26% vs 0 . 10%), diarrhoea (0 . 23% vs 0 . 11%), upper gastrointestinal discomfort (0 . 97% vs 1 . 22%), intracranial haemorrhage (0 . 33% vs 0 . 47%), and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (0 . 52% vs 0 . 72%), respectively. There were ten (0 . 10%) patients in the clopidogrel group with significant reductions in neutrophils (<1 . 2 X 10(9)/L) and 16 (0 . 17%) in the aspirin group.\n\nInterpretation Long-term administration of clopidogrel to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.

The patients who underwent stenting had a higher rate of procedural success than those who underwent standard balloon angioplasty (96.1 percent vs. 89.6 percent, P = 0.011), a larger immediate increase in the diameter of the lumen (1.72+/-0.46 vs. 1.23+/-0.48 mm, P<0.001), and a larger luminal diameter immediately after the procedure (2.49+/-0.43 vs. 1.99+/-0.47 mm, P<0.001). At six months, the patients with stented lesions continued to have a larger luminal diameter (1.74+/-0.60 vs. 1.56+/-0.65 mm, P = 0.007) and a lower rate of restenosis (31.6 percent vs. 42.1 percent, P = 0.046) than those treated with balloon angioplasty. There were no coronary events (death; myocardial infarction; coronary-artery bypass surgery; vessel closure, including stent thrombosis; or repeated angioplasty) in 80.5 percent of the patients in the stent group and 76.2 percent of those in the angioplasty group (P = 0.16). Revascularization of the original target lesion because of recurrent myocardial ischemia was performed less frequently in the stent group than in the angioplasty group (10.2 percent vs. 15.4 percent, P = 0.06).\n\nConclusions. Inselected patients, placement of an intracoronary stent, as compared with balloon angioplasty, results in an improved rate of procedural success, a lower rate of angiographically detected restenosis, a similar rate of clinical events after six months, and a less frequent need for revascularization of the original coronary lesion.", "ISSN": "0028-4793", "pub": "NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE", "volume": "331", "authors": ["FISCHMAN, DL", "LEON, MB", "BAIM, DS", "SCHATZ, RA", "SAVAGE, MP", "PENN, I", "DETRE, K", "VELTRI, L", "RICCI, D", "NOBUYOSHI, M", "CLEMAN, M", "HEUSER, R", "ALMOND, D", "TEIRSTEIN, PS", "FISH, RD", "COLOMBO, A", "BRINKER, J", "MOSES, J", "SHAKNOVICH, A", "HIRSHFELD, J", "BAILEY, S", "ELLIS, S", "RAKE, R", "GOLDBERG, S"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199408253310802", "issue": "8", "pages": "496-501"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAY 5 2009", "title": "A New Equation to Estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate", "abstract": "Background: Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are routinely used to assess kidney function.

Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks the EGFR.

Controlled clinical trials have shown that beta-blockers can produce hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in chronic heart failure, but the effect of these drugs on survival has not been determined.\n\nMethods. We enrolled 1094 patients with chronic heart failure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified program, in which patients were assigned to one of four treatment protocols on the basis of their exercise capacity. Within each of the four protocols patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure with left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 398) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (n = 696); background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Patients were observed for the occurrence of death or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons during the following 6 months (12 months for the group with mild heart failure).\n\nResults. The overall mortality rate was 7.8 percent in the placebo group and 3.2 percent in the carvedilol group; the reduction in risk attributable to carvedilol was 65 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 80 percent; P < 0.001). This finding led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to recommend termination of the study before its scheduled completion. in addition, as compared with placebo, carvedilol therapy was accompanied by a 27 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (19.6 percent vs. 14.1 percent, P = 0.036), as well as a 38 percent reduction in the combined risk of hospitalization or death (24.5 percent vs. 15.8 percent, P < 0.001). Worsening heart failure as an adverse reaction during treatment was less frequent in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group.\n\nConclusions. Carvedilol reduces the risk of death as well as the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure who are receiving treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.

We then assessed the flavonoid intake of 805 men aged 65-84 years in 1985 by a cross-check dietary history; the men were then followed up for 5 years.

There have been many randomised trials of adjuvant tamoxifen among women with early breast cancer, and an updated overview of their results is presented.\n\nMethods. In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen before recurrence. Information was obtained and analysed centrally on each of 37000 women in 55 such trials, comprising about 87% of the worldwide evidence. Compared with the previous such overview, this approximately doubles the amount of evidence from trials of about 5 years of tamoxifen and, taking all trials together, on events occurring more than 5 years after randomisation.\n\nFindings. Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (SD 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (x(1)(2) = 52.0, 2p < 0.00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (X-1(2) = 8.8, 2p = 0.003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10.9% (SD 2.5) for node-positive (61.4% vs 50.5% survival, 2p < 0.00001) and 5.6% (SD 1.3) for node-negative (78.9% vs 73.3% survival, 2p < 0.00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied tie, including those with \"ER-poor\" tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13% (SD 13), 26% (SD 9), and 47% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer, Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0.99 [SD 0.05]).\n\nInterpretation. For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments.", "ISSN": "0140-6736", "pub": "LANCET", "volume": "351", "authors": ["Clarke, M", "Collins, R", "Davies, C", "Godwin, J", "Gray, R", "Peto, R"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "9114", "pages": "1451-1467"}, {"DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa013168", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "JUN 13 2002", "title": "Cardiac resynchronization in chronic heart failure", "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have suggested that cardiac resynchronization achieved through atrial-synchronized biventricular pacing produces clinical benefits in patients with heart failure who have an intraventricular conduction delay.

Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the CD20 B-cell antigen, has therapeutic activity in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. We conducted a randomized trial to compare CHOP chemotherapy plus rituximab with CHOP alone in elderly patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.\n\nMethods: Previously untreated patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, 60 to 80 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either eight cycles of CHOP every three weeks (197 patients) or eight cycles of CHOP plus rituximab given on day 1 of each cycle (202 patients).\n\nResults: The rate of complete response was significantly higher in the group that received CHOP plus rituximab than in the group that received CHOP alone (76 percent vs. 63 percent, P=0.005). With a median follow-up of two years, event-free and overall survival times were significantly higher in the CHOP-plus-rituximab group (P<0.001 and P=0.007, respectively). The addition of rituximab to standard CHOP chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure and death (risk ratios, 0.58 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.77] and 0.64 [0.45 to 0.89], respectively).

Bacterial populations also form persisters, dormant cells that are highly tolerant to antibiotics and play an important role in recalcitrance of biofilm infections. Stress response and dormancy appear to represent alternative strategies of cell survival. The mechanism of persister formation is unknown, but isolated persisters show increased levels of toxin/antitoxin (TA) transcripts. We have found previously that one or more components of the SOS response induce persister formation after exposure to a DNA-damaging antibiotic. The SOS response induces several TA genes in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that a knockout of a particular SOS-TA locus, tisAB/istR, had a sharply decreased level of persisters tolerant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that causes DNA damage. Step-wise administration of ciprofloxacin induced persister formation in a tisAB-dependent manner, and cells producing TisB toxin were tolerant to multiple antibiotics. TisB is a membrane peptide that was shown to decrease proton motive force and ATP levels, consistent with its role in forming dormant cells.

Here, we describe a novel E. coli chromosome locus that is part of the SOS response to DNA damage. This locus encodes two sRNAs, IstR-1 and IstR-2, and a toxic peptide, TIsB, encoded by tisAB mRNA. Transcription of tisAB and istR-2 is SOS regulated, whereas IstR-1 is present throughout growth. IstR-1 inhibits toxicity by base-pairing to a short region in the tisAB mRNA. This antisense interaction entails RNase Ill-dependent cleavage, thereby inactivating the mRNA for translation. In the absence of the SOS response, IstR-1 is present in high excess over its target. However, SOS induction leads to depletion of the IstR-1 pool, concomitant with accumulation of tisAB mRNA. Under such conditions, TisB exerts its toxic effect, slowing down growth. We propose that the inhibitory sRNA prevents inadvertent TisB synthesis during normal growth and, possibly, also limits SOS-induced toxicity.

In vitro translation, toeprinting, and structure mapping suggest that active, but not inactive, tisAB mRNAs contain an upstream ribosome loading or \"standby\" site.

The onset of toxicity correlated with a drastic decrease in transcription, translation and replication rates.

The crystal structure consists in part of channels formed by the metal atoms (M = Zr, Ti), which include a planar Sb ladder exhibiting short Sb-Sb distances (284 pm c/2) parallel and longer ones (ca. 347 pm) perpendicular to the chain directions. The channels are further surrounded by Sb atoms, which belong in part to the embedding NiAs-type fragments. In contrast to TiSb (NiAs type) and ZrSb (ZrSb type), the new structure is stabilized by strong Sb-Sb bonding (in addition to M-Sb and M-M bonding).

Persisters can be produced stochastically in a population untreated with antibiotics. At the same time, a deterministic component of persister formation has also been documented in a population of cells with DNA damaged by fluoroquinolone treatment. Expression of the SOS response under these conditions induces formation of persisters by increasing expression of the TisB toxin. This suggests that other stress responses may also contribute to persister formation. Of particular interest is oxidative stress that pathogens encounter during infection. Activated macrophages produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which induce the SoxRS and OxyR regulons. Genes controlled by these regulons deactivate the oxidants and promote repair. We examined the ability of oxidative stress induced by paraquat (PQ) to affect persister formation. Preincubation of cells with PQ produced a dramatic increase in the number of persisters surviving challenge with fluoroquinolone antibiotics. PQ did not affect killing by kanamycin or ampicillin. Persisters in a culture treated with PQ that survived a challenge with a fluoroquinolone were also highly tolerant to other antibiotics. PQ induces SoxRS, which in turn induces expression of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug-resistant (MDR) pump. Fluoroquinolones are extruded by this MDR pump, and the effect of PQ on antibiotic tolerance was largely abolished in a mutant that was defective in the pump. It appears that PQ, acting through AcrAB-TolC, reduces the concentration of fluoroquinolones in the cells. This allows a larger fraction of cells to become persisters in the presence of a fluoroquinolone. Analysis of a lexA3 mutant indeed showed a dependence of persister induction under these conditions on SOS. These findings show that induction of a classical resistance mechanism, MDR efflux, by oxidative stress leads to an increase in multidrug-tolerant persister cells.", "ISSN": "0066-4804", "pub": "ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY", "volume": "56", "authors": ["Wu, YX", "Vulic, M", "Keren, I", "Lewis, K"], "DOIlink": "http://aac.asm.org/content/56/9/4922", "issue": "9", "pages": "4922-4926"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.2196050", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/apl/88/16/1.2196050.pdf;jsessionid=29vse42ghc4pm.x-aip-live-03?itemId=/content/aip/journal/apl/88/16/10.1063/1.2196050&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/apl", "pubDate": "APR 17 2006", "title": "Do all III-V compounds have the zinc-blende or wurtzite ground state structure?", "abstract": "The zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (W) structures are the most common crystal forms of binary III-V compounds; however, little is known about the stability of the missing TI-V and III-Bi compounds.

We studied the structure and membrane interactions of TisB to find out whether it forms pores or other proton-selective channels. Circular dichroism revealed an amphiphilic alpha-helical structure when reconstituted in lipid vesicles, and oriented circular dichroism showed that the helix assumes a transmembrane alignment. The addition of TisB to dye-loaded vesicles caused leakage only at very high peptide concentration, notably with a Hill coefficient of 2, which suggests that dimers must be involved. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations showed that membrane binding of monomeric TisB is rapid and spontaneous, and transmembrane insertion is energetically feasible. When TisB oligomers are assembled as transmembrane pores, these channels collapse during the simulations, but transmembrane dimers are found to be stable. Given the pattern of charges on the amphiphilic TisB helix, we postulate that antiparallel dimers could be assembled via a ladder of salt bridges.

Persisters are dormant phenotypic variants of regular cells rather than mutants. Bactericidal antibiotics kill by corrupting their targets into producing toxic products; tolerance to antibiotics follows when targets are inactive. Transcriptome analysis of isolated persisters points to toxin/antitoxin modules as a principle component of persister formation. Mechanisms of persister formation are redundant, making it difficult to eradicate these cells. In Escherichia coli, toxins RelE and MazF cause dormancy by degrading mRNA; HipA inhibits translation by phosphorylating Ef-Tu; and TisB forms an anion channel in the membrane, leading to a decrease in pmf and ATP levels. Prolonged treatment of chronic infections with antibiotics selects for hip mutants that produce more persister cells. Eradication of tolerant persisters is a serious challenge. Some of the existing antibiotics are capable of killing persisters, pointing to ways of developing therapeutics to treat chronic infections. Mitomycin is a prodrug which is converted into a reactive compound forming adducts with DNA upon entering the cell.

Ferromagnetic ordering develops within the ab plane at T-C = 130 K for U3ScSb5 and 160 K for U3TiSb5, but there are essentially no magnetic interactions parallel to the c axis, confirming the high anisotropy expected from the crystal structure. In both cases, the easy axis for magnetization is the [120] direction. A sharp decrease below the ordering temperature is observed in the electrical resistivity parallel to the c axis; in contrast, the temperature dependence is much weaker within the ab plane. For U3TiSb5, a second transition occurs at 25 K, possibly arising from a spin reorientation process. The thermoelectric power measured along the c axis for both compounds is positive and small at high temperatures, following approximately a linear dependence with temperature indicative of metallic behavior in this region. The thermopower exhibits a kink at the ferromagnetic transition temperature in the case of U3TiSb5, but it is not so clear in the case of U3ScSb5.

This technique is particularly useful in the study(4,5) and in the control(6) of materials whose physical properties are governed by the interactions between multiple degrees of freedom. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in this context a direct and comprehensive, energy- and momentum-selective probe of the ultrafast processes that couple to the electronic degrees of freedom(7-10). Previously, the capability of such studies to access electron momentum space away from zero momentum was, however, restricted owing to limitations of the available probing photon energy(10,11). Here, using femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by a high-harmonic-generation source, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the photoinduced vaporization of a charge-ordered state in the potential excitonic insulator 1T-TiSe(2) (refs 12, 13). By way of stroboscopic imaging of electronic band dispersions at large momentum, in the vicinity of the edge of the first Brillouin zone, we reveal that the collapse of atomic-scale periodic long-range order happens on a timescale as short as 20 femtoseconds. The surprisingly fast response of the system is assigned to screening by the transient generation of free charge carriers. Similar screening scenarios are likely to be relevant in other photoinduced solid-state transitions and may generally determine the response times. Moreover, as electron states with large momenta govern fundamental electronic properties in condensed matter systems(14), we anticipate that the experimental advance represented by the present study will be useful to study the ultrafast dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of electronic phenomena in a wide range of materials.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "471", "authors": ["Rohwer, T", "Hellmann, S", "Wiesenmayer, M", "Sohrt, C", "Stange, A", "Slomski, B", "Carr, A", "Liu, YW", "Miaja-Avila, L", "Kallane, M", "Mathias, S", "Kipp, L", "Rossnagel, K", "Bauer, M"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09829", "issue": "7339", "pages": "490-+"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.226402", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 3 2002", "title": "Electron-hole coupling and the charge density wave transition in TiSe2", "abstract": "Angle-resolved photoemission is employed to measure the band structure of TiSe2 in order to clarify the nature of the (2x2x2 ) charge density wave transition.

One such material, TiSe2, has recently been found to superconduct under pressure [A. F. Kusmartseva, B. Sipos, H. Berger, L. Forro, and E. Tutis, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 236401 (2009)]. This finding cannot be explained simply as conventional superconductivity arising from an imbalance of charge carriers. To understand the nature of the fluctuations driving this superconducting phase, it is necessary to elucidate the driving mechanism of the charge ordered state from which it arises. Here we analyze the normal state of TiSe2 starting from a tight-binding model to fit its band structure. The results of this procedure suggest that TiSe2 is best viewed as a system of weakly linked quasi-one-dimensional chains. Building on these findings we propose a simplified quasi-one-dimensional model in which the interaction between the structural and excitonic charge fluctuations can be studied. The balance between competition and cooperation of these degrees of freedom is seen to have a large effect on the nature of the observed charge density wave transition. It is found that neither type of excitation can be held solely responsible for the transition and that it is rather the combined influence of both excitons and phonons that must underlie the observed properties of the charge density wave phase of TiSe2.

It has been found that the effective magnetic moment mu (eff) of Cr changes nonmonotonously with Cr-content. The mu (eff)(x) dependence correlates with the change in the interlayer distance at the intercalation which is attributed to the change of the localization degree of the chromium 3d-electrons. The intercalation lends to changes of the magnetic state of CrlambdaTiSe2 from the Pauli paramagnetism at x = 0 to the claster-glass behavior at 0.25 less than or equal tox less than or equal to0.33 and then to the antiferromagnetic order in Cr0.5TiSe2.

The applied hydrostatic pressure decreases the Neel temperature with a rate dT(N) / dp = -0.19 K/kbar.

In 487 elderly women aged 65-77 years, we examined the association of smoking with physical performance measures of muscle function and whether the effect of smoking on physical performance measures is mediated through its effect on vitamin D or estrogen metabolism.\n\nMethods. Timed tise, timed walk at normal and fast speed, grip strength, and serum biochemical measurements were compared between smokers, past smokers, and nonsmokers. Analysis of covariance was used to compare physical performance variables while adjusting for confounding variables.\n\nResults. Compared to nonsmokers and past smokers, current smokers were significantly (p <.05) slower on timed rise and timed walk tests and had decreased grip strength. From multivariate analysis, smoking, age, total body fat, and serum 1,25(OH)(2)D examined as quartiles were predictors of physical performance measures. The effect of current smoking on physical performance was equivalent to a normal age-related decline in physical performance tests of 7-11 years depending on the test.\n\nConclusions. The results of this study suggest that current smoking is a risk factor for decreased muscle strength leading to decreased physical performance in elderly women. The effect of smoking on physical performance is in part mediated by its effect on 1,25(OH)(2)D metabolism.

The magnetic proper-ties in the high temperature region exhibit Curie-Weiss behaviour with a paramagnetic Curie temperature theta of -300(5) K indicating strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Between, about 100 and 300 K the susceptibility data pass a very broad maximum and a qualitatively explanation is presented that base on antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between Cr atoms forming linear trimers, dimers, or Cr atoms being isolated. Below about 50 K the zero field cooled and field cooled susceptibility curves diverge suggesting spin glass behaviour. In the low temperature neutron diffraction patterns no additional peaks are observed which gives further evidence for the occurrence of a spin glass. Below 120 K the background of the diffraction patterns becomes modulated due to the short range magnetic interactions with sizes of the domains ranging from about 15 to 38 Angstrom. Low temperature single crystal X-ray investigations show a remarkable change of the contraction of the lattice parameters below about 220 K that may be due to the onset of the strong magnetic exchange interactions.

This technique is particularly useful in the study(4,5) and in the control(6) of materials whose physical properties are governed by the interactions between multiple degrees of freedom. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is in this context a direct and comprehensive, energy- and momentum-selective probe of the ultrafast processes that couple to the electronic degrees of freedom(7-10). Previously, the capability of such studies to access electron momentum space away from zero momentum was, however, restricted owing to limitations of the available probing photon energy(10,11). Here, using femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by a high-harmonic-generation source, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure the photoinduced vaporization of a charge-ordered state in the potential excitonic insulator 1T-TiSe(2) (refs 12, 13). By way of stroboscopic imaging of electronic band dispersions at large momentum, in the vicinity of the edge of the first Brillouin zone, we reveal that the collapse of atomic-scale periodic long-range order happens on a timescale as short as 20 femtoseconds. The surprisingly fast response of the system is assigned to screening by the transient generation of free charge carriers. Similar screening scenarios are likely to be relevant in other photoinduced solid-state transitions and may generally determine the response times. Moreover, as electron states with large momenta govern fundamental electronic properties in condensed matter systems(14), we anticipate that the experimental advance represented by the present study will be useful to study the ultrafast dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of electronic phenomena in a wide range of materials.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "471", "authors": ["Rohwer, T", "Hellmann, S", "Wiesenmayer, M", "Sohrt, C", "Stange, A", "Slomski, B", "Carr, A", "Liu, YW", "Miaja-Avila, L", "Kallane, M", "Mathias, S", "Kipp, L", "Rossnagel, K", "Bauer, M"], "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7339/full/nature09829.html", "issue": "7339", "pages": "490-+"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.226402", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 3 2002", "title": "Electron-hole coupling and the charge density wave transition in TiSe2", "abstract": "Angle-resolved photoemission is employed to measure the band structure of TiSe2 in order to clarify the nature of the (2x2x2 ) charge density wave transition.

In this study we demonstrate general applicability of synthetic protocols to a wide range of colloidal 2-D layered transition-metal chalcogenide (TMC) nanocrystals. As distinctly different from other nanocrystals, we discovered that 2-D layered TMC nanocrystals are unstable in the presence of reactive radicals from elemental chalcogen during the crystal formation. We first introduce the synthesis of titanium sulfide and selenide where well-defined single crystallinity and lateral size controllability are verified, and then such synthetic protocols are extended to all of group IV and V transition-metal sulfide (TiS2, ZrS2, HfS2, VS2, NbS2, and TaS2) and selenide (TiSe2, ZrSe3, HfSe3, VSe2, NbSe2, and TaSe2) nanocrystals.

One such material, TiSe2, has recently been found to superconduct under pressure [A. F. Kusmartseva, B. Sipos, H. Berger, L. Forro, and E. Tutis, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 236401 (2009)]. This finding cannot be explained simply as conventional superconductivity arising from an imbalance of charge carriers. To understand the nature of the fluctuations driving this superconducting phase, it is necessary to elucidate the driving mechanism of the charge ordered state from which it arises. Here we analyze the normal state of TiSe2 starting from a tight-binding model to fit its band structure. The results of this procedure suggest that TiSe2 is best viewed as a system of weakly linked quasi-one-dimensional chains. Building on these findings we propose a simplified quasi-one-dimensional model in which the interaction between the structural and excitonic charge fluctuations can be studied. The balance between competition and cooperation of these degrees of freedom is seen to have a large effect on the nature of the observed charge density wave transition. It is found that neither type of excitation can be held solely responsible for the transition and that it is rather the combined influence of both excitons and phonons that must underlie the observed properties of the charge density wave phase of TiSe2.

In the low temperature neutron diffraction patterns no additional peaks are observed which gives further evidence for the occurrence of a spin glass. Below 120 K the background of the diffraction patterns becomes modulated due to the short range magnetic interactions with sizes of the domains ranging from about 15 to 38 Angstrom. Low temperature single crystal X-ray investigations show a remarkable change of the contraction of the lattice parameters below about 220 K that may be due to the onset of the strong magnetic exchange interactions.

The mediators of sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation are 21- and 22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer dsRNAs(5-9). Here we show that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes specifically suppress expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in different mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney (293) and HeLa cells. Therefore, 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes provide a new tool for studying gene function in mammalian cells and may eventually be used as gene-specific therapeutics.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "411", "authors": ["Elbashir, SM", "Harborth, J", "Lendeckel, W", "Yalcin, A", "Weber, K", "Tuschl, T"], "issue": "6836", "pages": "494-498"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0092-8674(94)90380-8", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867494903808/pdf?md5=e3c131ce1e91411837e12efaf86e50c0&pid=1-s2.0-0092867494903808-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 25 1994", "title": "JNK1 - A PROTEIN-KINASE STIMULATED BY UV-LIGHT AND HA-RAS THAT BINDS AND PHOSPHORYLATES THE C-JUN ACTIVATION DOMAIN", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867494903808", "abstract": "The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappaB. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response.

U0126 was also shown to inhibit endogenous promoters containing AP-1 response elements but did not affect genes lacking an AP-1 response element in their promoters. These effects of U0126 result from direct inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family members, MEK-1 and MEK-2. Inhibition is selective for MEK-1 and -2, as U0126 shows little, if any, effect on the kinase activities of protein kinase C, Abl, Raf, MEKK, ERK, JNK, MKK-3, MKK-4/SEK, MKK6, Cdk2, or Cdk4. Comparative kinetic analysis of U0126 and the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (Dudley, D. T., Pang, L., Decker, S. J., Bridges, A. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S.

Quantitative evaluation of the steady state kinetics of MEK inhibition by these compounds reveals that U0126 has approximately 100-fold higher affinity for Delta N3-S218E/S222D MEK than does PD098059. We further tested the effects of these compounds on the activity of wild type MEK isolated after activation from stimulated cells. Surprisingly, we observe a significant diminution in affinity of both compounds for wild type MEK as compared with the Delta N3-S218E/S222D mutant enzyme. These results suggest that the affinity of both compounds is mediated by subtle conformational differences between the two activated MEK forms.

ER stress increases PERK's protein-kinase activity and PERK phosphorylates eIF2 alpha on serine residue 51, inhibiting translation of messenger RNA into protein. These properties implicate PERK in a signalling pathway that attenuates protein translation in response to ER stress.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "397", "authors": ["Harding, HP", "Zhang, YH", "Ron, D"], "issue": "6716", "pages": "271-274"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/370527a0", "pdflink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v370/n6490/pdf/370527a0.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 18 1994", "title": "PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-OH KINASE AS A DIRECT TARGET OF RAS", "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v370/n6490/abs/370527a0.html", "abstract": "Ras (p21(ras)) interacts directly with the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase in a GTP-dependent manner through the Ras effector site.

The final step in the generation of A beta from the beta-amyloid precursor protein is an apparently intramembranous proteolysis by the elusive gamma-secretase(s)(1). The most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease is mutation of the genes encoding presenilins 1 and 2, which alters gamma-secretase activity to increase the production of the highly amyloidogenic A beta, isoform(2). Moreover, deletion of presenilin-2 in mice greatly reduces gamma-secretase activity(3), indicating that presenilin-1 mediates most of this proteolytic event. Here we report that mutation of either of two conserved transmembrane (TM) aspartate residues in presenilin-1, Asp 257 (in TM6) and Asp 385 (in TM7), substantially reduces A beta production and increases the amounts of the carboxy-terminal fragments of beta-amyloid precursor protein that are the substrates of gamma-secretase. We observed these effects in three different cell lines as well as in cell-free microsomes. Either of the Asp-->Ala mutations also prevented the normal endoproteolysis of preseniIin-1 in the TM6 -->TM7 cytoplasmic loop. In a functional presenilin-1 variant (carrying a deletion in exon 9) that is associated with familial Alzheimer's disease and which does not require this cleavage(4), the Asp385-->Ala mutation still inhibited gamma-secretase activity. Our results indicate that the two transmembrane aspartate residues are critical for both presenilin-1 endoproteolysis and gamma-secretase activity, and suggest that presenilin-1 is either a unique diaspartyl cofactor for gamma-secretase or is itself gamma-secretase, an autoactivated intramembranous aspartyl protease.", "ISSN": "0028-0836", "pub": "NATURE", "volume": "398", "authors": ["Wolfe, MS", "Xia, WM", "Ostaszewski, BL", "Diehl, TS", "Kimberly, WT", "Selkoe, DJ"], "issue": "6727", "pages": "513-517"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0092-8674(94)90375-1", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867494903751/pdf?md5=944b25c09b4d06fb316d4417486c3e51&pid=1-s2.0-0092867494903751-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 25 1994", "title": "GENERALIZED LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASE IN MICE, CAUSED BY A POINT MUTATION IN THE FAS LIGAND", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867494903751", "abstract": "Mice homozygous for lpr (lymphoproliferation) or gld (generalized lymphoproliferative disease) develop lymphadenopathy and suffer from autoimmune disease.

Bax has been recently reported to be an integral membrane protein associated with organelles or bound to or ganelles by Bcl-2 or a soluble protein found in the cytosol. To explore Bcl-2 family member localization in living cells, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the NH2 termini of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X-L. Confocal microscopy performed on living Cos-7 kidney epithelial cells and L929 fibroblasts revealed that GFP-Bcl-2 and GFP-Bcl-X-L had a punctate distribution and colocalized with a mitochondrial marker, whereas GFP-Bax was found diffusely throughout the cytosol. Photobleaching analysis confirmed that GFP-Bax is a soluble protein, in contrast to organelle-bound GFP-Bcl-2. The diffuse localization of GFP-Bax did not change with coexpression of high levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X-L. However, upon induction of apoptosis, GFP-Bax moved intracellularly to a punctate distribution that partially colocalized with mitochondria. Once initiated, this Bax movement was complete within 30 min, before cellular shrinkage or nuclear condensation. Removal of a COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain from GFP-Bax inhibited redistribution during apoptosis and inhibited the death-promoting activity of both Bax and GFP-Bax.

An intermediate analysis showed a striking protective effect after 27 months of follow-up. This report presents results of an extended follow-up (with a mean of 46 months per patient) and deals with the relationships of dietary patterns and traditional risk factors with recurrence.\n\nMethods and Results-Three composite outcomes (COs) combining either cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (CO 1), or the preceding plus major secondary end points (unstable angina, stroke, heart failure, pulmonary or peripheral embolism) (CO 2), or the preceding plus minor events requiring hospital admission (CO 3) were studied. In the Mediterranean diet group, CO 1 was reduced (14 events versus 44 in the prudent Western-type diet group, P=0.0001), as were CO 2 (27 events versus 90, P=0.0001) and CO 3 (95 events versus 180, P=0.0002). Adjusted risk ratios ranged from 0.28 to 0.53, Among the traditional risk factors, total cholesterol (1 mmol/L being associated with an increased risk of 18% to 28%), systolic blood pressure (1 mm Hg being associated with an increased risk of 1% to 2%), leukocyte count (adjusted risk ratios ranging from 1.64 to 2.86 with count >9x10(9)/L), female sex (adjusted risk ratios, 0.27 to 0.46), and aspirin use (adjusted risk ratios, 0.59 to 0.82) were each significantly and independently associated with recurrence.\n\nConclusions-The protective effect of the Mediterranean dietary pattern was maintained up to 4 years after the first infarction, confirming previous intermediate analyses. Major traditional risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and blood pressure, were shown to be independent and joint predictors of recurrence, indicating that the Mediterranean dietary pattern did not alter, at least qualitatively, the usual relationships between major risk factors and recurrence. Thus, a comprehensive strategy to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality should include primarily a cardioprotective diet.

However, the mechanisms by which the intracellular signals of TGF-beta are switched off are unclear. Here we report the identification of Smad7, which is related to Smad6 (ref. 13). Transfection of Smad7 blocks responses mediated by TGF-beta in mammalian cells, and injection of Smad7 RNA into Xenopus embryos blocks activin/TGF-beta signalling. Smad7 associates stably with the TGF-beta receptor complex, but is not phosphorylated upon TGF-beta stimulation. TGF beta-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 is inhibited by Smad7, indicating that the antagonistic effect of Smad7 is exerted at this important regulatory step.

To address these questions, we established an assay for GTP-bound cellular Rho, Plating Swiss 3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated dishes elicited a transient inhibition of Rho, followed by a phase of Rho activation. The activation phase was greatly enhanced by serum. In serum-starved adherent cells, LPA induced transient Rho activation, whereas in suspended cells Rho activation was sustained. Furthermore, suspended cells showed higher Rho activity than adherent cells in the presence of serum. These data indicate the existence of an adhesion-dependent negative-feedback loop, We also observed that both cytochalasin D and colchicine trigger Rho activation despite their opposite effects on stress fibers and focal adhesions.

ZrTe3 is a material that undergoes a transition to a charge density wave state at 63 K and displays superconductivity below 2 K. The results of photoemission measurements using synchrotron radiation as well as temperature dependent resistivity and thermopower data allow one to sketch a detailed experimental picture of the electronic structure at the Fermi level. High level TB-LMTO-ASA band structure calculations are used to analyze the bonding situation in ZrTe3 and to relate the physical properties of the crystal to the electronic structure. ZrTe3 is a layered material whose structure is built up from trigonal prismatic ZrTe3 chains with extensive Te-Te interactions perpendicular to the chain direction. These Te-Te interactions lead to wide bands in the direction perpendicular to the chains of trigonal prisms. Frozen phonon calculations indicate that the density of states at the Fermi level and the shape of the Fermi surface are strongly dependent on the Te-Te interprism interactions. The complete computed Fermi surface consists of three independent envelopes: two sheet-like surfaces which are associated with the atoms of the Te, group and a cylindrical section, the former one being responsible for the observed charge density wave properties of ZrTe3. The experimental and calculated nesting vectors for the charge density wave are in excellent agreement. A comparison of the band structures of ZrTe3 with those of the isostructural HfTe3 and ThTe3 reveals that HfTe3 should exhibit similar electronic properties as ZrTe3, whereas ThTe3 should be semimetallic.

They are shifted towards the vacancies in the Zr atom layers. The associated corrugation of the Te atom layers is characterized by an amplitude of 28 pm. The Te-Te contacts are greater than or equal to 368.1 pm. According to extended Huckel calculations? the defects in the Zr atom layers lead to a reduction in overall Zr-Te bonding interactions relative to ZrTe (NiAs). However, through the clustering the total attractive intralayer Zr-Zr interactions increase considerably, thus providing decisive stabilization of the structure. As revealed by thermal analyses, Zr5Te6 undergoes a reversible phase transition at 1513 +/- 5 K. On the Zr-rich side, Zr5Te6 coexists with ZrTe (WC), and, above 1438 +/- 5 K with the hitherto unknown ZrTe (MnP). Zr5Te6 exhibits temperature independent paramagnetic properties (chi (mol) = 0.7 x 10(-3) cm(3)mol(-1)) that am typical for a metallic conductor. An abrupt increase in the magnitude of the diamagnetic susceptibility below 2.2 K in a weak magnetic field indicates a superconducting transition.", "ISSN": "0947-6539", "pub": "CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL", "volume": "6", "authors": ["Orlygsson, G", "Harbrecht, B"], "issue": "22", "pages": "4170-4176"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0953-8984/24/23/235702", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/24/23/235702/pdf/0953-8984_24_23_235702.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 13 2012", "title": "Superconductivity at 5.2 K in ZrTe3 polycrystals and the effect of Cu and Ag intercalation", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/24/23/235702/", "abstract": "We report the occurrence of superconductivity in polycrystalline samples of ZrTe3 at temperature 5.2 K at ambient pressure.

The orthorhombic MnP type structure is a distorted variant of the. NiAs type structure with pronounced metal-metal zigzag chains. Zigzag chains are typical for phases with a d(2) metal atom electron configuration. According to extended Huckel calculations, the homonuclear interactions in the zigzag chains make up for 2/3 of the Zr-Zr interactions in ZrTe (MnP) and contribute decisively to the stability of the structure. The emergence of the distorted MnP type structure instead of the high-symmetry NiAs type ZrTe at high temperatures can be understood as the result of an optimization of homonuclear Zr-Zr interactions arising from states close to the Fermi level. The hexagonal WC. type ZrTe transforms above 1438 +/- 5 Ii into ZrTe (MnP) (DeltaH = 8.3 +/- 1.0 kJ mol(-1)). The phase transition is reversible, although at room-temperature the reverse reaction is kinetically inhibited. Zr-5-Te-4 and Zr5Te6 are the phases nest to ZrTe.

We found that at the Nb K-edge the XAFS data of NbTe4 are extremely sensitive to metal clustering and to the subsequent departure from the average crystallographic positions. Moreover at Te K-edge the XAFS data allowed us to distinguish the different type of Te-Te bonds, for instance: the dimer (Te-Te: 2.9 Angstrom) and the squares (Te-Te: 3.3 Angstrom) in NbTe4, the interlayer and intralayer (Te-Te: 2.9-4.0 Angstrom) in NbTe2, through their Debye-Waller characteristics.

Ab initio modeling of the 26 entries with CdI2 and EuGe2 type and atomic coordinates reproduces convincingly both their c/a axial ratios and z coordinates. For CoO2 and SiTe2, both c/a and z deviate to a degree from the reported values, indicating that those materials should be reexamined for superstructures, stoichiometry, etc. Ab initio modeling of the 11 cell-and-type entries with CdI2-type and no coordinates in CRYSTMET reproduced convincingly their reported axial ratios.

All 11 patterns have been inserted in the intense diffraction line search system of CRYSTMET operated under the Materials Toolkit. Comparison of calculated patterns for SnSe2 and ZrTe2 with experimental entries in the PDF exposes the complementarity of calculated and experimental powder patterns and suggests that JCPDS pattern #15-223 should be reinterpreted in terms of the CdI2 structure type.

Further sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open-reading frames, nisB, nisT, nisC and nisI, downstream of the structural gene nisA. The nisT, nisC and nisI genes were subcloned and expressed individually in Escherichia coli, using the T7-RNA-polymerase system. This resulted in the production of radiolabelled proteins with sizes of 45 kDa (NisC) and 32 kDa (NisI). The nisT gene product was not detected, possibly because of protein instability. The deduced amino acid sequence of NisI contained a consensus lipoprotein signal sequence, suggesting that this protein is a lipid-modified extracellular membrane-anchored protein. Expression of nisI in L. lactis provided the cells with a significant level of protection against exogeneously added nisin, indicating that NisI plays a role in the immunity mechanism. In EDTA-treated E. coli cells, expression of nisI conferred up to a 170-fold increase in immunity against nisin A compared to controls. Moreover, a lactococcal strain deficient in nisin-A production, designated NZ9800, was created by gene replacement of nisA by a truncated nisA gene and was 10-fold less resistant to nisin A than the wild-type strain. A wild-type immunity level to nisin and production of nisin was obtained in strain NZ9800 harboring complementing nisA and nisZ plasmids.

Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisA structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisA gene was determined by primer extension. Additionally, a mRNA of at least 3 kb was identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisB. Antibodies were raised against the NisB protein, and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 kDa, which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of 117.5 kDa as calculated from the nisB open reading frame. Several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that NisB is associated with the membrane. This was confirmed by preparing L. lactis vesicles. The NisB protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. These results suggest that NisB is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell membrane.", "ISSN": "0099-2240", "pub": "APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY", "volume": "58", "authors": ["ENGELKE, G", "GUTOWSKIECKEL, Z", "HAMMELMANN, M", "ENTIAN, KD"], "issue": "11", "pages": "3730-3743"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 1994", "title": "REGULATION OF NISIN BIOSYNTHESIS AND IMMUNITY IN LACTOCOCCUS-LACTIS 6F3", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The biosynthetic genes of the nisin-producing strain Lactococcus lactis 6F3 are organized in an operon-like structure starting with the structural gene nisA followed by the genes nisB, nisT, and nisC, which are probably involved in chemical modification and secretion of the prepeptide (G.

Methods: We here combined two approaches to stabilize peptide pharmaceuticals, introduction of D-amino acids and cyclization, by applying an innovative enzymatic method. This method yields peptides with thioether bridges between a D-amino acid and an L-amino acid. On the basis of guidelines concerning the flanking residues of serines/threonines and cysteines, a peptide of interest is designed with serine/threonine and cysteine at appropriate positions to allow their effective participation in cyclization. In Lactococcus lactis the peptide of interest is directly or via a spacer genetically fused to a lantibiotic leader peptide which induces enzyme-catalysed synthesis of a thioether-bridged peptide. The peptide is translocated via a lantibiotic transporter, analysed by mass spectrometry and the leader peptide is removed. Because of its therapeutic relevance and terminal modifications we chose the decapeptide Luteibizing Hormone Release Hormone (LHRH) as a test case for thioether bridge introduction. The N-terminal pyroglutamate protects against aminopeptidase activity; the amidated C-terminus, which occurs in 50% of all therapeutic peptides, precludes carboxypeptidase action and is essential for optimal receptor interaction. We had Lactococcus posttranslationally introduce a thioether bridge between residues 4 and 7 of the Leu7Cys-LHRH analog QHWSYGCRPG. The N-terminal glutamine of the thioether-bridged peptide could be converted in pyroglutamate. The introduction of the thioether bridge proved to be compatible with subsequent chemical and enzymatic amidation methods. In this way biologically produced thioether LHRH was compared with LHRH isomers obtained by base-assisted sulfur extrusion. Results: Biologically produced thioether LHRH is the most stable thioether LHRH isomer with strongly enhanced proteolytic resistance compared to natural LHRH. Discussion: The data convincingly demonstrate the broad perspective of stereo- and regiospecifically generating cyclized peptide pharmaceuticals with significantly enhanced therapeutic potential.

Due to difficulties in the isolation of the proposed synthetase complex (NisBTC), mechanistic information concerning the enzymatic biosynthesis of nisin is scarce. Here, we present the molecular characterization of a number of nisin mutants that affect ring formation. We have investigated in a systematic manner how these mutations influence dehydration events, which are performed enzymatically by the dehydratase NisB. Specific mutations that hampered ring formation allowed for the dehydration of serine residues that directly follow the rings and are normally unmodified. The combined information leads to the conclusion that 1) nisin biosynthesis is an organized directional process that starts at the N terminus of the molecule and continues toward the C terminus, and 2) NisB and NisC are alternating enzymes, whose activities follow one after another in a repetitive way.

The nisin synthesis machinery, composed of the modification enzymes NisB and NisC and the transporter NisT, was used to modify and secrete a putative two-component lantibiotic of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The leader peptide of prenisin keeps nisin inactive and has a role in inducing NisB-and NisC-catalyzed modifications of the propeptide and NisT-mediated export. The highly specific NisP cleaves off the leader peptide from fully modified and exported prenisin. We present here a detailed mutagenesis analysis of the nisin leader peptide. For alternative cleavage, we successfully introduced a putative NisP autocleavage site and sites for thrombin, enterokinase, Glu-C, and factor Xa in the C-terminal part of the leader peptide. Replacing residue F-18 with Trp or Thr strongly reduced production. On the other hand, D-19A, F-18H, F-18M, L-16D, L-16K, and L-16A enhanced production. Substitutions within and outside the FNLD box enhanced or reduced the transport efficiency. None of the above substitutions nor even an internal 6His tag from positions -13 to -8 had any effect on the capacity of the leader peptide to induce NisB and NisC modifications. Therefore, these data demonstrate a large mutational freedom. However, simultaneous replacement of the FNLD amino acids by four alanines strongly reduced export and even led to a complete loss of the capacity to induce modifications. Reducing the leader peptide to MSTKDFNLDLR led to 3- or 4-fold dehydration.

In certain cases, the serine residue, at position 33 of nisin, does not undergo dehydration to Dha33. With native nisin this partially processed form represents about 10% of the total peptide, whereas with the engineered variants, [Trp30]nisin A and [Lys27,Lys31]nisin A, the proportion of peptide that escapes full processing was found to be to approximately 50%. This feature of nisin biosynthesis was exploited in an investigation of the role of the NisB protein in pre-nisin maturation. Manipulation of the level of NisB was achieved by cloning and overexpressing the plasmid-encoded nisB gene in a range of different nisin-producing strains. The resulting fourfold increase in the level of NisB significantly increased the efficiency of the dehydration reaction at Ser33.

The formulation of the composite electrode allowed enhancement of both the capacity retention as well as the rate capability. CMC/VGCF (carboxymethyl cellulose/vapor grown carbon fiber) used as a binder/conductive additive allows retention of 100% of the specific capacity during 35 cycles at 2C rate (2Li h(-1)), whereas the fading is dramatic after only a few cycles at a low rate with classical powdered electrodes. Notably, an extra capacity is observed with CMC/VGCF. In the case of FeSn2, it is shown that the improvement of performance achieved with CMC/VGCF results from better efficiency of the conductive additive to form an electronic percolation web around the active material (AM) particles rather than from the buffering of the volume variations of the AM particles, contrary to the case of Si-based electrodes. The improved cycle life is also likely due to the better ability of CMC to cover the particles compared to PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride), resulting not only in stronger interparticle bonding but also in a better SEI layer. It is suggested that the growing of an insulating SEI layer by the degradation of the liquid electrolyte is an important factor in the fading mechanism of FeSn(2) composite electrodes.

Nutrient limitation (mostly N or P) is a driving force in ecosystem development. Current techniques to determine the nature of nutrient limitation use laborious fertilization experiments.\n\n2. It was hypothesized that the N:P ratio of the vegetation directly indicates the nature of nutrient limitation on a community level (N vs. P limitation). This hypothesis was tested by reviewing data on fertilization studies in a variety of European freshwater wetland ecosystems (bogs, fens, wet heathlands, dune slacks, wet grasslands). In a subset of the data (dune slacks) between-site intraspecific variation and within-site interspecific variation in nutrient content and N:P ratio was studied in five plant species.\n\n3. A review of 40 fertilization studies reveals that an N:P ratio > 16 indicates P limitation on a community level, while an N:P ratio < 14 is indicative of N limitation. At N:P ratios between 14 and 16, either N or P can be limiting or plant growth is co-limited by N and P together. In only one out of 40 fertilization studies, the N:P ratio gave a false indication of the nature of nutrient limitation. Measuring the N:P ratio of the vegetation is a simple and cheap alternative to fertilization studies. The method can only be used under conditions where either N or P controls plant growth.\n\n4. The dataset contains a large variety of vegetation types and plant species, and 11 of the 40 sites were near-monocultures. This suggests that interspecific differences in critical N:P ratios among species may be insignificant. However, a rigorous test of this hypothesis is required.\n\n5. A survey in 18 dune slacks showed large within-site variation in N:P ratio among five species (Calamagrostis epigejos, Phragmites australis, Lycopus europaeus, Mentha aquatica and Eupatorium cannabinum). The N:P ratios of the five species suggested that within plant communities species can be differentially limited by N or P. Moreover, species with an N:P ratio that suggested P-limitation were found at sites where N controlled community biomass production, and vice versa. Between-site intraspecific variation in N and P contents and N:P ratios was also large, and about equal for the five species. This illustrates the plasticity of plant species with respect to N and P contents, probably in response to differences in N and P supply ratios.\n\n6.

In northwest Europe (as indicated by palaeoecological and geological evidence) climate changed from relatively warm and continental to oceanic. As a consequence, the ground-water table rose considerably in certain low-lying areas in The Netherlands. Archaeological and palaeoecological evidence for the abandonment of such areas in the northern Netherlands is interpreted as the effect of a rise of the water table and the extension of fens and bogs. Contraction of population and finally migration from these low-lying areas, which had become marginal for occupation, and the earliest colonisation by farming communities of the newly emerged salt marshes in the northern Netherlands around 2550 BP, is interpreted as the consequence of loss of cultivated land. Thermic contraction of ocean water and/or decreased velocity and pressure on the coast by the Gulf Stream may have caused a fall in relative sea-level rise and the emergence of these salt marshes. Evidence for a synchronous climatic change elsewhere in Europe and on other continents around 2650 BP is presented. Temporary aridity in tropical regions and a reduced transport of warmth to the temperate climate regions by atmospheric and/or oceanic circulation systems could explain the observed changes. As yet there is no clear explanation for this climate change and the contemporaneous increase of C-14 in the atmosphere. The strategy of C-14 wiggle-match dating can play an important role in the precise dating of organic deposits, and can be used to establish possible relationships between changing C-14 production in the atmosphere, climate change, and the impact of such changes on hydrology, vegetation, and human communities.", "ISSN": "0267-8179", "pub": "JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE", "volume": "11", "authors": ["VanGeel, B", "Buurman, J", "Waterbolk, HT"], "issue": "6", "pages": "451-460"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.3540", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 26 1999", "title": "Ferroelectricity induced by oxygen isotope exchange in strontium titanate perovskite", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.3540", "abstract": "Ferroelectricity was induced in SrTiO3 by the isotope exchange of O-18 for O-16, Dielectric measurements confirmed the ferroelectricity of (SrTiO3)-O-18, showing a peak at 23 K.

Since degradation experiments are time consuming, estimating the biodegradability of DOM by more easily measurable properties seems valuable. Our goal was therefore to investigate the biodegradation of DOM of different origin and to relate its extent and rate to properties such as UV absorbance, synchronous and emission scan fluorescence, XAD-8 sorption chromatography and (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. We extracted DOM from 13 different samples (maize straw, forest floors, peats, agricultural soils) and carried out a 90-day liquid incubation experiment. DOM biodegradation was quantified by CO(2) evolution. Rapidly and slowly mineralizable portions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a measure of labile and stable DOC and the respective mineralization rate constants and half-lives were calculated by a double exponential model. The extent and rate of DOM biodegradation from less humified organic material (straw, litter and fermentation layers of forest floors) were high resulting in 61-93% of DOC being mineralized. The labile fraction comprised 59-88% of total DOC. DOM extracted from agricultural soils was of an intermediate biodegradability with a CO(2) evolution comprising 17-32% of total DOC. Labile DOC represented 14-25% of total DOC. DOM extracted from peats and Oa forest floor layers was relatively stable (mineralization of 4-9% of total DOC, labile DOC: 3-6%). The half-life of the labile DOC pool was short (2-5 days), whereas that of the stable DOC pool ranged from 0.2 years (DOM from less humified material) to 8.6 years (DOM from the Oa layer under spruce). Extent and rate of DOM biodegradation were closely but nonlinearly related to DOM properties. Solutions exceeding a threshold value of UV absorbance, aromaticity, XAD-8 adsorbable C or of humification indices derived from fluorescence spectra or having carbohydrate contents below a certain level were stable against biodegradation. Relatively simple methods like UV spectroscopy, XAD-8 fractionation and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were suitable to estimate the biodegradation of DOM.

The crystal structures of two enzymes in the FEN-1 nuclease family have been solved and they provide a structural basis for the interesting steric requirements of FEN-1 substrates.

Studies of wetlands in western Europe and of other terrestrial ecosystems in North America frequently show that nutrient enrichment leads to changes in species composition, declines in overall plant species diversity, and loss of rare and uncommon species. We therefore used an extensive literature survey and analysis of data on plant species composition, species richness, productivity or standing crop, and C:N:P stoichiometry in plant tissues and surface soils to draw conclusions about the nature of nutrient limitation in temperate North American bogs, fens, marshes, and swamps, and to infer their potential response to nutrient enrichment. We searched all major bibliographic data bases for studies containing such data (through March 1998) and added relevant data from our own ongoing research. We analyzed plant and soil data sets by wetland type and by wetland soil type, and the plant data set also by growth form.\n\nExisting studies appear to confirm common generalizations: (1) plant community type changes across broad nutrient gradients; (2) species richness declines as various indicators of nutrient availability increase beyond some threshold; and (3) rare and uncommon species are almost always associated with species-rich communities. However, (1) these generalizations do not always hold within community types; (2) for many community types, the threshold beyond which richness declines has not been established, and high or low diversity may occur below that threshold; and (3) the failure of many studies to include bryophytes precludes drawing strong conclusions about nutrient availability and diversity in peatlands.\n\nMarshes had significantly lower mean nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios in live tissue than other wetland types (bogs, fens, and swamps), which did not differ significantly from each other. Mean N:P ratios in live tissues were significantly higher in peatlands than in mineral-soil wetlands. Nitrogen:phosporus ratios in litter did not differ significantly between peatlands and mineral-soil wetlands but were higher than in live tissues. Among growth forms, the highest mean N:P ratios in live tissues occurred in bryophytes, and the lowest in vascular herbaceous species. Only bryophyte live tissues differed significantly from other growth forms; litter N:P ratios were not significantly different among growth forms.\n\nAverage N:P ratios in surface soils were lower in marshes and swamps than in bogs and fens. Wetlands on mineral soils had lower average N:P ratios than wetlands on peat soils. Average surface soil N:P ratios rose sharply at high soil organic-matter contents (greater than or equal to 90%) and were generally greater than 16 at organic-matter concentrations above 20%.\n\nIn combination, plant tissue and surface soil N:P ratios suggest that a large proportion of North American wetlands are either P limited or co-limited by N and P, especially those occurring on organic soils. Only marshes have N:P ratios in both live tissues and surface soils that consistently indicate N limitation, although soils data suggest that the majority of swamps are also N limited. Vascular herbaceous species appear to be N limited, but no pattern is apparent among other growth forms. Inferences drawn from N:P stoichiometry need to be verified by examining ecosystem response to experimental fertilization. High variances in plant and soil N:P ratios suggest that understanding nutrient limitation at both the community and individual-species level may be necessary to predict changes in species composition and richness with nutrient enrichment.", "ISSN": "0012-9658", "pub": "ECOLOGY", "volume": "80", "authors": ["Bedford, BL", "Walbridge, MR", "Aldous, A"], "issue": "7", "pages": "2151-2169"}, {"DOI": "10.1023/A:1005667424292", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023%2FA%3A1005667424292.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 2001", "title": "Permafrost degradation and ecological changes associated with a warming climate in central Alaska", "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1005667424292", "abstract": "Studies from 1994-1998 on the Tanana Flats in central Alaska reveal that permafrost degradation is widespread and rapid, causing large shifts in ecosystems from birch forests to fens and bogs. Fine-grained soils under the birch forest are ice-rich and thaw settlement typically is 1-2.5 m after the permafrost thaws. The collapsed areas are rapidly colonized by aquatic herbaceous plants, leading to the development of a thick, floating organic mat. Based on field sampling of soils, permafrost and vegetation, and the construction of a GIS database, we estimate that 17% of the study area (263,964 ha) is unfrozen with no previous permafrost, 48% has stable permafrost, 31% is partially degraded, and 4% has totally degraded. For that portion that currently has, or recently had, permafrost (83% of area), similar to 42% has been affected by thermokarst development. Based on airphoto analysis, birch forests have decreased 35% and fens have increased 29% from 1949 to 1995. Overall, the area with totally degraded permafrost (collapse-scar fens and bogs) has increased from 39 to 47% in 46 y. Based on rates of change from airphoto analysis and radiocarbon dating, we estimate 83% of the degradation occurred before 1949. Evidence indicates this permafrost degradation began in the mid-1700s and is associated with periods of relatively warm climate during the mid-late 1700s and 1900s.

Moreover, most studies of AMP-induced neurotoxicity, regardless of the endpoints assessed, have been conducted using a rat model; relatively little attention has been focused on the effects of these compounds in the mouse. Here, we evaluated the potential neurotoxic effects of d-methamphetamine (dMETH), d-methylenedioxyamphetamine (d-MDA), d-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (d-MDMA) and d-fenfluramine (d-FEN) in the C57BL6/J mouse. Astrogliosis, assessed by quantification of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was taken as the main index of AMP-induced neural damage. A silver degeneration stain also was used to obtain direct evidence of AMP-induced neuronal damage.

A factorial design experiment revealed significant (P < 0.05) differences in emission of these gases related to peat type, temperature and water table position, as well as an interaction between temperature and water table. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 at 23-degrees-C were an average of 2.4 and 6.6 times larger, respectively, than those at 10-degrees-C. Compared to emissions when the columns were saturated, water table at a depth of 40 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 4.3 times and decreased CH4 emissions by an average of 5.0 times. There were significant temporal variations in gas emissions during the 6-week experiment, presumably related to variations in microbial populations and substrate availability. Using columns with static water table depths of 0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 cm, CO2 emissions showed a positive, linear relation with depth, whereas CH4 emissions revealed a negative, logarithmic relation with depth. Lowering and then raising the water table from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm revealed weak evidence of hysteresis in CO2 emissions between the falling and rising water table limbs. Hysteresis (falling > rising limb) was very pronounced for CH4 emissions, attributed to a release of CH4 stored in pore-water and a lag in the development of anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis on the rising limb. Decreases in atmospheric pressure were correlated with abnormally large emissions of CO2 and CH4 on the falling limb. Peat slurries incubated in flasks revealed few differences between the three peat types in the rates of CO2 production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

To elucidate the mechanism of \"fen-phen\"-associated valvular lesions, we examined the interaction of fenfluramine and its metabolite norfenfluramine with 5-HT2 receptor subtypes and examined the expression of these receptors in human and porcine heart valves. Fenfluramine binds weakly to 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. In contrast, norfenfluramine exhibited high affinity for 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors and more moderate affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. In cells expressing recombinant 5-HT2B receptors, norfenfluramine potently stimulated the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates, increased intracellular Ca2+, and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, the latter of which has been linked to mitogenic actions of the 5-HT2B receptor. The level of 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor transcripts in heart valves was at least 300-fold higher than the levels of 5-HT2C receptor transcript, which were barely detectable.

Under 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios, most Canadian peatlands will be exposed to increases in mean annual temperature ranging between 2 and 6 degrees C and increases in mean annual precipitation of 0 to 15 %, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the winter. The increase in CO2 uptake by plants, through warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2, is likely to be offset by increased soil respiration rates in response to warmer soils and lowered water tables. CH4 emissions are likely to decrease in most peatlands because of lowered water tables, except where the peat surface adjusts to fluctuating water tables, and in permafrost, where the collapse of dry plateau and palsa will lead to increased CH4 emission. There likely will be little change in DOC production, but DOC export to water bodies will decrease as runoff decreases. The storage of C in peatlands is sensitive to all C cycle components and is difficult to predict.

This is due to the fact that these ecosystems, among the most diversified in temperate climates, are extremely threatened; in some areas, they have almost disappeared. The re-establishment of these habitats implies to know the living conditions of the associations to be recreated. Very often, the typical species of these communities have become so rarefied that the seed bank or the seed rain are not sufficient to recreate the plant community. Most of the time, to achieve the restoration of these communities, they have to be totally recreated by sowing. For the restoration or the maintenance of the community, the soil chemical characteristics have also to be appropriate or if not modified. This research tends to establish a relation between some soil chemical factors and the plant diversity of a great number of stations. This research has illuminated the relationship between soil extractable phosphorus and potassium and plant diversity. Over 5 mg of phosphorus per 100 g of dry soil (acetate + EDTA extraction), no station containing more than 20 species per 100 m(2) has been found. The highest number of species is found below the optimum content of the soil for plant nutrition (5-8 mg P/100 g). Concerning the potassium, the highest number of species is found at 20 mg/100, a value corresponcing to an optimum content of the soil for plant nutrition. High potassium contents, in opposition to phosphorus contents, are thus compatible with high values of diversity. Other factors (i.e. pH, organic matter, total nitrogen and calcium) do not show so clearly a relation with plant diversity. Excess of N-NO3 is known for its negative effect on the diversity of plant communities. In these environments, apart from the atmospheric deposits which can be important in some areas, N-NO3 is derived mainly from the symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by legumes as well as from the mineralization of the organic matter of the soil. It is possible that, when in small quantities, the available soil phosphorus could be a limiting factor of the N-NO3 supply by these two sources. In this hypothesis, nitrogen would remain the main element limitating plant diversity but its availability would be controlled by phosphorus.", "ISSN": "0032-079X", "pub": "PLANT AND SOIL", "volume": "202", "authors": ["Janssens, F", "Peeters, A", "Tallowin, JRB", "Bakker, JP", "Bekker, RM", "Fillat, F", "Oomes, MJM"], "issue": "1", "pages": "69-78"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0024-3205(84)90016-X", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002432058490016X/pdf?md5=5fc43e3a1d31fe6c1492bd4f7742b38a&pid=1-s2.0-002432058490016X-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1984", "title": "PLASMA PROLACTIN CHANGES FOLLOWING FENFLURAMINE IN DEPRESSED-PATIENTS COMPARED TO CONTROLS - AN EVALUATION OF CENTRAL SEROTONERGIC RESPONSIVITY IN DEPRESSION", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002432058490016X", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0024-3205", "pub": "LIFE SCIENCES", "volume": "34", "authors": ["SIEVER, LJ", "MURPHY, DL", "SLATER, S", "DELAVEGA, E", "LIPPER, S"], "issue": "11", "pages": "1029-1039"}, {"DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01292.x", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 2007", "title": "Contemporary carbon balance and late Holocene carbon accumulation in a northern peatland", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01292.x/abstract;jsessionid=3E5AEC9CD3CF3DD284F2C2FE23507416.f04t01", "abstract": "Northern peatlands contain up to 25% of the world's soil carbon (C) and have an estimated annual exchange of CO2-C with the atmosphere of 0.1-0.5 Pg yr(-1) and of CH4-C of 10-25 Tg yr(-1). Despite this overall importance to the global C cycle, there have been few, if any, complete multiyear annual C balances for these ecosystems. We report a 6-year balance computed from continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), regular instantaneous measurements of methane (CH4) emissions, and export of dissolved organic C (DOC) from a northern ombrotrophic bog. From these observations, we have constructed complete seasonal and annual C balances, examined their seasonal and interannual variability, and compared the mean 6-year contemporary C exchange with the apparent C accumulation for the last 3000 years obtained from C density and age-depth profiles from two peat cores. The 6-year mean NEE-C and CH4-C exchange, and net DOC loss are -40.2 +/- 40.5 (+/- 1 SD), 3.7 +/- 0.5, and 14.9 +/- 3.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), giving a 6-year mean balance of -21.5 +/- 39.0 g m(-2) yr(-1) (where positive exchange is a loss of C from the ecosystem). NEE had the largest magnitude and variability of the components of the C balance, but DOC and CH4 had similar proportional variabilities and their inclusion is essential to resolve the C balance. There are large interseasonal and interannual ranges to the exchanges due to variations in climatic conditions. We estimate from the largest and smallest seasonal exchanges, quasi-maximum limits of the annual C balance between 50 and -105 g m(-2) yr(-1).

How are the dimensions and the symmetry of the crystallographic unit cell affected by the spin crossover? Conversely, how may structural properties influence the spin crossover behavior? Do intramolecular parameters account for the features of the spin crossover? What are the relevant characteristics of the crystal packing for the cooperativity? Do the above questions have general answers that can be used for all the spin crossover compounds? This contribution tries to give answers to these questions. The discussion is based on a large structural data set provided in the literature for the six-coordinated iron(II) mononuclear complexes of general formula [FeLn(NCS)(2)]. The effects of temperature, light and pressure on the X-ray diffraction crystal structures are reviewed. The structural modifications due to the spin crossover are first estimated, these include the expansion and the distortion of the FeN6 octahedron, the isotropic and the anisotropic changes of the unit cell. The influence of the structural properties on the features of the spin crossover is then discussed. For example, intramolecular properties such as Fe-N bond lengths are in general not relevant to account for the spin crossover features.

Soft magnetic materials are a central component of electromagnetic devices such as step motors, magnetic sensors, transformers and magnetic recording heads. Miniaturization of these devices requires materials that can develop higher saturation flux density, B-s, so that the necessary flux densities can be preserved on reducing device dimensions, while simultaneously achieving a low coercivity. Common high-B-s soft magnetic films currently in use are electroplated CoFe-based alloys(1-4), electroplated CoNiFe alloys(5-7), and sputtered Fe-based nanocrystalline(8-11) and FeN films(12-14).

Here we report the electrochemical preparation of a CoNiFe film with a very high value of B-s (2.0-2.1T) and a low coercivity. The favourable properties are achieved by avoiding the need for organic additives in the deposition process, which are typically used to reduce internal stresses. Our films also undergo very small magnetostriction, which is essential to ensure that they are not stressed when an external magnetic field is applied (or conversely, that external stresses do not disrupt the magnetic properties).

We investigated species richness in herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems, sampled along a transect through temperate Eurasia that represented a gradient of declining levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition - from similar to 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in western Europe to natural background values of less than 5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Siberia(4).

The specific surface area, the pore size distribution, the N and O contents, and the electrocatalytic activities of the 19 types of catalysts were measured. It was found that the activity of the catalysts varies greatly from one carbon support to another, but neither the specific surface area of the catalysts nor the distribution of their macro- or mesopores is a determining factor for the catalytic activity. The most important factor is the N content of the materials; the higher it is, the higher is the density of the catalytic sites on their surface and the better is the electrocatalyst. Carbon supports that are devoid of N, however, display some lower catalytic activity, which is attributed to an iron oxide. The latter catalytic site occurs also in the other N-containing catalysts.

An elevation in core temperature also was associated with exposure to d-METH, d-MDA and d-MDMA, whereas exposure to d-FEN lowered core temperature. Given these findings, we examined the effects of temperature on substituted amphetamine (AMP)-induced neurotoxicity in the C57BL/6J mouse. Levels of striatal dopamine (DA) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were taken as indicators of neurotoxicity. Alterations in ambient temperature, pretreatment with drugs reported to cause hypothermia in the mouse and hypothermia induced by restraint stress were used to affect AMP-induced neurotoxicity. Mice received d-METH (10 mg/kg), d-MDA (20 mg/kg) or d-MDMA (20 mg/kg) every 2 hr for a total of four s.c. injections. All three AMPs increased core temperature and caused large (>75%) decreases in striatal dopamine and large (>300%) increases in striatal glial fibrillary acidic protein 72 hr after the last injection. Lowering ambient temperature from 22 degrees C to 15 degrees C blocked (d-MDA and d-MDMA) or severely attenuated (d-METH) these effects.

The plant section of the DAISIE database is based on national checklists from 48 European countries/regions and Israel; for many of them the data were compiled during the project and for some countries DAISIE collected the first comprehensive checklists of alien species, based on primary data (e.g., Cyprus, Greece, R Y. R. O. Macedonia, Slovenia, Ukraine). In total, the database contains records of 5789 alien plant species in Europe (including those native to a part of Europe but alien to another part), of which 2843 are alien to Europe (of extra-European origin). The research focus was on naturalized species; there are in total 3749 naturalized aliens in Europe, of which 1780 are alien to Europe. This represents a marked increase compared to 1568 alien species reported by a previous analysis of data in Flora Europaea (1964-1980). Casual aliens were marginally considered and are represented by 1507 species with European origins and 872 species whose native range falls outside Europe. The highest diversity of alien species is concentrated in industrialized countries with a tradition of good botanical recording or intensive recent research. The highest number of all alien species, regardless of status, is reported from Belgium (1969), the United Kingdom (1779) and Czech Republic (1378). The United Kingdom (857), Germany (450), Belgium (447) and Italy (440) are countries with the most naturalized neophytes. The number of naturalized neophytes in European countries is determined mainly by the interaction of temperature and precipitation; it increases with increasing precipitation but only in climatically warm and moderately warm regions. Of the nowadays naturalized neophytes alien to Europe, 50% arrived after 1899, 25% after 1962 and 10% after 1989. At present, approximately 6.2 new species, that are capable of naturalization, are arriving each year. Most alien species have relatively restricted European distributions; half of all naturalized species occur in four or fewer countries/regions, whereas 70% of non-naturalized species occur in only one region. Alien species are drawn from 213 families, dominated by large global plant families which have a weedy tendency and have undergone major radiations in temperate regions (Asteraceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae). There are 1567 genera, which have alien members in European countries, the commonest being globally-diverse genera comprising mainly urban and agricultural weeds (e.g., Amaranthus, Chenopodium and Solanum) or cultivated for ornamental purposes (Cotoneaster, the genus richest in alien species). Only a few large genera which have successfully invaded (e.g., Oenothera, Oxalis, Panicum, Helianthus) are predominantly of non-European origin. Conyza canadensis, Helianthus tuberosus and Robinia pseudoacacia are most widely distributed alien species. Of all naturalized aliens present in Europe, 64.1% occur in industrial habitats and 58.5% on arable land and in parks and gardens. Grasslands and woodlands are also highly invaded, with 37.4 and 31.5%, respectively, of all naturalized aliens in Europe present in these habitats.\n\nMires, bogs and fens are least invaded; only approximately 10% of aliens in Euope occur there. Intentional introductions to Europe (62.8% of the total number of naturalized aliens) prevail over unintentional (37.2%). Ornamental and horticultural introductions escaped from cultivation account for the highest number of species, 52.2% of the total. Among unintentional introductions, contaminants of seed, mineral materials and other commodities are responsible for 1091 alien species introductions to Europe (76.6% of all species introduced unintentionally) and 363 species are assumed to have arrived as stowaways (directly associated with human transport but arriving independently of commodity). Most aliens in Europe have a native range in the same continent (28.6% of all donor region records are from another part of Europe where the plant is native); in terms of species numbers the contribution of Europe as a region of origin is 53.2%. Considering aliens to Europe separately, 45.8% of species have their native distribution in North and South America, 45.9% in Asia, 20.7% in Africa and 5.3% in Australasia. Based on species composition, European alien flora can be classified into five major groups: (1) north-western, comprising Scandinavia and the UK; (2) west-central, extending from Belgium and the Netherlands to Germany and Switzerland; (3) Baltic, including only the former Soviet Baltic states; (4) east-central, comprizing the remainder of central and eastern Europe; (5) southern, covering the entire Mediterranean region. The clustering patterns cut across some European bioclimatic zones; cultural factors such as regional trade links and traditional local preferences for crop, forestry and ornamental species are also important by influencing the introduced species pool. Finally, the paper evaluates a state of the art in the field of plant invasions in Europe, points to research gaps and outlines avenues of further research towards documenting alien plant invasions in Europe.

In this study we examined the relationship between species richness and biomass for 36 marsh communities from two different watersheds.  In addition, we measured several environmental variables and estimated the potential richness (the total number of species known to be able to occur in a community type) for each community.  Above-ground living and dead biomass combined was found to be weakly correlated with species richness (R2 = 0.02).  Instead, a multiple regression model based on elevation (R2 = 0.47), salinity (R2 = 0.30), soil organic matter (R2 = 0.18), and biomass was able to explain 82% of the variance in species richness.\n\nIt was found that environmental conditions could explain 89% of the variation in potential richness.  Biomass had no relation to potential richness.  When used as a predictor variable, potential richness was found to explain 72% of the variation in realized (observed) richness and biomass explained an additional 9% of the variance in realized richness.  This finding suggests that realized richness in our system was controlled primarily by environmental regulation of potential richness and secondarily by biomass (as an indicator of competition).\n\nFurther examination of the data revealed that when sites exposed to extreme environmental conditions were eliminated from the analysis, biomass became the primary predictor of realized richness and potential richness was of secondary importance.

In the drier, warmer summer conditions predicted at high latitudes by some climate models3,4 as a result of greenhouse-gas forcing, northern peatlands would become drier, increasing the rate of mineralization of organic matter1,5 and of the microbial processes that produce N2O. These regions might therefore be expected to exert a strong feedback on climate. But whereas methane emissions have been well studied6,7, little is known about the effect on N2O fluxes of changes in the level of peatland water tables. Here we present a comparison of present-day N2O fluxes from virgin peatlands in Finland with those from sites in the same regions that were drained by ditching 30 and 50 years ago. The lowered water table had no effect on N2O emissions from nutrient-poor peat but enhanced those from nutrient-rich peat. We estimate that equivalent drying caused by climate change would increase the total emissions of N2O from northern peatlands by 0.03-0.1 teragrams of nitrogen per year, which is just 0.3-1% of the present global annual emissions.

To use them, it is necessary to determine the linkage between quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and such markers. The objective of this research was to determine such linkage in recombinant inbred (RI) soybean [Glycine max (L,) Merrill] populations. To do this, RI soybean segregants were characterized for molecular genetic markers and traits measured in several different environments. QTLs then were identified by interval mapping. Agronomic traits were measured and compared in large (about 230 segregants) RI populations derived from crosses between the cultivars Minsoy and Noir 1 (MN population), Minsoy and Archer (MA population), and Noir 1 and Archer (NA population). The MA and NA populations were grown together as two replications in each of four environments, Measurements from the MN population mere reported previously and were taken from three replications grown in four environments, Traits measured were plant height, lodging, date of flowering, reproductive period, maturity, yield, seed weight, seed oil, seed protein, leaf length, and leaf width, Additional traits were derived from these primary measurements. Each of the three RI populations was also characterized by a large (>400) number of molecular genetic markers including RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and SSR (simple sequence repeat polymorphisms). QTLs were identified for all of the primary and derived traits at a significance level greater than or equal to LOD 3 on 17 of the 20 linkage groups and tended to be clustered on three. QTLs with major effects (R-2 > 10%) were identified for all traits, and for many, these explained more than half of the heritable variation. Comparison of QTLs between the three RI populations established that for the majority of the traits, only two alleles could be identified. In only a fen instances could a third allele be detected. Many of the significant QTLs identified in one population were confirmed in another.

Carer diandra, C. rostrata, and C. lasiocarpa are dominant in less productive mesotrophic fens, whereas C. acutiformis is dominant in more productive eutrophic fens. For each species, three types of litter were used: litter collected in the field (FLD); and litter from experimental populations grown at low (LN: 3.3 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)) and high N supply (HN: 20.0 g N . m(-2). yr(-1)). For all the litter chemistry parameters studied there were highly significant interactions between species and litter type. This implies that, due to differential plant-mediated controls on leaf litter chemistry, it is not always possible to predict changes in litter chemistry in response to increased nutrient supply.\n\nLitter decay was determined in a long-term (3 yr) field experiment using litter bags. The litter types of each species were incubated at their native growing sites. Contrary to what is generally found, the leaf litter decomposition rate of the species growing at the nutrient-poorest site (C. diandra) was higher than that of the species growing at the nutrient richest site (C. acutiformis). Only for C. diandra and C. lasiocarpa was the decomposition rate of the litter from the HN treatment higher than that of the field litter. Thus, increased nutrient supply does not necessarily lead to higher litter decomposition rates. Nutrient controls on litter decay changed with time: initial litter decay (less than or equal to 3 mo) was strongly controlled (high r(2) values) by all P-related litter quality parameters, whereas long-term litter decay (>1 yr) was most strongly related with the phenolics : N ratio, the phenolics : P ratio, the lignin : N ratio, and the C:N ratio. Our data suggest that high levels of atmospheric N deposition, such as in the study area (The Netherlands), may lead to a relative shortage of P in the plant-derived substrates for bacteria and fungi. As a result, P-related litter chemistry parameters exert a strong influence on litter decay.\n\nOur data did not support the hypothesis that high-nutrient species increase nutrient cycling due to the production of easily decomposable litter with high rates of nutrient release. The leaf litter from Carer acutiformis, the species from the high-productivity fens, decomposed more slowly than that of the other species, immobilized more N and P and had a longer period of net N and P immobilization. However, this species has a higher litter production than the other species and thereby increases the rate of nutrient cycling. At the intraspecific level, increased nutrient supply led to lower amounts of immobilized N and P and faster N and P release from litter in most species, and thereby to a higher rate of nutrient cycling. This positive feedback between nutrient supply rate and the rate of nutrient cycling is reinforced by the increase in litter production in response to increased nutrient supply.", "ISSN": "0012-9658", "pub": "ECOLOGY", "volume": "78", "authors": ["Aerts, R", "deCaluwe, H"], "issue": "1", "pages": "244-260"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00165-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071703001652/pdfft?md5=032f1b908b96e8488cd472be847ad395&pid=1-s2.0-S0038071703001652-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 2003", "title": "Changes in properties of soil-derived dissolved organic matter induced by biodegradation", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071703001652", "abstract": "Properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) determine its biodegradation. In turn, biodegradation changes the properties of the remaining DOM, which may be decisive for the formation of stable organic carbon in soil. To gain information on both mechanisms and controlling factors of DOM biodegradation and the properties of biodegraded DOM, we investigated changes in the composition of 13 different DOM samples extracted from maize straw, forest floors, peats, and agricultural soils during a 90-day incubation using UV absorbance, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, FTIR- spectroscopy, H-1-NMR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and C-13 natural abundance before and after incubation. Changes in the DOM properties were related to the extent of biodegradation determined by the release of CO2, Increasing UV absorption and humification indices deduced from fluorescence emission spectra. and increasing portions of aromatic H indicated relative enrichment of aromatic compounds during biodegradation. This enrichment significantly correlated with the amount of DOC mineralized suggesting that aromatic compounds were relatively stable and slowly mineralized. C-13 depletion during the incubation of highly degradable DOM solutions indicated an enrichment of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Py-FI mass spectra indicated increasing contents of phenols and lignin monomers at the expense of lignin dimers and alkylaromatics during incubation. This partial degradation of higher-molecular, lignin-derived DOM compounds was accompanied by relative increases in the proportions of lower-molecular degradation products and microbial metabolites. Carbohydrates, especially when abundant at high initial contents, seem to be the preferred substrate for microorganisms. However, four independent methods suggested also some microbial production of carbohydrates and peptides during DOM degradation. After incubation, the composition of highly degradable DOM samples became similar to relatively stable DOM samples with respect to aromaticity, carbohydrate content, and thermal stability. We conclude that DOM biodegradation seems to result in organic matter properties being a precondition for the formation of stable carbon. These structural changes induced by DOM biodegradation should also result in stronger DOM sorption to the soil matrix additionally affecting DOM stabilization. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thus, annual carbon balance must be studied in detail in order to predict the climatic responses of these ecosystems. Closed-chamber methods were used to study CO2 and CH4 in hollow, Sphagnum angustifolium lawn, S. fuscum lawn, and hummock microsites within an ombrotrophic S, fuscum bog. Micrometeorological tower measurements were used as a reference for the CH4 efflux from the bog. Low precipitation during May-August in 1994 (84 mm below the long-term average for the same period) and a warm July-August period caused the water table to drop by more than 15 cm below the peat surface in the hollows and to 48 cm below the surface in high hummocks. Increased annual total respiration exceeded gross production and resulted in a net C loss of 4-157 g/m(2) in the different microsites. Drought probably caused irreversible desiccation in some lawns of S. angustifolium and S. balticum and in S. fuscum in the hummocks, while S. balticum growing in hollows retained its moisture and even increased its photosynthetic capacity during the July-August period. Seasonal (12 May-4 October) CH4 emissions ranged from 2 g CH4-C/m(2) in drier S. fuscum hummocks and lawns to 7 and 14 g/m(2) in wetter S. angustifolium-S. balticum lawns and hollows, respectively. Aerodynamic gradient measurements at the tower showed slightly higher CH4 flux rates than the average estimates for the whole bog obtained by closed-chamber methods. Winter C efflux comprised 30 g CO2-C/m(2) and 1 g CH4-C/m(2) out of a total loss of 90 g C/m(2) on average in the bog, and there was an estimated annual loss of 7 g C/m2 by leaching. This study shows how delicately the boreal bog's C balance in different microsites depends on climatic variations, especially the distribution of precipitation. It also confirms that severe C losses can occur in boreal bogs during extended summer droughts, even in years with annual temperatures close to the long-term average and with precipitation clearly greater than the long-term average.", "ISSN": "0012-9658", "pub": "ECOLOGY", "volume": "80", "authors": ["Alm, J", "Schulman, L", "Walden, J", "Nykanen, H", "Martikainen, PJ", "Silvola, J"], "issue": "1", "pages": "161-174"}, {"DOI": "10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2170:PMCONC]2.0.CO;2", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "OCT 1999", "title": "Plant-mediated controls on nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs", "DOIlink": "http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658%281999%29080%5B2170%3APMCONC%5D2.0.CO%3B2", "abstract": "This paper reports on patterns in plant-mediated processes that determine the rate of nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs. We linked leaf-level nutrient dynamics with leaf-litter decomposition and explored how the observed patterns were reflected in nutrient cycling at the ecosystem level. Comparisons were made among growth forms (evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees, graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) and between mire types (fens and bogs). A literature review showed that the predominant growth form was more important as a determinant of leaf-level nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) than mire type (fen vs. bog). Evergreens had the highest N and P use efficiency. The growth form differences in NUE were mainly determined by differences in N and P concentrations in mature leaves and not by differences in resorption efficiency from senescing leaves. Sphagnum leaves had lower N and P concentrations than the other growth forms, but because of a lack of data on nutrient resorption efficiency the NUE of these mosses could not be calculated. Nitrogen use efficiency did not differ among fen and bog species, whereas bog species had a higher P use efficiency than fen species. However, a complete evaluation of mire-type or growth-form effects on NUE is only possible when data become available about nutrient resorption from senescing Sphagnum leaves. As leaf-level NUE is negatively correlated with leaf-litter nutrient concentrations, then is a direct link between NUE and litter decomposition rate.\n\nRates of litter decomposition of Sphagnum mosses are lower than in the other growth forms, but there is still much speculation about possible reasons. The role of litter chemistry of Sphagnum mosses (including decay inhibitors and decay-resistant compounds) in decomposition especially warrants further study. The strongly deviating nutritional ecology of Sphagnum mosses clearly distinguishes fens and bogs from other ecosystems. Moreover, N and P concentrations in mature leaves from vascular plant species from fens and bogs are in almost all cases lower and leaf-level N use efficiency is higher than in species from other ecosystems, irrespective of the growth form considered.\n\nBoth literature data and data from a comparative study on soil nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs in the United States (Maryland), The Netherlands, and Poland showed that nutrient mineralization did not differ clearly between fens and bogs. The comparative study further showed that cellulose decomposition in bogs was lower than in fens and that nutrient mineralization was higher in forested than in herbaceous mires. The occurrence of dominant growth forms was clearly related to soil nutrient-cycling processes, and observed patterns were in agreement with patterns in the components of NUE as found in the literature study.

B 106 (2002) 8705) are now characterized by RRDE experiments to determine the values of the apparent number of electron transferred (n) and the percentage of peroxide (%H2O2) released during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in H2SO4 at pH 1. A direct correlation is found between the relative abundance of the FeN2/C catalytic site in these materials, their catalytic activity and the value of n. The correlation is inverse for %H2O2. The best catalysts at their maximum catalytic activity are characterized by n > 3.9 and %H2O2 < 5%, equivalent to a value of %H2O2 released by a 2 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. It is shown that even low peroxide levels of the order of 5 vol`% in H2SO4 are able to decompose the catalytic sites releasing iron ions in the H2SO4 solution. The loss of catalytic activity correlates directly with the loss of iron ions by these catalysts. All the catalysts have been tested at the cathode of single membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). The slow decrease in performance in fuel cell stability tests is interpreted as the result of the detrimental effect that has H2O2, released during ORR, on the chemical integrity of the nonnoble metal catalytic sites at work at the fuel cell cathodes.

Absence of strong Co2+ d-d(*) transition near the optical band gap makes Zn1-xCoxO an useful material for short-wavelength magneto-optical applications. Large magneto-optical effects and paramagnetic temperature dependence of MCD show a strong mixing of the sp bands of the host ZnO with Co2+ d orbitals.

After activation, p53 migrates to mitochondria and nucleus, a response that eventually leads to apoptosis, but how the two events are related is unknown. Herein, we show that p53 translocation to mitochondria precedes its translocation to nucleus in JB6 skin epidermal cells treated with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Translocation of p53 to mitochondria occurs within 10 minutes after TPA application. In the mitochondria, p53 interacts with the primary antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), consistent with the reduction of its superoxide scavenging activity, and a subsequent decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast to the immediate action on mitochondria, p53 transcriptional activity in the nucleus increases at I hour following TPA application, accompanied by an increase in the levels of its target gene bax at 15 hours following TPA treatment. Activation of p53 transcriptional activity is preventable by application of a SOD mimetic (MnTE-2-pyp(5+),). Thus, p53 translocation to mitochondria and subsequent inactivation of MnSOD explains the observed mitochondrial dysfunction, which leads to transcription-dependent mechanisms of p53-induced apoptosis.", "ISSN": "0008-5472", "pub": "CANCER RESEARCH", "volume": "65", "authors": ["Zhao, YF", "Chaiswing, L", "Velez, JM", "Batinic-Haberle, I", "Colburn, NH", "Oberley, TD", "St Clair, DK"], "issue": "9", "pages": "3745-3750"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0891-5849(02)00980-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584902009802/pdfft?md5=22f7647e47a7919d550c8128a1e633b8&pid=1-s2.0-S0891584902009802-main.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 15 2002", "title": "A small molecular weight catalytic metalloporphyrin antioxidant with superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic properties protects lungs from radiation-induced injury", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584902009802", "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is an important therapeutic modality in the treatment of thoracic tumors. The maximum doses to these tumors are often limited by the radiation tolerance of lung tissues. Lung injury from ionizing radiation is believed to be a consequence of oxidative stress and a cascade of cytokine activity. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme in cellular defenses against oxidative damage. The objective of this study was to determine whether the SOD mimetic AEOL 10 113 [manganese (111) mesotetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin (MnTE-2-pyp(5+))] increases the tolerance of lung to ionizing radiation. AEOL 10113 was able to significantly reduce the severity of RT-induced lung injury. This was strongly supported with histopathology results and measurements of collagen deposition (hydroxyproline content). There was a significant reduction in the plasma level of the profibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the group of rats receiving RT + AEOL 10113. In conclusion, the novel SOD mimetic, AEOL 10113, demonstrates a significant protective effect from radiation-induced lung injury.

The key issue for these materials is to understand the limits between their physical properties (transport, magnetism, mechanical, etc.) and their chemical-physical structure. In principle, a detailed knowledge of the chemical and physical structures allows calculation of their physical properties. Theoretical and computational methods are rapidly evolving so that magnetic properties of nanostructured materials might soon be predicted. Success in this endeavor requires detailed quantitative understanding of magnetic structure at the microscopic level. Neutron scattering is a well-developed technique that can determine magnetic structure at the atomic length scale in samples of ever diminishing size. This has opened up the use of neutron scattering to nanostructured materials prepared by thin film and lithographic techniques. Many interesting and unexpected results have emerged from the application of elastic neutron scattering to nanostructured magnetic thin films such as superlattices and multilayers. These include, distinguishing between magnetic and chemical boundaries, observing the spatial dependence of the magnetization vector in nonuniform materials, unusual coupling mechanisms across nonmagnetic materials, unexpected magnetic phase diagrams, etc. Extension of elastic neutron scattering to nanostructured arrays and three-dimensional magnetic composites will allow future determination of magnetic structure with unprecedented resolution. In this review, we discuss the impact of neutron scattering to the study of magnetic nanostructures, i.e., magnetic materials that are artificially structured at nanometer length scales, such as magnetic thin films, multilayers and nanodot arrays. The basic interactions and different length scales relevant to these systems as well as the basic issues and phenomena of interest are briefly reviewed. We discuss examples where the techniques of magnetic neutron diffraction, small-angle scattering, reflectometry, grazing incidence diffraction and diffuse scattering have helped to elucidate some of these phenomena. We also discuss potentially fruitful future applications of such techniques to the field of nanomagnetism. Furthermore, we argue that the development of inelastic neutron scattering techniques useful for the study of small volumes of material would raise neutron scattering to a much higher level of applicability for nanostructured magnetic materials.

To determine if mitochondrial O-2(-) production was an important determinant in neuronal death resulting from OGD, metalloporphyrins with varying superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were tested for their ability to protect against mitochondrial aconitase inactivation and cell death. OGD-induced mitochondrial aconitase inactivation and cell death was inhibited by manganese tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), manganese tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2yl) porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP) and NMDA receptor antagonists. By contrast, NMDA- or kainate (KA)-induced mitochondrial aconitase inactivation and cell death was inhibited by MnTBAP, but not MnTE-2-PyP. Moreover, both MnTBAP and MnTE-2-PyP penetrated mitochondrial fractions of cortical cells.

However, the effects of genetic mutation of AD on oxidative status and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) production during neuronal development are unclear. To investigate the consequences of genetic mutation of AD on oxidative damages and production of MnSOD during neuronal development, we used primary neurons from new born wild-type (WT/WT) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (NLh/NLh) and presenilin 1 (PS1) (P264L) knock-in mice (APP/PS1) which incorporated humanized mutations in the genome. Increasing levels of oxidative damages, including protein carbonyl, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), were accompanied by a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in both developing and mature APP/PS1 neurons compared with WT/WT neurons suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction under oxidative stress. Interestingly, developing APP/PS1 neurons were significantly more resistant to beta-amyloid 1-42 treatment, whereas mature APP/PS1 neurons were more vulnerable than WT/WT neurons of the same age. Consistent with the protective function of MnSOD, developing APP/PS1 neurons have increased MnSOD protein and activity, indicating an adaptive response to oxidative stress in developing neurons. In contrast, mature APP/PS1 neurons exhibited lower MnSOD levels compared with mature WT/WT neurons indicating that mature APP/PS1 neurons lost the adaptive response. Moreover, mature APP/PS1 neurons had more colocalization of MnSOD with nitrotyrosine indicating a greater inhibition of MnSOD by nitrotyrosine. Overexpression of Mn-SOD or addition of MnTE-2-PyP5+ (SOD mimetic) protected against beta-amyloid-induced neuronal death and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. Together, the results demonstrate that compensatory induction of MnSOD in response to an early increase in oxidative stress protects developing neurons against beta-amyloid toxicity. However, continuing development of neurons under oxidative damage conditions may suppress the expression of MnSOD and enhance cell death in mature neurons. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published, by Elsevier Ltd.

This review describes most successful mitochondrially-targeted redox-active compounds, Mn porphyrins and MitoQ(10) in detail, and briefly addresses several other compounds that are either catalysts of dismutation, or its non-catalytic scavengers, and that reportedly attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction. While not a true catalyst (SOD mimic) of O-2(-) dismutation, MitoQ(10) oxidizes O-2(-) to O-2 with a high rate constant. In vivo it is readily reduced to quinol. MitoQH(2), which in turn reduces ONOO- to NO2, producing semiquinone radical that subsequently dismutes to MitoQ(10) and MitoQH(2), completing the \"catalytic\" cycle. In MitoQ(10), the redox-active unit was coupled via 10-carbon atom alkyl chain to monocationic triphenylphosphonium ion in order to reach the mitochondria. Mn porphyrin-based SOD mimics, however, were designed so that their multiple cationic charge and alkyl chains determine both their remarkable SOD potency and carry them into the mitochondria. Several animal efficacy studies such as skin carcinogenesis and UVB-mediated mtDNA damage, and subcellular distribution studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mouse heart provided unambiguous evidence that Mn porphyrins mimic the site and action of MnSOD, which in turn contributes to their efficacy in numerous in vitro and in vivo models of oxidative stress. Within a class of Mn porphyrins, lipophilic analogs are particularly effective for treating central nervous system injuries where mitochondria play key role.

The present study extends our previous studies in the MnSOD KO mice and shows that apoptosis in mouse epidermis occurred prior to cell proliferation (6 versus 24 hours) when treated with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). To investigate the possibility that a timed administration of SOD following apoptosis but before proliferation may lead to suppression of tumor incidence, we applied a SOD mimetic (MnTE-2-PyP5+) 12 hours after each TPA treatment.

The ortho cationic pyridyl nitrogens of MnTE-2-PYP5+ are essential for its high antioxidant potency. The exceptional ability of (MnTE)-T-III-2-PyP5+ to dismute O-2(.-) parallels its ability to reduce ONOO- and CO3-. Decreasing levels of these species are considered its predominant mode of action, which may also involve redox regulation of signaling pathways. Recently, Ferrer-Sueta at al. (Free Radic. BioL Med. 41:503-512; 2006) showed, with subillitochondrial particles, that >= 3 mu M (MnTE)-T-III-2-pyp(5+) was able to protect components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain frorn peroxynitrite-mediated damage. Our study complements their data in showing, for the first time that microiriolar mitochondrial concentrations of (MnTE)-T-III-2-PyP5+ are obtainable in vivo. For this study we have developed a new and sensitive method for (MnTE)-T-III-2-pyp(5+) determination in tissues. The method is based on the exchange of porphyrin Mn2+ with Zn2+ followed by the HPLC/fluorescence detection of (ZnTE)-T-II-2-Pyp(4+). At 4 and 7 h after a single 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal administration of (MnTE)-T-III-2-PyP5+, the mice (8 in total) were anesthetized and perfused with saline. Mitochondria were then isolated by the method of Mela and Seitz (Methods Enzymol. 55:39-46; 1979). We found (MnTE)-T-III-2-pyp(5+) localized in heart rnitochondria to 2.95 ng/mg protein. Given the average value of mitochondrial volume of 0.6 mu L/mg protein, the calculated (MnTE)-T-III-2-PyP5+ concentration is 5.1 mu M, which is sufficient to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage. This study establishes, for the first time, that (MnTE)-T-III-2-pyp(5+), a highly charged metalloporphyrin, is capable of entering mitochondria in vivo at levels sufficient to exert there its antioxidant action; such a result encourages its development as a prospective therapeutic agent.

The purpose of this study was to compare MnTE-2-pyp(5+) with a newly introduced analogue MnTnHex-2-pyp(5+), which is expected to be a more effective radioprotector due to its lipophilic properties. This study shows that Fischer rats which were irradiated to their right hemithorax (28 Gy) have less pulmonary injury as measured using breathing frequencies when treated with daily subcutaneous injections of MnTE-2-PYP5+ (3 and 6 mg/kg) or MnTnHex-2-PyP5+ (0.3, 0.6, or 1.0 mg/kg) for 2 weeks after RT.

We have recently reported that pure MnTBAP does not dismute superoxide, but commercial or poorly purified samples are able to perform O(2)(center dot-)dismutation with low-to-moderate efficacy via non-innocent Mn-containing impurities. Herein, we show that neither commercial nor pure MnTBAP could substitute for SOD enzyme in a SOD-deficient Escherichia coli model, whereas MnTE-2-PyP-treated SOD-deficient E. coli grew as well as a wildtype strain. This SOD-specific system indicates that MnTBAP does not act as an SOD mimic in vivo. In another model, carrageenan-induced pleurisy in mice, inflammation was evidenced by increased pleural fluid exudate and neutrophil infiltration and activation: these events were blocked by 0.3 mg/kg MnTE-2-PyP and, to a slightly lesser extent, by 10 mg/kg of either MnTBAP. Also, 3-nitrotyrosine formation, an indication of peroxynitrite existence in vivo, was blocked by both compounds; again MnTE-2-PyP was 33-fold more effective. Pleurisy model data indicate that MnTBAP exerts some protective actions in common with MnTE-2-PyP, which are not O(2)(center dot-) related and can be fully rationalized if one considers that the common biological role shared by MnTBAP and MnTE-2-PyP is related to their reduction of peroxynitrite and carbonate radical, the latter arising from ONOOCO(2) adduct. The log k(cat) (O(2)(center dot-)) value for MnTBAP is estimated to be about 3.16, which is similar to 5 and similar to 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the SOD activities of the potent SOD mimic MnTE-2-PyP and Cu,Zn-SOD, respectively. This very low value indicates that MnTBAP is too inefficient at dismuting superoxide to be of any biological impact, which was confirmed in the SOD-deficient E. coli model. The peroxynitrite scavenging ability of MnTBAP, however, is only similar to 2.5 orders of magnitude smaller than that of MnTE-2-PyP and is not significantly affected by the presence of the SOD-active impurities in the commercial MnTBAP sample (log k(red) (ONOO(-))=5.06 for pure and 4.97 for commercial sample). The reduction of carbonate radical is equally fist with MnTBAP and MnTE-2-PyP. The dose of MnTBAP required to yield oxidative stress protection and block nitrotyrosine formation in the pleurisy model is >1.5 orders of magnitude higher than that of MnTE-2-PyP, which could be related to the lower ability of MnTBAP to scavenge peroxynitrite. The slightly better protection observed with the commercial MnTBAP sample (relative to the pure MnTBAP) Could arise from its impurities, which, by scavenging O2(center dot-), reduce consequently the overall peroxynitrite and secondary ROS/RNS levels. These observations have profound biological repercussions as they may suggest that the effect of MnTBAP observed in numerous studies may conceivably relate to peroxynitrite scavenging. Moreover, provided that pure MnTBAP is unable to dismute superoxide at any significant extent, but is able to partially scavenge peroxynitrite and carbonate radical, this compound may prove valuable in distinguishing ONOO/CO(3) from O(2) pathways.

The hydroxychalcone (2'-HC) and the dilrydroxychalcones (2',2-, 2',3-, 2,4-, and 2',5-DHC) were the most effective in A549 and HL-60 cells, depleting more than 50% of intracellular GSH within 4 h of exposure at 25 mu M. In contrast, the flavones chrysin and apigenin were the most effective in PC-3 cells, depleting 50-70% of intracellular GSH within 24 h of exposure at 25 mu M. In general, these flavonoids were more effective than three classical substrates of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MK-571, indomethacin, and verapamil). Prototypic flavonoids (2',5-DHC and chrysin) were subsequently tested for their abilities to potentiate the toxicities of prooxidants (etoposide, rotenone, 2-methoxyestradiol, and curcumin). In A549 cells, 2',5'-DHC potentiated the cytotoxicities of rotenone, 2-methoxyestradiol, and curcumin, but not etoposide. In HL-60 and PC-3 cells, chrysin potentiated the cytotoxicity of curcumin, cytotoxicity that was attenuated by the catalytic antioxidant manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP). Assessments of mitochondrial GSH levels mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release showed that the potentiation effects induced by 2,5'-DHC and chrysin involve mitochondrial dysfunction.

The composition homogeneity of the large single crystals of the ternary compound seems to be easier to achieve in the case of (Cd,Mn)Te because the segregation coefficient of Mn in CdTe is negligible with respect to that (approx. 1.3) of Zn. Only 15% of MnTe has to be added to CdTe to reach the best for the detector application value of the energy gap (in the range 1.7 - 2.2 eV), while the necessary amount of ZnTe is over 30%! This is because the composition dependence of the CdTe energy gap is for Mn twice as strong as for Zn. Using a smaller amount of the second cation diminishes many alloying-related problems. Dopant-free as grown (Cd,Mn)Te crystals are of p-type, which is related to the Cd vacancies acting as acceptors. The number of vacancies can be reduced by the post-growth annealing in the Cd vapours and the high (similar to 10(10) Omega cm) resistivity, required for good detectors, can be obtained by doping with donors. The technology of the (Cd,Mn)Te crystals, undoped and compensated in the very large range of concentrations, and Cd-annealing of the samples is discussed. Characterization of the obtained crystals is described. The behaviour of the preliminary detectors is shown. (c) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The reduced manganese porphyrin has been previously shown to react rapidly with superoxide and carbonate radical anion. Herein, we describe the reaction of a reduced manganese porphyrin with peroxynitrite that proceeds as a two-electron process, has a rate constant greater than 7 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) (at pH 7.25 and 37 degrees C), and produces nitrite and the Mn(IV)Porphyrin. The Mn(II)/Mn(IV) redox cycle was used to divert peroxynitrite from the inactivation of succinate dehydrogenase. In a typical experiment, 5 mu M MnTE-2-PyP in the presence of excess succinate was able to protect the succinate dehydrogenase and succinate oxidase activities of submitochondrial particles challenged with a cumulative dose of 140 mu M peroxynitrite infused in the course of 2 h. Other MnPorphyrins that are reduced more slowly do not provide as much protection underscoring the rate limiting character of the reduction step. The data presented here serve to rationalize the pharmacological action of MnPorphyrins as peroxynitrite reduction catalysis in vivo and opens avenues for the development of MnPorphyrins to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage.

Superoxide is the major species involved in oxidative stress either in its own right or through its progeny, such as ONOO-, H2O2, (OH)-O-center dot, CO3 center dot-, and (NO2)-N-center dot. Hence, the very first compounds developed in the late 1970-ies were the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics. Thus far the most potent mimics have been the cationic meso Mn(III) N-substituted pyridylporphyrins and N,N'-disubstituted imidazolylporphyrins (MnPs), some of them with k(cat)(O-2(center dot-)) similar to the k(cat) of SOD enzymes. Most frequently studied are ortho isomers MnTE-2-PyP5+, MnTnHex-2-PyP5+, and MnTDE-2-ImP(5+). The ability to disproportionate O-2(center dot-) parallels their ability to remove the other major oxidizing species, peroxynitrite, ONOO-. The same structural feature that gives rise to the high k(cat)(O-2(center dot-)) and k(red)(ONOO-), allows MnPs to strongly impact the activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors, HIF-1 alpha, NF-kappa B, AP-1, and SP-1, and therefore modify the excessive inflammatory and immune responses. Coupling with cellular reductants and other redox-active endogenous proteins seems to be involved in the actions of Mn porphyrins.\n\nWhile hydrophilic analogues, such as MnTE-2-PyP5+ and MnTDE-2-ImP(5+) are potent in numerous animal models of diseases, the lipophilic analogues, such as MnTnHex-2-PyP5+, were developed to cross blood brain barrier and target central nervous system and critical cellular compartments, mitochondria. The modification of its structure, aimed to preserve the SOD-like potency and lipophilicity, and diminish the toxicity, has presently been pursued.

Next, tumors were treated with radiation and MnTE-2-PYP5+ in vivo, and the effects on tumor growth and vascularity were monitored.\n\nResults: In vitro, MnTE-2-PyP5+ was not significantly cytotoxic. However, at concentrations as low as 2 mu mol/L it caused 100% inhibition of secretion by tumor cells of cytokines protective of irradiated endothelial cells. In vivo, combined treatment with radiation and MnTE-2-PyP5+ achieved synergistic tumor devascularization, reducing vascular density by 78.7% within 72 h of radiotherapy (p < 0.05 vs. radiation or drug alone). Co-treatment of tumors also resulted in synergistic antitumor effects, extending tumor growth delay by 9 days (p < 0.01).\n\nConclusions: These studies support the conclusion that MnTE-2-PyP5+, which has been shown to protect normal tissues from radiation injury, can also improve tumor control through augmenting radiation-induced damage to the tumor vasculature.

It therefore not only attenuates primary oxidative damage, but was found to modulate redox-based signaling pathways (HIF-1 alpha, NF-kappa B, SP-1, and AP-1) and thus, in turn, secondary oxidative injury also. Cancer has been widely considered an oxidative stress condition. The goal of this study was to prove if and why a catalytic SOD mimic/peroxynitrite scavenger would exert anti-cancer effects, i.e., to evaluate whether the attenuation of the oxidative stress by MnTE-2-PyP5+ could suppress tumor growth in a 4T1 mouse breast tumor model. Tumor cells were implanted into Balb/C mouse flanks. Three groups of mice (n=25) were studied: control (PBS) and 2 and 15 mg/kg/day of MnTE-2-PyP5+ given subcutaneously twice daily starting when the tumors averaged 200 mm(3) (until they reached similar to 5-fold the initial volume). Intratumoral hypoxia (pimonidazole, carbonic anhydrase), HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, proliferating capillary index (CD105), microvessel density (CD31), protein nitration, DNA oxidation (8-OHdG), NADPH oxidase (Nox-4), apoptosis (CD31), macrophage infiltration (CD68), and tumor drug levels were assessed. With 2 mg/kg/day a trend toward tumor growth delay was observed, and a significant trend was observed with 15 mg/kg/day. The 7.5-fold increase in drug dose was accompanied by a similar (6-fold) increase in tumor drug levels. Oxidative stress was largely attenuated as observed through the decreased levels of DNA damage, protein 3-nitrotyrosine, macrophage infiltration, and NADPH oxidase. Further, hypoxia was significantly decreased as were the levels of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF. Consequently, suppression of angiogenesis was observed; both the microvessel density and the endothelial cell proliferation were markedly decreased. Our study indicates for the first time that MnTE-2-PyP5+ has anti-cancer activity in its own right. The anti-cancer activity via HIF/VEGF pathways probably arises from the impact of the drug on the oxidative stress. Therefore, the catalytic scavenging of ROS/RNS by antioxidants, which in turn suppresses cellular transcriptional activity, could be an appropriate strategy for anti-cancer therapy. Enhancement of the anti-cancer effects may be achieved by optimizing the dosing regime, utilizing more bioavailable Mn porphyrins (MnP), and combining MnP treatment with irradiation, hyperthermia, and chemotherapy. Mn porphyrins may be advantageous compared to other anti-cancer drugs, owing to their radioprotection of normal tissue and the ability to afford pain management in cancer patients via prevention of chronic morphine tolerance.

Oxidative stress of mitochondrial origin is readily detectable, as the inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A markedly increase superoxide levels with no effect on cytoplasmic-free Ca2+. The potent cell-permeant superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic manganese tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2yl) porphyrin, MnTE-PyP, abolishes the deregulation-related increase in superoxide but has no effect on deregulation itself. A combination of catalase with the free radical scavenger 4-hydroxy-TEMPO also fails to reduce deregulation. Following the loss of Ca2+ homeostasis nuclei undergo condensation; this morphological change is not inhibited by MnTE-PyP and cannot account for the increased ethidium fluorescence. Phospholipase A(2) inhibitors decrease the deregulation-related increase in superoxide without protecting against deregulation. In conclusion, our study indicates that deregulation is not caused by NMDA receptor-mediated oxidative stress as NMDA receptor activation does not increase superoxide levels until the onset of deregulation.

In addition to their intrinsic antioxidant capacity, bioavailability plays a major role in their in vivo efficacy. Although of identical antioxidant capacity, lipophilic MnTnHex-2-PyP is up to 120-fold more efficient in reducing oxidative stress injuries than hydrophilic MnTE-2-PyP. Owing to limitations of an analytical nature, porphyrin lipophilicity has been often estimated by the thin-layer chromatographic R(f) parameter, instead of the standard n-octanol/water partition coefficient, P(OW). Herein we used a new methodological approach to finally describe the MnP lipophilicity, using the conventional log P(OW) means, for a series of biologically active ortho and meta isomers of Mn(III) N-alkylpyridylporphyrins. Three new porphyrins (MnTnBu-3-PyP, MnTnHex-3-PyP, and MnTnHep-2-PyP) were synthesized to strengthen the conclusions. The log P(OW) was linearly related to R(f) and to the number of carbons in the alkyl chain (n(C)) for both isomer series, the meta isomers being 10-fold more lipophilic than the analogous ortho porphyrins. Increasing the length of the alkyl chain by one carbon atom increases the log P(OW) value similar to 1 log unit with both isomers. Dramatic similar to 4 and similar to 5 orders of magnitude increases in the lipophilicity of the ortho isomers, by extending the pyridyl alkyl chains from two (MnTE-2-PyP, log P(OW)=-6.89) to six (MnTnHex-2-PyP, log P(OW)=-2.76) and eight carbon atoms (MnTnOct-2-PyP, log P(OW)=-1.24), parallels the increased efficacy in several oxidative-stress injury models, particularly those of the central nervous system, in which transport across the blood-brain barrier is critical. Although meta isomers are only slightly less potent SOD mimics and antioxidants than their ortho analogues, their higher lipophilicity and smaller bulkiness may lead to a higher cellular uptake and overall similar effectiveness in vivo.

MnTnOct-2-PyP5+, the more lipophilic compound, was the most effective in protecting LDL lipids, while MnTCpp3- exerted the lesser protection. Mn(Ill)porphyrins react fast with PN (similar to10(5)-10(7) M-1 S-1) to yield a O=Mn(IV) complex. The stoichiometry of uric acid consumption was similar to1.7 moles per mol of PN, in agreement with reactions with both the O=Mn(IV) complex and nitrogen dioxide. A shift from an anti- to a pro-oxidant action of the Mn(III)porphyrin was observed after uric acid was significantly consumed, supporting competition reactions between LDL targets and uric acid for the O=Mn(IV) complex. Overall, the data is consistent with the catalytic reduction of PN in a cycle that involves a one electron oxidation of Mn(III) to Mn(IV) by PN followed by the reduction back to Mn(III) by uric acid. These antioxidant effects should predominate under in vivo conditions having plasma uric acid concentration range between 150 and 500 muM.

This suggests the possibility that increasing H(2)O(2) sensitivity could sensitize the cells to glucocorticoids. In other cell types, increasing manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) can increase intracellular H(2)O(2). The current study showed that increased expression of MnSOD sensitized WERI7.2 cells to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and H(2)O(2). Treatment of WEHI7.2 cells with the catalytic antioxidant Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP(5+)), a manganoporphyrin, mimicked the effects of increased MnSOD expression.

Peroxynitrite-mediated nitroxidative stress in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays a critical role in the induction and development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine. This provides a valid pharmacological basis for developing peroxynitrite scavengers as potent adjuncts to opiates in the management of pain. The cationic Mn(III) ortho-N-alkylpyridylporphyrins MnTE-2-PyP(5+) and MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+) are among the most potent peroxynitrite scavengers, with nearly identical scavenging rate constants (similar to 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)). Yet, MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+) is significantly more lipophilic and more bioavailable and, in turn, was 30-fold more effective in blocking the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance than MnTE-2-PyP(5+) using the hot-plate test in a well-characterized murine model. The hydrophilic MnTE-2-PyP(5+) and the lipophilic MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+) were 10- and 300-fold, respectively, more effective in inhibiting morphine tolerance than the hydrophilic Fe(Ill) porphyrin FeTM-4-PyP(5+). Both Mn porphyrins decreased levels of TNF-alpha., IL-1 beta, and IL-6 to normal values. Neither of them affected acute morphine antinociceptive effects nor caused motor function impairment. Also neither was able to reverse already established morphine tolerance. We have recently shown that the anionic porphyrin Mn(III) tetrakis(4-carboxylatophenyl) porphyrin is selective in removing ONOO(-) over O2(-), but at similar to 2 orders of magnitude lower efficacy than MnTE-2-PyP(5+) and MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+), which in turn parallels up to 100-fold lower ability to reverse morphine tolerance. These data (1) support the role of peroxynitrite rather than superoxide as a major mechanism in blocking the development of morphine tolerance and (2) show that lipophilicity is a critical parameter in enhancing the potency of such novel peroxynitrite scavengers.

We find that BRCA1, the BLM helicase, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex colocalize to large nuclear foci that contain PCNA when cells are treated with agents that interfere with DNA synthesis. The association of BRCA1 with MSH2 and MSH6, which are required for transcription-coupled repair, provides a possible explanation for the role of BRCA1 in this pathway. Strikingly, all members of this complex have roles in recognition of abnormal DNA structures or damaged DNA, suggesting that BASC may serve as a sensor for DNA damage.

Ceramics made of cubic boron nitride prepared at high pressure and temperature find many applications whereas thin films prepared by activated deposition from the gas phase are still in the stage of fundamental development.

The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs(5,6), whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks(3,7). Here, because of the similarities between AT and NBS, we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95/nbs1. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation.

The MRN complex, whose core contains the Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 proteins, is involved in the initial processing of DSBs.

Here we identify a novel BRCA1 carboxy-terminal (BRCT) and forkhead-associated (FHA) domain-containing protein, MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1), which works with H2AX to promote recruitment of repair proteins to the sites of DNA breaks and which, in addition, controls damage-induced cell-cycle arrest checkpoints. MDC1 forms foci that co-localize extensively with gamma-H2AX foci within minutes after exposure to ionizing radiation. H2AX is required for MDC1 foci formation, and MDC1 forms complexes with phosphorylated H2AX. Furthermore, this interaction is phosphorylation dependent as peptides containing the phosphorylated site on H2AX bind MDC1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We have shown by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) that cells lacking MDC1 are sensitive to ionizing radiation, and that MDC1 controls the formation of damage-induced 53BP1, BRCA1 and MRN foci, in part by promoting efficient H2AX phosphorylation. In addition, cells lacking MDC1 also fail to activate the intra-S phase and G2/M phase cell-cycle checkpoints properly after exposure to ionizing radiation, which was associated with an inability to regulate Chk1 properly.

Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53, including those generated by ionising radiation (IR), radio-mimetic drugs, ultraviolet Light (UV) and chemicals such as methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Under normal conditions, p53 levels are maintained at a low state by virtue of the extremely short-half life of the polypeptide. In addition to this, p53 normally exists in an largely inactive state that is relatively inefficient at binding to DNA and activating transcription. Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage is associated with a rapid increase in its levels and with an increased ability of p53 to bind DNA and mediate transcriptional activation. This then leads to the activation of a number of genes whose products trigger cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or DNA repair. Recent work has suggested that this regulation is brought about largely through DNA damage triggering a series of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and acetylation events on the p53 polypeptide, Here, we discuss the nature of these modifications, the enzymes that bring them about, and how changes in p53 modification lead to p53 activation.", "ISSN": "0950-9232", "pub": "ONCOGENE", "volume": "18", "authors": ["Lakin, ND", "Jackson, SP"], "issue": "53", "pages": "7644-7655"}, {"DOI": "10.1126/science.285.5428.747", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/285/5428/747.full.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL 30 1999", "title": "Association of BRCA1 with the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex and the DNA damage response", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/285/5428/747", "abstract": "BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familiar breast and ovarian cancers.

Telomere NHEJ occurs upon loss of TRF2, a telomeric protein implicated in t-loop formation. Here we describe a mutant allele of TRF2, TRF2(DeltaB), that suppressed NHEJ but induced catastrophic deletions of telomeric DNA. The deletion events were stochastic and occurred rapidly, generating dramatically shortened telomeres that were accompanied by a DNA damage response and induction of senescence. TRF2(DeltaB)-induced deletions depended on XRCC3, a protein implicated in Holliday junction resolution, and created t-loop-sized telomeric circles. These telomeric circles were also detected in unperturbed cells and suggested that t-loop deletion by homologous recombination (HR) might contribute to telomere attrition. Human ALT cells had abundant-telomeric circles, pointing to frequent t-loop HR events that could promote rolling circle replication of telomeres in the absence of telomerase.

In HCT116 human carcinoma cells exposed to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, the resulting gammaH2AX formation can be prevented with the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-related kinase inhibitor wortmannin; however, in contrast to ionizing radiation, only camptothecin-induced gammaH2AX formation can be prevented with the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin and enhanced with the checkpoint abrogator 7-hydroxystaurosporine. This gammaH2AX formation is suppressed in ATR ( ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) deficient cells and markedly decreased in DNA-dependent protein kinase-deficient cells but is not abrogated in ataxia telangiectasia cells, indicating that ATR and DNA-dependent protein kinase are the kinases primarily involved in gammaH2AX formation at the sites of replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks. Mre11- and Nbs1-deficient cells are still able to form gammaH2AX.

We investigate the bulk electronic and physical properties of a series of early transition metal mononitrides, namely, those formed with 3d metals (ScN, TiN, VN), 4d metals (YN, ZrN, NbN), and 5d metals (LaN, HfN, TaN) in the rocksalt structure. In particular, lattice constants, bulk moduli, heats of formation, and cohesive energies as well as bulk band structures and densities of states are reported, and trends discussed. We find that the GGA yields 1%-2% larger lattice constants, 10%-20% smaller bulk moduli, and 10%-30% lower heats of formation compared to the LDA. The GGA slightly overestimates lattice constants, but leads overall to an improved agreement with experiment compared to the LDA, for which the values rue too small. These materials are metallic with the exception of ScN, YN, and LaN, which appear to be semimetals within the LDA (and GCA), but are in fact semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 1.58, 0.85, and 0.75 eV, respectively, as revealed by calculations performed using the screened-exchange LDA approach.

MRN is among the earliest respondents to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and MRN mutations cause the human cancer predisposition diseases Nijmegen breakage syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD). MRN's 3-protein multidomain composition promotes its central architectural, structural, enzymatic, sensing, and signaling functions in DSB responses. To organize the MRN complex, the Mre 11 exonuclease directly binds Nbs 1, DNA, and Rad50. Rad50, a structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) related protein, employs its ATP-binding cassette (ABC) ATPase, Zn hook, and coiled coils to bridge DSBs and facilitate DNA end processing by Mre 11. Contributing to MRN regulatory roles, Nbs I harbors N-terminal phosphopeptide interacting FHA and BRCT domains, as well as C-terminal ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and Mre I I interaction domains. Current emerging structural and biological evidence suggests that MRN has 3 coupled critical roles in DSB sensing, stabilization, signaling, and effector scaffolding: (1) expeditious establishment of protein - nucleic acid tethering scaffolds for the recognition and stabilization of DSBs; (2) initiation of DSB sensing, cell-cycle checkpoint signaling cascades, and establishment of epigenetic marks via the ATM kinase; and (3) functional regulation of chromatin remodeling in the vicinity of a DSB.", "ISSN": "0829-8211", "pub": "BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY-BIOCHIMIE ET BIOLOGIE CELLULAIRE", "volume": "85", "authors": ["Williams, RS", "Williams, JS", "Tainer, JA"], "issue": "4", "pages": "509-520"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.dnarep.2004.03.014", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568786404000734/pdfft?md5=e01aea7c5a1fd7ac502eaf6ad6522607&pid=1-s2.0-S1568786404000734-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG-SEP 2004", "title": "The Mre11 complex and the metabolism of chromosome breaks: the importance of communicating and holding things together", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568786404000734", "abstract": "The conserved Mre11 complex (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) plays a role in each aspect of chromosome break metabolism.

In addition, the Mre11 complex influences recombinational DNA repair through promoting recombination between sister chromatids. The Mre11 complex is required for mammalian cell viability but hypomorphic Mutants of Mre11 and Nbs1 have been identified in human genetic instability disorders. These hypomorphic mutations, as well as those identified in yeast, have provided a benchmark for establishing mouse models of Mre11 complex deficiency.

The current picture of break metabolism Supports a central role for the Mre11 complex at the interface of chromosome stability and the regulation of cell growth. Further genetic analysis of the Mre11 complex will be an invaluable tool for dissecting its function on an organismal level and determining its role in the prevention of malignancy.

The checkpoint functions of ATR and ATM are mediated, in part, by a pair of checkpoint effector kinases termed Chk1 and Chk2. In mammalian cells, evidence has been presented that Chk1 is devoted to the ATR signaling pathway and is modified by ATR in response to replication inhibition and UV-induced damage, whereas Chk2 functions primarily through ATM in response to ionizing radiation (IR), suggesting that Chk2 and Chk1 might have evolved to channel the DNA damage signal from ATM and ATR, respectively. We demonstrate here that the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways are not parallel branches of the DNA damage response pathway but instead show a high degree of cross-talk and connectivity. ATM does in fact signal to Chk1 in response to IR. Phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 in response to IR is ATM-dependent. We also show that functional NBS1 is required for phosphorylation of Chk1, indicating that NES1 might facilitate the access of Chk1 to ATM at the sites of DNA damage. Abrogation of Chk1 expression by RNA interference resulted in defects in IR-induced S and G2/M phase checkpoints; however, the overexpression of phosphorylation site mutant (S317A, S345A or S317A/S345A double mutant) Chk1 failed to interfere with these checkpoints. Surprisingly, the kinase-dead Chk1 (D130A) also failed to abrogate the S and G2 checkpoint through any obvious dominant negative effect toward endogenous Chk1. Therefore, further studies will be required to assess the contribution made by phosphorylation events to Chk1 regulation. Overall, the data presented in the study challenge the model in which Chk1 only functions downstream from ATR and indicate that ATM does signal to Chk1. In addition, this study also demonstrates that Chk1 is essential for IR-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and the G2/M checkpoint.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "278", "authors": ["Gatei, M", "Sloper, K", "Sorensen, C", "Syljuasen, R", "Falck, J", "Hobson, K", "Savage, K", "Lukas, J", "Zhou, BB", "Bartek, J", "Khanna, KK"], "issue": "17", "pages": "14806-14811"}]], [{"volume": 81.46304037985671, "formation_energy_per_atom": -0.032046838189654814, "band_gap": 0.0, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

We apply all-electron and pseudopotential ab initio methods to investigate the electronic and structural properties of ZB Mn and Cr pnictides and carbides, and find six compounds to be half metallic at or near their respective equilibrium lattice constants, making them excellent candidates for growth at low strain. Based on these findings, we further propose substrates on which the growth may be accomplished with minimum strain. Our findings are supported by the recent successful synthesis of ZB CrAs on GaAs and ZB CrSb on GaSb, where our predicted equilibrium lattice constants are within 0.5% of the lattice constants of the substrates on which the growth was accomplished. We confirm previous theoretical results for ZB MnAs, but find ZB MnSb to be half metallic at its equilibrium lattice constant, whereas previous work has found it to be only nearly so. We report here two low-strain half metallic ZB compounds, CrP and MnC, and suggest appropriate substrates for each. Unlike the other five compounds, we predict ZB MnC to become/remain half metallic with compression rather than expansion, and to exhibit metallicity in the minority- rather than majority-spin channel. These fundamentally different properties of MnC can be connected to substantially greater p-d hybridization and d-d overlap, and correspondingly larger bonding-antibonding splitting and smaller exchange splitting.

Our results show that this potential does not yield visible changes in wide TM d-t(2g) bands near the Fermi level, but makes the occupied minority-spin p-bands lower by 0.25-0.35 eV and the empty (or nearly empty) minority-spin e(g) bands across the Fermi level higher by 0.33-0.73 eV. Consequently, mBJLDA, having no atom-dependent parameters, makes zincblende MnAs become a truly half-metallic (HM) ferromagnet with a HM gap (the key parameter) 0.318 eV, being consistent with experiment. For zincblende MnSb, CrAs, CrSb, CrSe, or CrTe, the HM gap is enhanced by 19-56% compared to LDA and generalized gradient approximation results. The improved HM ferromagnetism can be understood in terms of the mBJLDA-enhanced spin exchange splitting.

We find that band-structure theory, based on density-functional theory in the local spin-density approximation, explains the measured Kerr effect of MnBi very well. A giant Kerr rotation of about - 1.75 degrees at 1.8 eV photon energy is given by our ab initio calculations, in accordance with recent experiments. A second peak at 3.4 eV in the Kerr rotation spectrum, however, comes out smaller in our calculations than what was recently measured. It is discussed that this can be due to the Mn-Bi stoichiometry. The microscopic origin of the giant Kerr effect in MnBi is analyzed in detail. We find that the huge Kerr effect in MnBi is caused by the combination of a sizeable magnetic moment of 3.7 mu(B) on manganese, the large spin-orbit coupling of bismuth, and a strong hybridization between the manganese d bands and the bismuth p states. The magneto-optically active states are mainly the p states of Bi. We pay further attention to the experimentally observed unusual temperature dependence of the MnBi Kerr spectra. We show that the observed temperature dependence can be explained by the reduction of the magnetic moment and the average lifetime with increasing temperature. The ab initio calculated Kerr effect in MnBi is furthermore compared to that calculated for the isoelectronic compounds MnAs and MnSb, and that of CrBi, CrTe, and Mn2Bi.

The coalescence among the dots can be correlated with the sharp increase of the magnetic circular dichroism intensity. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

RTGs have been successfully used to power a number of space missions and have demonstrated their reliability over an extended period of time (tens of years) and are compact, rugged, radiation resistant, scalable, and produce no noise, vibration or torque during operation. System conversion efficiency for state-of-practice RTGs is about 6% and specific power a parts per thousand currency sign5.1 W/kg. A higher specific power would result in more onboard power for the same RTG mass, or less RTG mass for the same onboard power. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been leading, under the advanced thermoelectric converter (ATEC) project, the development of new high-temperature thermoelectric materials and components for integration into advanced, more efficient RTGs. Thermoelectric materials investigated to date include skutterudites, the Yb(14)MnSb(11) compound, and SiGe alloys. The development of long-lived thermoelectric couples based on some of these materials has been initiated and is assisted by a thermomechanical stress analysis to ensure that all stresses under both fabrication and operation conditions will be within yield limits for those materials. Several physical parameters are needed as input to this analysis. Among those parameters, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is critically important. Thermal expansion coefficient measurements of several thermoelectric materials under consideration for ATEC are described in this paper. The stress response at the interfaces in material stacks subjected to changes in temperature is discussed, drawing on work from the literature and project-specific tools developed here.

Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-T(c) compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type.

These chloride-bridged dimers react with acetyl acetone (acacH) and other bidentate, monoanionic ligands such as picolinic acid (picH) and N-methylsalicylimine (salH)\\ to give monomeric C boolean ANDN(2)Ir(LX) complexes (LX = acac, pie, sal). The emission spectra of these complexes are largely governed by the nature of the cyclometalating ligand, leading to lambda (max) values from 510 to 606 nm for the complexes reported here. The strong spin-orbit coupling of iridium mixes the formally forbidden (MLCT)-M-3 and 3 pi-pi* transitions with the allowed (MLCT)-M-1, leading to a strong phosphorescence with good quantum efficiencies (0.1-0.4) and room temperature lifetimes in the microsecond regime.

A broad review of the invasion literature implies at least eight non-exclusive explanations for this enigma. In addition, we argue that the ERH has often been accepted uncritically wherever (i) NIS often appear larger, more fecund, or somehow 'better' than either congeners in the introduced region, or conspecifics in the native range; and (ii) known enemies are conspicuously absent from the introduced range.

Most of these NIS invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. Although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for NIS transfer today, and many recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. The rate of new invasions may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. Estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of NIS per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. We now know of approximately 400 NIS along the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S., and hundreds of marine and estuarine NIS are reported from other regions of the world. Although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of NIS invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of NIS among sites. Mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of NIS, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities, but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. Although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that NIS are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. Taxonomically diverse NIS are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes.

This problem is particularly acute in studies of nonindigenous species, which alternatively have been called 'exotic', 'introduced', 'invasive' and 'naturalised', among others. Attempts to redefine commonly used terminology have proven difficult because authors are often partial to particular definitions. In an attempt to form a consensus on invasion terminology, we synthesize an invasional framework based on current models that break the invasion process into a series of consecutive, obligatory stages. Unlike previous efforts, we propose a neutral terminology based on this framework. This 'stage-based' terminology can be used to supplement terms with ambiguous meanings (e.g. invasive, introduced, naturalized, weedy, etc.), and thereby improve clarity of future studies. This approach is based on the concept of 'propagule pressure' and has the additional benefit of identifying factors affecting the success of species at each stage. Under this framework, invasions can be more objectively understood as biogeographical, rather than taxonomic, phenomena; and author preferences in the use of existing terminology can be addressed. An example of this recommended protocol might be: 'We examined distribution data to contrast the characteristics of invasive species (stages IVa and V) and noninvasive species (stages III and IVb)'.", "ISSN": "1366-9516", "pub": "DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS", "volume": "10", "authors": ["Colautti, RI", "MacIsaac, HJ"], "issue": "2", "pages": "135-141"}, {"DOI": "10.1093/hmg/10.14.1511", "pdflink": "http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/14/1511.full.pdf+html", "pubDate": "JUL 1 2001", "title": "Over-expression of inducible HSP70 chaperone suppresses neuropathology and improves motor function in SCA1 mice", "DOIlink": "http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/14/1511", "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by gain-of-function mechanisms in which the disease-causing protein is altered, becomes toxic to the cell, and aggregates.

In SCA1 and several other polyglutamine diseases, the expanded protein aggregates into nuclear inclusions (NIs).

Physical compartmentation from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things, hence inorganic matter with such attributes would be life's most likely forebear. We propose that life evolved in structured iron monosulphide precipitates in a seepage site hydrothermal mound at a redox, pH and temperature gradient between sulphide-rich hydrothermal fluid and iron(II)-containing waters of the Hadean ocean floor. The naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. The known capability of FeS and NiS to catalyse the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments, which furthermore restrained reacted products from diffusion into the ocean, providing sufficient concentrations of reactants to forge the transition from geochemistry to biochemistry. The chemistry of what is known as the RNA-world could have taken place within these naturally forming, catalytic-walled compartments to give rise to replicating systems. Sufficient concentrations of precursors to support replication would have been synthesized in situ geochemically and biogeochemically, with FeS (and NiS) centres playing the central catalytic role. The universal ancestor we infer was not a free-living cell, but rather was confined to the naturally chemiosmotic, FeS compartments within which the synthesis of its constituents occurred. The first free-living cells are suggested to have been eubacterial and archaebacterial chemoautotrophs that emerged more than 3.8 Gyr ago from their inorganic confines. We propose that the emergence of these prokaryotic lineages from inorganic confines occurred independently, facilitated by the independent origins of membrane-lipid biosynthesis: isoprenoid ether membranes in the archaebacterial and fatty acid ester membranes in the eubacterial lineage. The eukaryotes, all of which are ancestrally heterotrophs and possess eubacterial lipids, are suggested to have arisen ca. 2 Gyr ago through symbiosis involving an autotrophic archaebacterial host and a heterotrophic eubacterial symbiont, the common ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The attributes shared by all prokaryotes are viewed as inheritances from their confined universal ancestor. The attributes that distinguish eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet are uniform within the groups, are viewed as relics of their phase of differentiation after divergence from the non-free-living universal ancestor and before the origin of the free-living chemoautotrophic lifestyle. The attributes shared by eukaryotes with eubacteria and archaebacteria, respectively, are viewed as inheritances via symbiosis. The attributes unique to eukaryotes are viewed as inventions specific to their lineage. The origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system and nuclear membrane are suggested to be the fortuitous result of the expression of genes for eubacterial membrane lipid synthesis by an archaebacterial genetic apparatus in a compartment that was not fully prepared to accommodate such compounds, resulting in vesicles of eubacterial lipids that accumulated in the cytosol around their site of synthesis.\n\nUnder these premises, the most ancient divide in the living world is that between eubacteria and archaebacteria, yet the steepest evolutionary grade is that between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.", "ISSN": "0962-8436", "pub": "PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "volume": "358", "authors": ["Martin, W", "Russell, MJ"], "issue": "1429", "pages": "59-83"}, {"DOI": "10.1172/JCI118798", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "JUL 15 1996", "title": "Mitochondrial complex I deficiency leads to increased production of superoxide radicals and induction of superoxide dismutase", "DOIlink": "http://www.jci.org/articles/view/118798", "abstract": "Mitochondria were isolated from skin fibroblast cultures derived from healthy individuals (controls) and from a group patients with complex I(NADH-CoQ reductase) deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Production of superoxide radicals, on addition of NADH, were measured using the luminometric probe lucigenin with isolated fibroblast mitochondrial membranes.

However, the observed superoxide production rates are modulated by the variant induction of MnSOD which decreases the rates, sometimes below those seen in control fibroblast mitochondria.

Research over the last decade, however, has shown that chemokine receptors are not restricted to leukocytes. In the brain, chemokine receptors are not only found in microglia (a brain macrophage), but also in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. In this review, we describe the spatial and cellular distribution of chemokine receptors in the brain, distinguishing between constitutively and inducibly expressed receptors. We then discuss possible physiological functions, including neuronal migration, cell proliferation and synaptic activity. Evidence is emerging that chemokine receptors are also involved in neuronal death and hence neurodegenerative diseases. Chemokines may induce neuronal death either indirectly (e.g. through activation of microglia killing mechanisms) or directly through activation of neuronal chemokine receptors. Disease processes in which chemokines and their receptors are likely to be involved include multiple sclerosis (NIS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and cerebral ischemic disease. The study of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) is not only relevant for the understanding of brain physiology and pathophysiology, but may also lead to the development of targeted treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Outcome measures included the Total Symptom Score (TSS) for neuropathic symptoms (pain, burning, paresthesias, and numbness) in the feet, and the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS). Data analysis was based on the intention to treat.\n\nRESULTS - No significant differences between the groups were noted for the demographic variables and the nerve function parameters at baseline. The TSS in the feet decreased from baseline to day 19 (median [range]) by -3.7 (-12.6 to 5.0) points in the group given alpha-lipoic acid intravenously and by -3.0 (-12.3 to 8.0) points in the placebo group (P = 0.447), but the area under curve on a daily basis was significantly smaller in the active as compared with the placebo group (85.6 [0-219] vs. 95.9 [5.5-220]); P = 0.033).

Messenger ribonucleic acids were extracted from 43 thyroid carcinomas (38 papillary and 5 follicular), 24 cold adenomas, 5 Graves' thyroid tissues, 8 toxic adenomas, and 5 hyperplastic thyroid tissues; 5 normal thyroid tissues were used as reference. A kinetic quantitative PCR method, based on the fluorescent TaqMan methodology and real-time measurement of fluorescence, was used.\n\n\nNIS expression was decreased in 40 of 43 thyroid carcinomas (10- to 1200-fold) and in 20 of 24 cold adenomas (2- to 700-fold); it was increased in toxic adenomas and Graves' thyroid tissues (up to 140-fold). TPO expression was decreased in thyroid carcinomas, but was normal in cold adenomas; it was increased in toxic adenomas and Graves' thyroid tissues.

Iodide uptake has been demonstrated in various extrathyroidal tissues, including salivary gland, gastric mucosa, and lactating mammary gland. Recently, cloning and molecular characterization of the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) have been reported; however, the patterns of hNIS gene expression in human tissues have remained unidentified. To examine the profiles of human hNIS gene expression in various normal human tissues, we performed high-stringency Northern blot analysis using a P-32-labeled hNIS-specific complementary DNA (cDNA) probe (nucleotides 1184-1667). To detect rare hNIS transcripts in small tissue samples, RT-PCR was performed with a pair of hNIS-specific oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify a portion (nucleotides 1184-1667) of the hNIS gene. hNIS-specific transcripts were confirmed by Southern hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled internal hNIS-specific oligonucleotide probe (nucleotides 1460-1477). To monitor cDNA integrity and quantity, and to rule out DNA contamination and illegitimate transcription, all samples were coamplified with two pairs of intron-spanning primers designed to amplify fragments of the human beta-actin and thyroglobulin genes, respectively. Using Northern blot analysis, hNIS transcripts of approximately 4 kb were detected in thyroid gland and parotid gland but not in a broad range of endocrine and nonendocrine tissues. RT-PCR and Southern hybridization revealed hNIS gene expression in thyroid gland, salivary gland, parotid gland, submandibular gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, testis, mammary gland, gastric mucosa, prostate and ovary, adrenal gland, heart, thymus, and lung. By contrast, hNIS transcripts were not detected in normal orbital fibroblasts, colon, and nasopharyngeal mucosa. To further analyze hNIS gene sequences in parotid gland, mammary gland, and gastric mucosa, the EXPAND High Fidelity PCR System and three sets of overlapping NIS oligonucleotide primers were used for amplification and cloning. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript-SK II(-)vector, and at least two independent cDNA clones derived from each tissue were subjected to automated sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of hNIS cDNA derived from parotid gland, mammary gland, and gastric mucosa revealed full identity with the recently published human thyroid-derived NIS cDNA sequence. In conclusion, our results demonstrate markedly variable levels of hNIS gene expression in several extrathyroidal tissues. Although the physiological role of hNIS in these tissues awaits further study, our results suggest that the capacity to actively transport iodine may be a feature common to several secretory and endocrine tissues. The diminished capacity to transport and concentrate iodide in extrathyroidal tissues (such as parotid gland, mammary gland, and gastric mucosa), compared with thyroid gland, does not seem to be caused by an altered primary structure of the hNIS cDNA. Variability of NIS gene expression levels in normal extrathyroidal tissues may rather be caused by differences in NIS gene transcriptional activity. Further studies will address this hypothesis and examine the mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of NIS gene expression.", "ISSN": "0021-972X", "pub": "JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM", "volume": "83", "authors": ["Spitzweg, C", "Joba, W", "Eisenmenger, W", "Heufelder, AE"], "issue": "5", "pages": "1746-1751"}, {"DOI": "10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01109.x", "pdflink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1464-5491/homepage/DME_poster.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2004", "title": "Treatment of symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy with the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid: a meta-analysis", "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01109.x/abstract;jsessionid=11FD76BBEE0356445866A57A96ED4ED5.f02t02", "abstract": "Aims To determine the efficacy and safety of 600 mg of a-lipoic acid given intravenously over 3 weeks in diabetic patients with symptomatic polyneuropathy.\n\nMethods We searched the database of VIATRIS GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany, for clinical trials of alpha-lipoic acid according to the following prerequisites: randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial using (x-lipoic acid infusions of 600 m i.v. per day for 3 weeks, except for weekends, in diabetic patients with positive sensory symptoms of polyneuropathy which were scored by the Total Symptom Score (TSS) in the feet on a daily basis.

Emphatically, no nauseous scent (H2S) appeared in our experiments, which could not be avoided in other previous reports. The morphology, structure, and phase composition of the as-prepared Bi2S3 products were characterized using various techniques (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy). The formation mechanism for the bismuth sulfide flowerlike assemblies with well-arranged nanorods was also discussed. In addition, other Bi2S3 homogeneous nanostructures (e.g., networklike nanoflakes, nanorod-based bundles, and nanoflakes) were obtained through varying the experimental parameters. Interestingly, we have found that these synthesized bismuth sulfide nanostructures using the biomoleucle-assisted approach could electrochemically charge and discharge with the capacity of 142 (mA h)/g (corresponding to 0.51 wt% hydrogen in single-walled carbon nanotubes) under normal atmosphere at room temperature. A novel two-plateau phenomenon was observed in the synthesized Bi2S3 nanostructures, suggesting that there were two independent steps in the charging process. It has been demonstrated that the bismuth sulfide's morphology and the constant charge-discharge current density had a noticeable influence on their capacity of electrochemical hydrogen storage. These differences in hydrogen storage capacity are likely due to the size and density of space/pores as well as the morphology of different Bi2S3 nanostructures. The novel Bi2S3 nanomaterials may find potential applications in hydrogen storage, high-energy batteries, luminescence, optoelectronic and catalytic fields, as well as in the studies of structure-property relationships.

Here, we evaluated available data on the role of MS in marine and estuarine communities and their interactions with other anthropogenic stressors, using an intensive analysis of the Chesapeake Bay region as a case study. First, we reviewed the reported ecological impacts of 196 species that occur in tidal waters of the bay, including species that are known invaders as well as some that are cryptogenic (i.e., of uncertain origin). Second, we compared the impacts reported in and out of the bay region for the same 54 species of plants and fish from this group that regularly occur in the region's tidal waters. Third, we assessed the evidence for interaction in the distribution or performance of these 54 plant and fish species within the bay and other stressors. Of the 196 known and possible NIS, 39 (20%) were thought to have some significant impact on a resident population, community, habitat, or process within the bay region. However, quantitative data on impacts were found for only 12 of the 39, representing 31% of this group and 6% of all 196 species surveyed. The patterns of reported impacts in the bay for plants and fish were nearly identical: 29% were reported to have significant impacts, but quantitative impact data existed for only 7% (4/54) of these species. In contrast, 74% of the same species were reported to have significant impacts outside of the bay, and some quantitative impact data were found for 44% (24/54) of them. Although it appears that 20% of the plant and fish species in our analysis may have significant impacts in the bay region based upon impacts measured elsewhere, we suggest that studies outside the region cannot reliably predict such impacts. We surmise that quantitative impact measures for individual bays or estuaries generally exist for <5% of the NIS present, and many of these measures are not particularly informative. Despite the increasing knowledge of marine invasions at many sites, it is evident that we understand little about the full extent and variety of the impacts they create-singly and cumulatively.

When 1 mU/ml TSH was added to quiescent FRTL-5 cells, a 12-h latency was observed before the onset of increased I- transport activity, which reached a maximum [similar to 27 times basal (5H medium) levels] at 72 h. In contrast, Northern blot analysis, using rat NIS complementary DNA as a probe, revealed that addition of TSH to these cells significantly increased NIS mRNA at 3-6 h, reaching a maximum after 24 h (similar to 5.9 times basal levels). Forskolin and (Bu)(2)cAMP mimicked this stimulatory effect on both the I- transport activity and mRNA levels. n-ribofranosylbenzimidazole, a transcription inhibitor, almost completely blocked TSH-induced stimulation of I- transport and NIS mRNA levels. Western blot analysis demonstrated that TSH increased NIS protein levels at 36 h, reaching a maximum at 72 h, in parallel with the kinetics of TSH-induced I- transport activity. However, it also showed that the amount of NIS protein already present in FRTL-5 cell membranes before the addition of TSH was about one third of the maximum level induced by TSH. These results indicate that stimulation of I- transport activity by TSH in thyrocytes is partly due to a rapid increase in NIS gene expression, followed by a relatively slow NIS protein synthesis.

L. lactis NZ9800, which does not produce nisin because of a deletion in the nisA gene, containing the nisF-gusA fusion plasmid, gave rise to beta-glucuronidase production only after induction by nisin, A similar regulation was found in L. lactis NZ3900, which contains a single copy of the nisR and nisK genes but no other genes of the nisin gene cluster, In contrast, when the nisK gene was disrupted, no beta-glucuronidase activity directed by the nisF promoter could he detected even after induction with nisin.

Gastrointestinal infections were most commonly viral and accounted for 76% of NIs in general pediatric units. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance depended on the type of unit. The highest rates were observed in PICUs: 26.3% of Staphylococcus aureus and 89% of CNS were methicillin-resistant, and 37.5% of Klebsiella pneumoniae had an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Mortality due to NI was 10% in PICUs and 17% in neonatal units.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We found large differences in NI frequency and microbial epidemiology in this European study Viruses were the main pathogens in general pediatrics units. Catheter-related sepsis and CNS were frequent in newborns. A high frequency of multiresistant bacteria was observed in some units. Clinical monitoring of NIs and bacterial resistance profiles are required in all pediatric units.", "ISSN": "0899-823X", "pub": "INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY", "volume": "21", "authors": ["Raymond, J", "Aujard, Y"], "issue": "4", "pages": "260-263"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/s11999-009-0945-0", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11999-009-0945-0.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 2010", "title": "The Epidemiology of Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty in the United States", "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11999-009-0945-0", "abstract": "Understanding the cause of failure and type of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures performed in the United States is essential in guiding research, implant design, and clinical decision making in TKA.

The human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP was stably transfected with NIS cDNA under the control of the prostate-specific antigen promoter. The stably transfected LNCaP cell line NP-1 showed perchlorate-sensitive, androgen-dependent iodide uptake in vitro that resulted in selective killing of these cells by I-131 in an in vitro clonogenic assay.

However, the oncolytic potency of MV-Edm in different human tumor xenograft therapy models is highly variable and there is no convenient way to map the distribution of virus-infected tissues in vivo. To enhance the oncolytic potency of MV-Edm against radiosensitive malignancies and to facilitate noninvasive imaging of infected tissues, we generated a recombinant MV-Edm encoding the human thyroidal iodide symporter (NIS). MV-NIS replicated almost as efficiently as unmodified MV-Edm, and human tumor cells efficiently concentrated radioiodine when infected with MV-NIS. Intratumoral spread of MV-NIS was noninvasively demonstrated by serial gamma-camera imaging of iodine-123 (I-123) Uptake both in MV-sensitive KAS-6/1 myeloma xenografts, which regressed completely after a single intravenous dose of MV-NIS, and in MM1 myeloma xenografts, which were unresponsive to MV-NIS therapy.

We later demonstrated that the escape is attributable to a decrease in iodide transport into the thyroid, lowering the intrathyroidal iodine content below a critical inhibitory threshold and allowing organification of iodide to resume. We have now measured the rat thyroid sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, in response to both chronic and acute iodide excess, in an attempt to determine the mechanism responsible for the decreased iodide transport. Rats were given 0.05% NaI in their drinking water for 1 and 6 days in the chronic experiments, and a single 2000-mu g dose of NaI ip in the acute experiments. Serum was collected for iodine and hormone measurements, and thyroids were frozen for subsequent measurement of NIS, TSH receptor, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin, and cyclophilin mRNAs (by Northern blotting) as well as NIS protein (by Western blotting). Serum T-4 and T-3 concentrations were significantly decreased at 1 day in the chronic experiments and returned to normal at 6 days, and were unchanged in the acute experiments. Serum TSH levels were unchanged in both paradigms. Both NIS mRNA and protein were decreased at 1 and 6 days after chronic iodide ingestion. MS mRNA was decreased at 6 and 24 h after acute iodide administration, whereas NIS protein was decreased only at 24 h. TPO mRNA was decreased at 6 days of chronic iodide ingestion and 24 h after acute iodide administration. There were no iodide-induced changes in TSH receptor and thyroglobulin mRNAs. These data suggest that iodide administration decreases both NIS mRNA and protein expression, by a mechanism that is likely to be, at least in part, transcriptional. Our findings support the hypothesis that the escape from the acute Wolff-Chaikoff effect is caused by a decrease in NIS, with a resultant decreased iodide transport into the thyroid.

We tested the hypothesis that provider volume of surgical treatment of TAAA is an important determinant of operative outcome.\n\nPatients and methods. Clinical information regarding repair of intact TAAA in 1542 patients from 1988 to 1998 was obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a stratified discharge database of a representative 20% of US hospitals. Demographic data included age, sex, race, nature of admission, and comorbid conditions. Annual hospital volume of TAAA treated was grouped into terciles and defined as low (LVH; 1-3 cases [median, 1]), medium (MVH; 2-9 cases [median, 4]), or high (HVH; 5-31 cases [median, 12]). Annual surgeon volume was defined as low (LVS; 1-2 cases [median, 1]) or high (HVS; 3-18 cases [median, 7]). The primary outcome measure was in-hospital postoperative mortality. Secondary outcome measures included length of stay, and cardiac, pulmonary, and renal complications. Adjusted and unadjusted analyses were conducted.\n\nResults. Overall mortality was 22.3%. Mortality improved over time. LVH and HVH differed in mortality rates (27.4% vs 15.0%; P <.001). Mortality between LVS and HVS also differed significantly (25.6% vs 11.0%; P <.001). When controlling for patient demographic data, comorbid conditions, and postoperative complications, both hospital and surgeon volume were significant predictors of mortality for intact TAAA repair (LVS: odds ratio [OR] 2.6, P <.001; LVH: OR 2.2, P <.001; and MVH: OR 1.7, P =.004).\n\nConclusions. Greater hospital and surgeon TAAA treatment volumes contribute to better outcome. Given the relative high perioperative mortality associated with TAAA repair, regionalization of care to high-volume providers with consistently lower postoperative mortality deserves consideration by patients, physicians, and health care planners.

Iodide uptake occurs across the membrane of the thyroid follicular cells through an active transporter process mediated by the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). The recent cloning of the NIS gene enabled the better characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying iodide transport, thus opening the way to the clarification and expansion of its role in nuclear medicine. In papillary and follicular carcinoma, NIS immunostaining was positive in only a few tumor cells, and no NIS protein expression was detected in anaplastic carcinomas. Decreased NIS expression levels account for the reduced iodide uptake in thyroid carcinomas. Thus, by targeting NIS expression in cancer cells, we could enable these cells to concentrate iodide from plasma and in so doing offer the possibility of radioiodine therapy. Several investigators have shown that gene transfer of NIS into a variety of cell types confers increased radioiodine uptake by up to several hundredfold that of controls in nonthyroid cancers as well as in thyroid cancer. In addition, my group proposes that NIS may serve as an alternative imaging reporter gene in addition to the HSVtk and dopaminergic receptor genes. The NIS has the potential to expand the role of nuclear medicine in the future, just as it has served as the base for the development of nuclear medicine in the past.", "ISSN": "0161-5505", "pub": "JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE", "volume": "43", "authors": ["Chung, JK"], "issue": "9", "pages": "1188-1200"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1991", "title": "MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF NICKEL CARCINOGENESIS", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0362-1642", "pub": "ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY", "volume": "31", "authors": ["COSTA, M"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "321-337"}]], [{"volume": 67.66961617661717, "formation_energy_per_atom": -0.16051976999999962, "band_gap": 0.0, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

In-situ immunolocalization experiments have demonstrated that geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase is located exclusively in the plastids.

Similar to other biosynthetic pathways, the production of isoprenoids in microorganisms is controlled by the supply of precursors, among other factors. To engineer a host that has the capability to supply geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a common precursor of isoprenoids, we cloned and overexpressed isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) isomerase (encoded by idi) from Escherichia coli and GGPP synthase (encoded by gps) from the archaebacterium Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The latter was shown to be a multifunctional enzyme converting dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to GGPP. These two genes and the gene cluster (crtBIYZW) of the marine bacterium Agrobacterium aurantiacum were introduced into E. coli to produce astaxanthin, an orange pigment and antioxidant. This metabolically engineered strain produces astaxanthin 50 times higher than values reported before. To determine the rate-controlling steps in GGPP production, the IDI-GPS pathway was compared with another construct containing idi, ispA (encoding farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase in E. coli), and crtE (encoding GGPP synthase from Erwinia uredovora). Results show that the conversion from FPP to GGPP is the first bottleneck, followed sequentially by IPP isomerization and FPP synthesis. Removal of these bottlenecks results in an E. coli strain providing sufficient precursors for in vivo synthesis of isoprenoids. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Furthermore, carotenoid production levels were higher in strains containing integrated carotenogenic genes. Overexpression of crtYB (which encodes a bifunctional phytoene synthase and lycopene cyclase) and crtI (phytoene desaturase) from X. dendrorhous was sufficient to enable carotenoid production. Carotenoid production levels were increased by additional overexpression of a homologous geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase from S. cerevisiae that is encoded by BTS1 Combined overexpression of crtE (heterologous GGPP synthase) from X. dendrorhous with crtYB and crtI and introduction of an additional copy of a truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase gene (tHMG1) into carotenoid-producing cells resulted in a successive increase in carotenoid production levels. The strains mentioned produced high levels of intermediates of the carotenogenic pathway and comparable low levels of the preferred end product beta-carotene, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography.

In this study we characterize a strain of Rhodobacter capsulatus, DB469, which contains a genomic disruption of an open reading frame in the photosynthesis gene cluster termed ORF469. Characterization of the steady-state level of bacteriochlorophyll synthesis demonstrates that disruption of ORF469 results in a 2.5-fold increase in aerobic synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll over that observed with the parent strain. Utilizing reporter plasmids that contain transcriptional fusions of lacZ to various carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis genes, we also demonstrate that disruption of ORF469 leads to an approximate twofold increase in bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid gene expression under anaerobic growth conditions. Similar analysis with reporter plasmids that contain translational fusions of lacZ to the puf, puh, and puc operons demonstrates that disruption of ORF469 leads to elevated levels of aerobic transcription of light harvesting-II genes (puc), without affecting light harvesting-I or reaction center gene expression (puf and puh, respectively).

Previous work in canola (Brassica napus) seed over-expressing the bacterial phytoene synthase gene (crtB) demonstrated a change in carotenoid content, such that the total levels of carotenoids, including phytoene and downstream metabolites like beta-carotene, were elevated 50-fold, with the ratio of beta- to alpha-carotene being 2 : 1. This result raised the possibility that the composition of metabolites in this pathway could be modified further in conjunction with the increased flux obtained with crtB. Here we report on the expression of additional bacterial genes for the enzymes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (crtE), phytoene desaturase (crtI) and lycopene cyclase (crtY and the plant B. napus lycopene beta-cyclase) engineered in conjunction with phytoene synthase (crtB) in transgenic canola seed. Analysis of the carotenoid levels by HPLC revealed a 90% decrease in phytoene levels for the double construct expressing crtB in conjunction with crtI. The transgenic seed from all the double constructs, including the one expressing the bacterial crtB and the plant lycopene beta-cyclase showed an increase in the levels of total carotenoid similar to that previously observed by expressing crtB alone but minimal effects were observed with respect to the ratio of beta- to alpha-carotene compared to the original construct. However, the beta- to alpha-carotene ratio was increased from 2 : 1 to 3 : 1 when a triple construct consisting of the bacterial phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase and lycopene cyclase genes were expressed together. This result suggests that the bacterial genes may form an aggregate complex that allows in vivo activity of all three proteins through substrate channeling. This finding should allow further manipulation of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway for downstream products with enhanced agronomic, animal feed and human nutritional values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, mBJLDA, having no atom-dependent parameters, makes zincblende MnAs become a truly half-metallic (HM) ferromagnet with a HM gap (the key parameter) 0.318 eV, being consistent with experiment. For zincblende MnSb, CrAs, CrSb, CrSe, or CrTe, the HM gap is enhanced by 19-56% compared to LDA and generalized gradient approximation results. The improved HM ferromagnetism can be understood in terms of the mBJLDA-enhanced spin exchange splitting.

The genes encoding many carotenoid biosynthetic pathways have now been mapped and cloned in several different species, and the availability of cloned genes which encode the biosynthesis of carotenoids not found in the photosynthetic genus Rhodobacter opens up the possibility of introducing a wider range of foreign carotenoids into the bacterial photosynthetic apparatus than would normally be available by producing mutants of the native biosynthetic pathway. For example, the crt genes from Erwinia herbicola, a gram-negative nonphotosynthetic bacterium which produces carotenoids in the sequence of phytoene, lycopene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and zeaxanthin glucosides, are clustered within a 12.8-kb region and have been mapped and partially sequenced. In this paper, part of the E. herbicola crt cluster has been excised and expressed in various crt strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. This has produced light-harvesting complexes with a novel carotenoid composition, in which the foreign carotenoids such as p-carotene function successfully in light harvesting. The outcome of the combination of the crt genes in R. sphaeroides with those from E. herbicola has, in some cases, resulted in an interesting rerouting of the expected biosynthetic sequence, which has also provided insights into how the various enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway might interact. Clearly this approach has considerable potential for studies on the control and organization of carotenoid biosynthesis, as well as providing novel pigment-protein complexes for functional studies.", "ISSN": "0021-9193", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY", "volume": "176", "authors": ["HUNTER, CN", "HUNDLE, BS", "HEARST, JE", "LANG, HP", "GARDINER, AT", "TAKAICHI, S", "COGDELL, RJ"], "issue": "12", "pages": "3692-3697"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0168-9525(93)90188-N", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016895259390188N/pdf?md5=af1dda0e0b094f250581cb2eeb80f153&pid=1-s2.0-016895259390188N-main.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 1993", "title": "CONTROL OF PHOTOSYSTEM GENES IN RHODOBACTER-CAPSULATUS", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016895259390188N", "abstract": "Two environmental factors, oxygen and high light intensity, are known to repress synthesis of the Rhodobacter capsulatus photosystem.

In this study, we found that Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a gram-positive filamentous bacterium, produces carotenoids under blue light induction. The carotenoid fraction isolated from the cell extract contained multiple compounds, including isorenieratene and beta-carotene. The carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster of S. coelicolor consists of two convergent operons, crtEIBV and ertYTU, as previously shown for Streptomyces griseus. The crtEIBV null mutant completely lost its ability to produce carotenoids. The crt gene cluster is flanked by a regulatory region that consists of two divergent operons, litRQ and litSAB. The lit (light-induced transcription) genes encode a MerR-type transcriptional regulator (LitR), a possible oxidoreductase (LitQ), an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor (sigma(LitS)), a putative lipoprotein (LitA), and a putative anti-sigma factor (LitB). S1 protection assay revealed that the promoters preceding crtE (PcrtE), crtY (PcrtY), litR (PlitR), and litS (PlitS) are activated upon illumination. A IUS mutant lost both the ability to produce carotenoids and the activities of PcrtE, PcrtY, and PlitS, which suggested that sigma(LitS) directs light-induced transcription from these promoters. An RNA polymerase holocomplex containing purified sigma(LitS) recombinant protein generated specific PcrtE and PcrtY transcripts in an in vitro runoff transcriptional assay. A litR mutant that had an insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene was defective both in the ability to produce carotenoids and in all of the light-dependent promoter activities. Overexpression of litS resulted in constitutive carotenoid production in both the wild type and the litR mutant. These results indicate that sigma(LitS) acts as a light-induced sigma factor that directs transcription of the crt biosynthesis gene cluster, whose activity is controlled by an unknown LitR function.

The highest level of production of zeaxanthin in E. coli (820 mu g/g [dry weight]) was observed in the transformant with a plasmid in which the gene order corresponds to the order of the zeaxanthin metabolic pathway (crtE-crtB-crtI-crtY-crtZ), among a series of plasmids with circularly permuted gene orders.

We find that band-structure theory, based on density-functional theory in the local spin-density approximation, explains the measured Kerr effect of MnBi very well. A giant Kerr rotation of about - 1.75 degrees at 1.8 eV photon energy is given by our ab initio calculations, in accordance with recent experiments. A second peak at 3.4 eV in the Kerr rotation spectrum, however, comes out smaller in our calculations than what was recently measured. It is discussed that this can be due to the Mn-Bi stoichiometry. The microscopic origin of the giant Kerr effect in MnBi is analyzed in detail. We find that the huge Kerr effect in MnBi is caused by the combination of a sizeable magnetic moment of 3.7 mu(B) on manganese, the large spin-orbit coupling of bismuth, and a strong hybridization between the manganese d bands and the bismuth p states. The magneto-optically active states are mainly the p states of Bi. We pay further attention to the experimentally observed unusual temperature dependence of the MnBi Kerr spectra. We show that the observed temperature dependence can be explained by the reduction of the magnetic moment and the average lifetime with increasing temperature.

Rescued DNA from transposon color mutants of this Gram-positive bacterium was used to clone the carotenoid biosynthetic gene cluster By sequence comparison and functional, complementation, the genes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids with 50 carbon atoms were identified. The genes crtE, encoding a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, crtB, encoding a phytoene synthase, and crtI, encoding a phytoene desaturase, are responsible for the formation of lycopene. The products of three novel genes, crtYe and crtYf, with sequence similarities to heterodimeric lycopene cyclase crtYe and crtYd, together with crtEb which exhibits a prenyl transferase motif, were involved in the conversion of C-40 acyclic lycopene to cyclic C-50 carotenoids. Using functional complementation in Escherichia coli, it could be shown that the elongation of lycopene to the acyclic C-50 carotenoid flavuxanthin by the addition of Cg isoprenoid units at positions C-2 and C-2' is catalyzed by the crtEb gene product. Subsequently, the gene products of crtYe and crtYf in a concerted action convert the acyclic flavuxanthin into the cyclic C-50 carotene, decaprenoxanthin, forming two epsilon -ionone groups. The mechanisms, involving two individual steps for the formation of cyclic C-50 carotenoids from lycopene, are proposed on the basis of these results.", "ISSN": "0014-2956", "pub": "EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY", "volume": "268", "authors": ["Krubasik, P", "Kobayashi, M", "Sandmann, G"], "issue": "13", "pages": "3702-3708"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/s00253-006-0623-z", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00253-006-0623-z.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 2007", "title": "Engineering the lycopene synthetic pathway in E-coli by comparison of the carotenoid genes of Pantoea agglomerans and Pantoea ananatis", "DOIlink": "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00253-006-0623-z", "abstract": "The lycopene synthetic pathway was engineered in Escherichia coli using the carotenoid genes (crtE, crtB, and crtI) of Pantoea agglomerans and Pantoea ananatis. E. coli harboring the P. agglomerans crt genes produced 27 mg/l of lycopene in 2YT medium without isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction, which was twofold higher than that produced by E. coli harboring the P. ananatis crt genes (12 mg/l lycopene) with 0.1 mM IPTG induction. The crt genes of P. agglomerans proved better for lycopene production in E. coli than those of P. ananatis. The crt genes of the two bacteria were also compared in E. coli harboring the mevalonate bottom pathway, which was capable of providing sufficient carotenoid building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), with exogenous mevalonate supplementation. Lycopene production significantly increased using the mevalonate bottom pathway and 60 mg/l of lycopene was obtained with the P. agglomerans crt genes, which was higher than that obtained with the P. ananatis crt genes (35 mg/l lycopene). When crtE among the P. ananatis crt genes was replaced with P. agglomerans crtE or Archaeoglobus fulgidus gps, both lycopene production and cell growth were similar to that obtained with P. agglomerans crt genes. The crtE gene was responsible for the observed difference in lycopene production and cell growth between E. coli harboring the crt genes of P. agglomerans and P. ananatis. As there was no significant difference in lycopene production between E. coli harboring P. agglomerans crtE and A. fulgidus gps, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthesis was not rate-limiting in E. coli.", "ISSN": "0175-7598", "pub": "APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY", "volume": "74", "authors": ["Yoon, SH", "Kim, JE", "Lee, SH", "Park, HM", "Choi, MS", "Kim, JY", "Lee, SH", "Shin, YC", "Keasling, JD", "Kim, SW"], "issue": "1", "pages": "131-139"}]], [{"volume": 71.20715591946036, "formation_energy_per_atom": -0.5034944067968743, "band_gap": 0.0, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.
