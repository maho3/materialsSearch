There was a BaCuO2 impurity phase detected with x less than or equal to 0.10. The structure of the main phase (\"123\") has the orthorhombic form with Pmmm symmetry in the whole doping range. With increasing content of lanthanum, x, the lattice constants increase for x < 0.04, and decrease for x <greater than or equal to> 0.04. Rietveld refinements for X-ray diffraction show that the dopant of lanthanum substitutes for copper in the lower doping level, and replaces for both barium and copper in the high doping level. The zero-resistance temperature T-c0 first increases with the increase of the content of lanthanum in YBCLO as x less than or equal to 0.04 and then decreases with x as x greater than or equal to 0.04. We compared the results with those of La-doped YBa2-zLazCu3Oy cuprates.

The films are switched between amorphous and crystalline states using the heat of a focussed laser beam. Large reflectivity differences between amorphous and crystalline states are then used to store and retrieve the information. An active chalcogenide layer for this purpose should have a high optical absorption coefficient(cc), and good structural and thermal stability. It should be possible to switch the chalcogenide layer between amorphous and crystalline states repeatedly within a short duration, the optical contrast should be high, and the material must have large cycling capability. Keeping the above requirements in mind, we have carried out systematic investigation of structural, optical and crystallization behaviour of thin films of various compositions of GaGeTe, Sb2Te3 and BiSe.

This paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of technical fields where TiO2 is of importance. The bulk structure and bulk defects (as far as relevant to the surface properties) are briefly reviewed. Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exemplified on rutile (110). The surface structure of rutile (110) is discussed in some detail. Theoretically predicted and experimentally determined relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations of crystallographic shear planes-CSPs) are discussed, as well as the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The controversy about the correct model for the (1 x 2) reconstruction appears to be settled. Different surface preparation methods, such as reoxidation of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries and morphology, and recommendations for preparing different TiO2(110) surfaces are given. The structure of the TiO2(100)-(1 x 1) surface is discussed and the proposed models for the (1 x 3) reconstruction are critically reviewed. Very recent results on anatase (100) and (101) surfaces are included.\n\nThe electronic structure of stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces is now well understood. Surface defects can be detected with a variety of surface spectroscopies. The vibrational structure is dominated by strong Fuchs-Kliewer phonons, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectra often need to be deconvoluted in order to render useful information about adsorbed molecules.\n\nThe growth of metals (Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Al, Ti, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) as well as some metal oxides on TiO2 is reviewed. The tendency to 'wet' the overlayer, the growth morphology, the epitaxial relationship, and the strength of the interfacial oxidation/reduction reaction all follow clear trends across the periodic table, with the reactivity of the overlayer metal towards oxygen being the most decisive factor. Alkali atoms form ordered superstructures at low coverages. Recent progress in understanding the surface structure of metals in the 'strong-metal support interaction' (SMSI) state is summarized.\n\nLiterature is reviewed on the adsorption and reaction of a wide variety of inorganic molecules (H-2, O-2, H2O, CO, CO2, N-2, NH3, NOx, sulfur- and halogen-containing molecules, rare gases) as well as organic molecules (carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkynes, pyridine and its derivates, silanes, methyl halides). The application of TiO2-based systems in photo-active devices is discussed, and the results on UHV-based photocatalytic studies are summarized. The review ends with a brief conclusion and outlook of TiO2-based surface science for the future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The influence of the support on catalyst activity and carbon deposition resistivity was markedly different in each case. Although considerable formation of filamentous carbon was observed over Ni/SiO2 (confirmed by TEM and TPO), there was negligible initial loss of catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of Ni/C was very similar to that of Ni/SiO2, but no filamentous carbon appeared to be formed. In contrast to Ni/SiO2, substantially less coking was observed over either the Ni/TiO2 or the Ni/MgO catalysts. Evidence of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in the Ni/TiO2 catalyst indicated that large ensembles of nickel atoms, active for carbon deposition, are deactivated or removed by the presence of mobile TiOx species. The identification of two TiOx phases and a Ni5TiO7 phase was made possible by direct measurement of crystalline d spacings with TEM. The Ni/MgO catalyst was both active and very stable for up to 44 h time on stream.

One central issue of concern in engineering metal/oxide interfaces is to understand and control the interactions which consist of two fundamental aspects: (i) interfacial charge redistribution - electronic interaction, and (ii) interfacial atom transport - chemical interaction. The present paper focuses on recent advances in both electronic and atomic level understanding of the metal-oxide interactions at temperatures below 1000 degrees C, with special emphasis on model systems like ultrathin metal overlayers or metal nanoclusters supported on well-defined oxide surfaces. The important factors determining the metal-oxide interactions are provided. Guidelines are given in order to predict the interactions in such systems, and methods to desirably tune them are suggested.\n\nThe review starts with a brief summary of the physics and chemistry of heterophase interface contacts. Basic concepts for quantifying the electronic interaction at metal/oxide interfaces are compared to well-developed contact theories and calculation methods. The chemical interaction between metals and oxides, i.e., the interface chemical reaction, is described in terms of its thermodynamics and kinetics. We review the different chemical driving forces and the influence of kinetics on interface reactions, proposing a strong interplay between the chemical interaction and electronic interaction, which is decisive for the final interfacial reactivity. In addition, a brief review of solid-gas interface reactions (oxidation of metal surfaces and etching of semiconductor surfaces) is given, in addition to a comparison of a similar mechanism dominating in solid-solid and solid-gas interface reactions.\n\nThe main body of the paper reviews experimental and theoretical results from the literature concerning the interactions between metals and oxides (TiO2, SrTiO3, Al2O3, MgO, SiO2, etc.). Chemical reactions, e.g., redox reactions, encapsulation reactions, and alloy formation reactions, are highlighted for metals in contact with mixed conducting oxides of TiO2 and SrTiO3. The dependence of the chemical interactions on the electronic structure of the contacting metal and oxide phases is demonstrated. This dependence originates from the interplay between interfacial space charge transfer and diffusion of ionic defects across interfaces. Interactions between metals and insulating oxides, such as Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2, are strongly confined to the interfaces. Literature results are cited which discuss how the metal/oxide interactions vary with oxide surface properties (surface defects, surface termination, surface hydroxylation, etc.). However, on the surfaces of thin oxide films grown on conducting supports, the effect of the conducting substrates on metal-oxide interactions should be carefully considered.\n\nIn the summary, we conclude how variations in the electronic structure of the metal/oxide junctions enable one to tune the interfacial reactivity and, furthermore, control the macroscopic properties of the interfaces. This includes strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), catalytic performance, electrical, and mechanical properties. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Ni/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts showed much better catalytic performance than either CeO2- or gamma-Al2O3-supported Ni catalysts. CeO2 as a support for Ni catalysts produced a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which reduced the catalytic activity and carbon deposition. However, CeO2 had positive effect on catalytic activity, stability, and carbon suppression when used as a promoter in Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts for this reaction. A weight loading of 1-5 wt% CeO2 was found to be the optimum. Ni catalysts with CeO2 promoters reduced the chemical interaction between nickel and support, resulting in an increase in reducibility and stronger dispersion of nickel. The stability and less coking on CeO2-promoted catalysts are attributed to the oxidative properties of CeO2. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The catalytic activity is determined by the accessibility of Pt on the Pt-ZrO2 perimeter. This is explained in terms of the CO2 activation via carbonate species on the support which must be in the proximity of the Pt particles to react with the methane activated on the metal. The significance of the support is also emphasized by the low activity of Pt black and Pt/SiO2, which were incapable of forming carbonates on the support. The perimeter concentration of Pt/ZrO2 can be changed by changing the Pt concentration in the catalyst or by increasing the calcination temperature which causes sintering of the Pt particles. In contrast to the calcination temperature, the reduction temperature did not influence the activity although the hydrogen chemisorption capacity was markedly decreased by increasing the reduction temperature. As sintering was excluded on basis of particle size determination from EXAFS results a SMSI state on Pt/ZrO2 during high temperature reduction is concluded to exist. This state does not persist under reaction conditions due to the presence of adsorbed oxygen from CO2 dissociation.

The ceria-zirconia mixed oxide is itself an active catalyst for methane combustion, in the 673-1073 K temperature range. Deposition of platinum or palladium on this support results in a strong increase in activity, which now takes place at low temperature (473-773 K). The ceria-zirconia support is particularly beneficial for the activity of platinum, when compared to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Methane oxidation takes place at the active ceria-zirconia/metal interface, according to a redox mechanism involving the reaction of dissociated methane with lattice oxygen from the support. However, a time-on-stream deactivation is observed at moderate temperatures (573-623 K), which is associated with an oxidized state of the catalysts, whereas a reduction at 573 K strongly activates the solids. In situ electrical conductivity measurements show that the reduction at 573 K of the Pt/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 and Pd/Ce0.67Zr0.33O2 Catalysts creates a large amount of oxygen vacancies. Although the reduced ceria-zirconia support is largely reoxidized by oxygen at 573 K, some vacancies still remain and require a higher oxidation temperature (773 K) to be filled. The presence of vacancies, even in small amounts, seems to favor activity because of an electron transfer to the noble metals and an improvement of the lattice oxygen mobility. The slow filling of these vacancies is probably an important factor contributing to the observed time-on-stream deactivation.

The results show that the structure of the nickel active phase strongly depends on the interactions of the metal and the support, which are related to the support properties, the additives and the preparation conditions. \"Free\" Ni species can be formed when the interaction is weak and their mobility makes them easily deactivated by coking and sintering.

The formation of solid solution of Ni-Mg-O-2 and the blocking of TiOx by the partially reduced TiO2 can both decrease the availability of Ni active sites in Ni/MgO and Ni/TiO2. The spinel NiAl2O4 formed in Ni/gamma -Al2O3 might be responsible for its high activity and resistance to coking and sintering because it can produce a highly dispersed active phase and a large active surface area as bound-state Ni species when the catalyst is prepared at high calcined temperatures or with low nickel loading.

The volumetric adsorption and FTIR spectroscopic studies show the occurrence of considerable changes in the chemistry of the H-2-(Rh/CeO2) system upon increasing the reduction temperature from 623 to 773 K.  However, the H/Rh values determined from hydrogen isotherms at 191 K suggest that the rhodium microcrystals remain chemically active after reduction at 773 K. The major effect of the high-temperature reduction treatment would be the blocking of the spillover process, much slower on the catalysts reduced at 773 K. In agreement with this, no dramatic effect of the reduction temperature on the catalytic activity for benzene hydrogenation has been found. These observations contrast with some recent results in the literature, in accordance with which ceria-supported metal catalysts exhibit the so-called SMSI effect. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs reported here for Rh/CeO2 catalysts show clean, well-faceted rhodium particles. No evidences of metal decoration phenomena like those earlier reported for Rh/TiO2 could be obtained from them. However, HRTEM images of the metal/support interface reveal an epitaxial growth of the rhodium microcrystal on ceria. The structural nature of this epitaxial relationship is rather singular leading to the regular appearance of rhodium dislocations at the metal/support interface. In addition to several other observations also based on the HRTEM images, the occurrence of such an epitaxy might well be interpreted as being due to some kind of strong metal-support interaction.

Hence, the detection of soil moisture content (SMC) is very valuable in the social, economic, humanitarian (food security) and environmental segments of society. A method to estimate SMC from optical and thermal spectral information of METEOSAT imagery based on thermal inertia (TI) is presented. Minimum and maximum TI values from time series are combined in the Soil Moisture Saturation Index (SMSI). To convert surface to soil profile values, a Markov type filter is used, based on a simple two layer water balance equation (the surface layer and the reservoir below) and an autocorrelation function.

Moreover, the thermal inertia approach is compared for 1997, with ERS Scatterometer data for eight EUROFLUX sites. METEOSAT pixels are up-scaled to accommodate the ERS Scatterometer spatial resolution. The regression coefficients (slope, intercept and R(2)) of the thermal inertia approach versus the up-scaled soil moisture observations from EUROFLUX sites vary between 0.811-1.148, -0.0029-0.66 and 0.544-0.877, respectively, with a RRMSE range of 3.9% to 35.7%.

Significant enhancement in selectivity toward crotyl alcohol was observed with each catalyst after reduction at 773 K. DRIFT spectra under reaction conditions identified crotonaldehyde species strongly adsorbed through the C=C bond and weakly coordinated through both the C=C and the C=O bonds on these catalysts after reduction at 573 K, which gave a peak at 1693 cm(-1). After reduction at 773 K, an additional adsorbed species with a strong band at 1660 cm(-1), indicating a significant interaction between the carbonyl group and the surface, was observed, which is presumed to be stabilized at interfacial Pt-TiOx and Ni-TiOx sites. A decrease in the surface coverage of this species paralleled a drop in selectivity to crotyl alcohol with time on stream. After reduction at 573 K, decarbonylation occurred during the initial few minutes on stream to create adsorbed CO on Pt/TiO2 in addition to carbon deposition, but these reactions were significantly suppressed after reduction at 773 K, presumably due to a TiOx overlayer which covers part of the Pt surface and breaks up the ensembles of Pt atoms required for these reactions.

Carbon monoxide chemisorption measurements show that a loss of exposed metal area occurs during the activation procedure, even though the conditions do not favour platinum sintering. Following activation (and subsequent exposure to air at ambient temperature),the surface ceria is left in a highly reducible state, which is characterised by a subambient peak during temperature-programmed reduction. We envisage that the strong interaction arises according to a traditional SMSI model, by the migration of partially reduced ceria over the surface of the platinum particles (at greater than or equal to 600 degrees C). The resultant high degree of contact between the metal (with high work-function) and the metal oxide (with high band gap) promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies on the ceria surface. Although the presence of this highly reducible ceria-covering blocks conventional three-way sites on the platinum, it provides new sites that are active even at low temperatures. Therefore, unlike most previous explanations of promotion caused by a strong interaction, we propose that the 'support' becomes the active phase. Re-oxidation at elevated temperatures causes the ceria covering to coalesce, leading initially to its partial thinning, and subsequently to the re-exposure of the platinum particles.", "ISSN": "0926-3373", "pub": "APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL", "volume": "5", "authors": ["GOLUNSKI, SE", "HATCHER, HA", "RAJARAM, RR", "TRUEX, TJ"], "issue": "4", "pages": "367-376"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.12.011", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566736707005390/pdfft?md5=54e349ea5ad901ef21ae7f5cab1a9a08&pid=1-s2.0-S1566736707005390-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 31 2008", "title": "Hydrogenolysis of glycerol to glycols over ruthenium catalysts: Effect of support and catalyst reduction temperature", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566736707005390", "abstract": "The effect of support and catalyst reduction temperature on the catalytic performance of ruthenium catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol was studied.

The catalyst surface was characterized by H-2 and CO chemisorption, infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ethylene. The TiO2-added I'd catalyst reduced at 500degreesC, denoted in this study Pd-Ti/SiO2/500degreesC, showed a higher selectivity for ethylene production than either the Pd/TiO2 or Pd/SiO2 catalyst. The amounts of chemisorbed H-2 and CO were significantly reduced and, in particular, the adsorption of multiply coordinated CO species was suppressed on Pd-Ti/SiO2/500degreesC, which is characteristic of the well-known strong-metal-support-interaction (SMSI) phenomenon that has been observed with the TiO2-supported Pd catalyst reduced at 500degreesC, Pd/TiO2/500degreesC. XPS analyses of Pd-Ti/SiO2/500degreesC suggested an electronic modification of Pd by TiO2, and the TPD of ethylene from the catalyst showed the weakening in ethylene adsorption on the Pd surface. 1,3-Butadiene was produced in smaller amounts when using Pd-Ti/SiO2/500degreesC than when using Pd/SiO2/500degreesC, indicating that the polymerization of C-2 species leading to catalyst deactivation proceeds at slower rates on the former catalyst than on the latter. The enhanced ethylene selectivity on Pd-Ti/SiO2/500degreesC may be explained by correlating the catalyst surface properties with the mechanism of acetylene hydrogenation.

TEM shows a preferential nucleation of the oxidized Cu phase on the ceria-rich regions, leading to a particle size in the Cu-containing phase smaller than that found in the Al2O3-supported system and decreasing the formation of the CuAl2O4 spinel. The Cu-Ce interaction developed in the calcination treatment also gives significant stability against sintering of the metallic copper phase formed during H-2 reduction. After reduction, the Ce-containing sample shows higher resistance to reoxidation of the surface copper phase by NO to the Cu2+ State (in comparison to Cu/Al2O3), On the basis of XPS-Ar+ sputtering data, this may be related to partial coverage of the metallic Cu by reduced ceria in a way similar to that currently accepted for the SMSI effect; a capability of the Ce-containing support to stabilize the Cu+ state may also contribute to this behaviour. This stable copper state appears in subsurface regions and is likely related to a new phase detected by TEM-ED and tentatively identified as a (Ce,Cu)-Al perovskite, The copper-cerium interaction affects also the reactivity of the catalyst towards NO, increasing (partly through a dissociative mechanism) the amount of adsorbed species which leads to low temperature NO and N-2/N2O desorption, as well as shifting the decomposition temperatures of surface species containing N-N bonds (N-2/N2O) formed upon NO adsorption. It is proposed that the addition of ceria may help to enhance the reductive elimination of NO by copper in automobile exhaust gases.

TiO2 (B) and H2Ti3O7 nanofibers are 10-20 nm in diameter and several micrometers long, but FE-SEM reveals that several of these nanofibers tend to bind tightly to each other, forming a fiber bundle.

Calcination at a temperature higher than 773 K (in ambient air) resulted in ail SMSI effect similar to that observed over TiO2 in the reductive atmosphere.

The heat of adsorption of the weakly held state on the support is about 38 kJ mol(-1). For a catalyst with 12% coverage of Pd, the whole of the support provides CO by diffusion to the metal particles up to a temperature of 330 K, at which point the diffusion range of the precursor on the support becomes shorter than the interparticle separation. Further, the CO appears to be significantly more weakly held on the nanoparticles than on a Pd single crystal surface (initial heat of adsorption of 110 U mol(-1) versus 135 kJ mol(-1)), showing zero net sticking above 400 K. Annealing of the model catalyst above 573 K leads to a significant loss of CO uptake and sticking probability, probably due to a combination of sintering and an SMSI-like effect. The reduced reactivity of the nanoparticles is due to alloying of the Pd with Ti, the latter originating from Ti3+ interstitials in the bulk of the TiO2. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The catalyst was prepared by a combustion method and, after calcination, very small (about 10 nm) and homogeneous cubic particles of NiO are formed. Once reduced in hydrogen at high temperature (750 degrees C), the catalyst is active in both steam and dry reforming reactions of methane, but much more stable for the dry reforming reaction. In situ XAS analysis reveals that under reaction conditions at high temperature, the nickel remains completely reduced to Ni(0). However, under strongly reducing conditions (hydrogen or dry reforming at 750 degrees C), the Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum undergoes unexpected modifications that, according to the parameters obtained by fitting analysis, come from changes in the size and morphology of nickel particles, which are now flattened and strongly stabilized on the partially reduced ceria surface. These morphology changes reflect a kind of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), and could account for the higher stability observed for the dry reforming reaction. The flattened particles are not stable after cooling down to room temperature in hydrogen, while the coke deposited during the dry reforming reaction seems to block the particles, which partially remain even after cooling down to room temperature.

Here, we present a new approach by exploring robust noncarbon Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2) used as a novel functionalized cocatalytic support for Pt. This approach is based on the novel nanostructure Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2) support with \"electronic transfer mechanism\" from Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2) to Pt that can modify the surface electronic structure of Pt, owing to a shift in the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms. Furthermore, another benefit of Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2) is the extremely high stability of Pt/Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2) during potential cycling, which is attributable to the strong metal/support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2). This also enhances the inherent structural and chemical stability and the corrosion resistance of the TiO(2)-based oxide in acidic and oxidative environments. We also demonstrate that the ORR current densities generated using cocatalytic Pt/Ti(0.7)Mo(0.3)O(2) are respectively ~7- and 2.6-fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C and PtCo/C catalysts with the same Pt loading.

We focused on 4 EOHs of particular toxicological interest: acetylcholinesterase (AChE: acute neurotoxicity; cognition enhancement), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE: inhibition of drug metabolism and/or stoichiometric scavenging of EOH inhibitors; cognition enhancement), carboxylesterase (CaE: inhibition of drug metabolism and/or stoichiometric scavenging of EOH inhibitors), and neuropathy target esterase (NTE: delayed neurotoxicity, OPIDN). The relative degree of inhibition of these EOHs constitutes the \"esterase profile\" of an OPC and serves as a major determinant of its net physiological effects. Thus, understanding and controlling the esterase profile of OPC activity and selectivity toward these 4 target enzymes is a significant undertaking. In the present study, we analyzed the inhibitor properties of 52 OPCs against the 4 EOHs, along with pairwise and multitarget selectivities between them, using 2 QSAR approaches: Hansch modeling and Molecular Field Topology Analysis (MFTA). The general formula of the OPCs was (RO)(2)P(O)X, where R = alkyl, X = - SCH(Hal)COOEt (Hal = Cl, Br), -SCHCl2, -SCH2Br, -OCH(CF3)R-1 (R-1 = C6H5, CF3, COOEt, COOMe). The Hansch model showed that increasing neuropathic potential correlated with rising R hydrophobicity; moreover, OPC binding to scavenger EOHs (BChE and CaE) had different effects on potential acute and delayed neurotoxicity. Predicted protective roles of BChE and CaE against acute toxicity were enhanced with increasing hydrophobicity, but projected protection against OPIDN was decreased. Next, Molecular Field Topology Analysis (MFTA) models were built, considering atomic descriptors, e.g., effective charge, van der Waals radius of environment, and group lipophilicity. Activity/selectivity maps confirmed predictions from Hansch models and revealed other structural factors affecting activity and selectivity. Virtual screening based on multitarget selectivity MFTA models was used to design libraries of OPCs with favorable esterase profiles for potential application as selective inhibitors of CaE without untoward side effects.

Various possible reaction pathways are considered. On the doublet potential energy surface, five dissociation products are both thermodynamically and kinetically possible. Among these products, P-7 (SCHCl- + CS) may be the most favorable product with predominant abundances, whereas P-1 (Cl- + SCHCS) and P-2 (Cl- + HCCSS) may be the second and third Feasible products followed by the almost negligible P-3 (Cl- + HSCCS), P-4 (CClS- + HCS), and P-6 (S-cCCS(-) + HCl). Because the isomers and transition states involved in the most feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be fast, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant in recent experiment.

Regioselective formylation (para to the -OH group) was achieved. The conversion rates were 96, 81, and 88% for 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and protocatechualdehyde, respectively, and the yields of the recovered products after work-up amounted to 88, 75, and 83%, respectively. In the case of guaiacol, 17% of isovanillin was obtained as by-product. It was found that the presence of water or ethyl acetate in the reaction mixture, at a molar ratio of 60:1 (water: guaiacol) or 120:1 (ethyl acetate: guaiacol), had little influence on the yields under the reaction conditions. Factors influencing the yields are discussed in the study.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the most favorable association between CHCl- and CSO is found to be middle-C attack forming CHClC(O)S- 1 with no barrier. Starting from 1, the most feasible pathway is the concerted S-shift along with Cl-extrusion of 1 to form product P-2(Cl- + SCHCO). The minor product channel is the concerted O-shift along with Cl-extrusion of 1 to generate product P-1(Cl- + OCHCS). Further conversions of P-1 may form P-6(SCHCl- + CO). Because the isomers and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to proceed very fast which is consistent with the measured large rate constant in experiment. Our calculated results may be helpful for understanding the mechanism of the title reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Such studies have been performed extensively on graphite, transition-metal dichalcogenides and oxide bronzes(1). Interest in redox intercalation reactions(2) has increased recently because the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors based on copper oxide also have layered structures, the superconductivity occurring within two-dimensional CuO2 planes separated by charge-reservoir oxide layers(3). Similarly, in metal-doped fullerenes, which show relatively high transition temperatures, the electron donor atoms sit in the interstitial sites between adjacent fullerene balls(4). In a previous study(5), we described a layered nitride, beta-ZrNCl, consisting of Zr-N double layers sandwiched between two close-packed chlorine layers. On lithium intercalation, the crystal changed from a semiconductor to a metal, and became a superconductor at 13 K. Here we report the properties of the isostructural compound beta-HfNCl. After electron-doping the crystal by lithium intercalation, we observe superconductivity with a T-c of up to 25.5 K.

Broadening EDLTs to induce superconductivity within other materials is highly demanded for enriching the materials science of superconductors. However, it is severely hampered by inadequate choice of materials and processing techniques(13).

Polar solvent molecules such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, and propylene;carbonate were co-intercalated with the alkali metals, expanding the interlayer spacing.

Here we present key features of high level ab initio band structure calculations on the insulating ZrNCl and HfNCl parent compounds. Electron doping through intercalation has been modeled within a rigid-band framework. Features in the energy isosurfaces of the 'doped' compounds are examined for nesting instabilities of the kind that have been implicated in the superconducting properties of high-T-c compounds with square nets.

The structural and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a combination of resonant valence bond and excitonic insulator physics, and incorporating boson-fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different fashion, the latter leads to some similarities with the high temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The excitonic insulator behaviour sees spin density wave, charge density wave/periodic structural distortion, and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural form which it can engender.

The calculations are based on density functional perturbation theory in the framework of the mixed-basis pseudopotential method. For the undoped parent compound beta-ZrNCl, we are able to identify all structures in the measured phonon-density of states. For the doped system, the partial occupation of the Li site is treated by an artificial doping approach. Doping partially fills a quasi-2D conduction band and gives rise to almost cylindrical Fermi surfaces around the zone boundary K point. The doping induced electron-phonon coupling is also very 2D-like and exhibits a strong momentum-dependent renormalization involving selective phonon modes of in-plane vibrations of Zr and N. Although there is a larger coupling to the higher-frequency N vibrations, the average coupling constant is only approximate to 0.5.

Whereas several samples of beta-ZrNBr and beta-ZrNCl showed reproducibility in the lithium uptake and in the corresponding critical temperatures, different samples of beta-HFNCl subjected to the same treatment in n-buthyllithium showed lithium uptakes ranging from 0.07 to 0.67, and corresponding critical temperatures between 0 and 24 K. A linear dependence of T-c versus the lithium content is observed when all the superconducting samples are considered. The results obtained from electrochemical lithiation are consistent with those obtained with chemical methods, as samples with larger capacity on discharge are also those found to have larger lithium contents after chemical lithiation. Most samples present a reduction step around 1.8 V vs Li-0-Li+ whose origin is still unclear. The electrochemical capacity on discharge for beta-HfNCl and beta-ZrNBr depends on the milling time spent in the preparation of the electrodes, with long milling times resulting in lower intercalation degree.

The pristine compound is a band insulator with the BiS2 layer, which accommodates electron carriers through the La substitution for Sr, as evidenced by the change in x-ray absorption spectra reflecting the occupancy of Bi 6p orbitals. With increasing the carrier density, the resistivity progressively decreases and a bad metallic state appears for x >= 0.45, where bulk superconductivity manifests itself below approximately 3K. The value of T-c gradually increases with decreasing x from 0.6 to 0.45 and immediately decreases down to zero at the critical concentration of x similar to 0.4, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition highly sensitive to the carrier density. Thermodynamic measurements furthermore have revealed the possible enhancement of the superconducting coupling strength as the insulating phase is approached. The obtained superconducting phase diagram is markedly different from the broad dome-shaped superconducting phase previously reported for RO1-xFxBiS2 (R: rare-earth ion), suggesting a strong influence of the blocking layer on the superconductivity. Instead all these features are similar to those observed in Li-intercalated ZrNCl superconductor, except for the critical electron concentration of as low as 6% in the latter compound.

The calculated band structure is consistent with the experimental observations of activated carrier transport, and an indirect optical band gap in beta-ZrNCl and beta-ZrNBr, A simple picture is presented which describes a mechanism for strong electron-phonon coupling in the beta-ZrNX structure, suggesting that beta-LixZrNCl is a classical BCS superconductor.

Linear relations between the enthalpy DeltaH(ox) and nitrogen content were found in all oxynitrides. They indicate that, within the experimental range of nitrogen concentrations, sites occupied by nitrogen ions are energetically equivalent in a given substitutional series. The enthalpies normalized per mole of nitrogen, DeltaH(ox)(n), for compounds of Y-Zr-N-O, Ca-Zr-N-O, and Zr-N-O are similar, about -500 kJ/(mol of N). A more exothermic value of DeltaH(ox)(n), of about -950 kJ/(mol of N), is seen in Mg-Zr-N-O compounds. The energetics of vacancy formation in zirconium oxynitrides was determined and compared to the energetics of vacancy formation in yttria- and calcia-stabilized zirconia. The enthalpy of vacancy formation (enthalpy of formation relative to end members normalized per vacancy) in zirconium oxynitrides (-190.5 +/- 27.0 kJ/mol of Vo) is more exothermic than that in yttria- and calcia-stabilized zirconia (-105 +/- 7.2 and -91.4 +/- 3.8 kJ/mol of Vo, respectively).

Such studies have been performed extensively on graphite, transition-metal dichalcogenides and oxide bronzes(1). Interest in redox intercalation reactions(2) has increased recently because the high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors based on copper oxide also have layered structures, the superconductivity occurring within two-dimensional CuO2 planes separated by charge-reservoir oxide layers(3). Similarly, in metal-doped fullerenes, which show relatively high transition temperatures, the electron donor atoms sit in the interstitial sites between adjacent fullerene balls(4). In a previous study(5), we described a layered nitride, beta-ZrNCl, consisting of Zr-N double layers sandwiched between two close-packed chlorine layers. On lithium intercalation, the crystal changed from a semiconductor to a metal, and became a superconductor at 13 K. Here we report the properties of the isostructural compound beta-HfNCl. After electron-doping the crystal by lithium intercalation, we observe superconductivity with a T-c of up to 25.5 K.

The general compositions of the nitrides are MNX (M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Br, I). The beta-type polymorph consists of MN double layers sandwiched between close-packed halogen layers, which are characterized as semiconductors with a band gap of 3-4 eV. Electrons can be doped to the nitride layers by intercalation of alkali metals between the layers. Upon the intercalation, the compounds become superconductors with the transition temperatures (T(c)s) as high as 13 and 25.5 K for beta-ZrNCl and beta-HfNCl systems, respectively. The T-c of the electron doped beta-HfNCl is higher than that observed in any intermetallic compound and suggests that layered nitrides may exhibit T(c)s comparable to those observed in layer structured complex copper oxide superconductors. The layer structured nitrides can be variously modified by the amounts of doping, the types of alkali metals, and the interlayer separation, which can be controlled by co-intercalation of organic molecules with alkali metals.

The structural and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a combination of resonant valence bond and excitonic insulator physics, and incorporating boson-fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different fashion, the latter leads to some similarities with the high temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The excitonic insulator behaviour sees spin density wave, charge density wave/periodic structural distortion, and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural form which it can engender. It is pointed out that several other notable superconductors, layered in form, semimetallic with indirect overlap and possessing homopolar bonding, would look to fall into the same general category, beta-ZrNCl and MgB2 and the high pressure forms of several elements, like sulfur, phosphorus, lithium and calcium, being cases in point.", "ISSN": "0953-8984", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER", "volume": "22", "authors": ["Wilson, JA"], "issue": "20", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.217002", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 3 2005", "title": "Specific heat measurement of the layered nitride superconductor LixZrNCl", "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.217002", "abstract": "Specific heat has been investigated in a layered nitride superconductor, Li0.12ZrNCl, with T-c=12.7 K.

We present a theoretical investigation of the phonon dispersions and electron-phonon coupling for the undoped and Li-doped ZrNCl, which is one prominent representative of this class of materials. The calculations are based on density functional perturbation theory in the framework of the mixed-basis pseudopotential method. For the undoped parent compound beta-ZrNCl, we are able to identify all structures in the measured phonon-density of states. For the doped system, the partial occupation of the Li site is treated by an artificial doping approach. Doping partially fills a quasi-2D conduction band and gives rise to almost cylindrical Fermi surfaces around the zone boundary K point. The doping induced electron-phonon coupling is also very 2D-like and exhibits a strong momentum-dependent renormalization involving selective phonon modes of in-plane vibrations of Zr and N. Although there is a larger coupling to the higher-frequency N vibrations, the average coupling constant is only approximate to 0.5.

A linear dependence of T-c versus the lithium content is observed when all the superconducting samples are considered.

Most samples present a reduction step around 1.8 V vs Li-0-Li+ whose origin is still unclear. The electrochemical capacity on discharge for beta-HfNCl and beta-ZrNBr depends on the milling time spent in the preparation of the electrodes, with long milling times resulting in lower intercalation degree.

The pristine compound is a band insulator with the BiS2 layer, which accommodates electron carriers through the La substitution for Sr, as evidenced by the change in x-ray absorption spectra reflecting the occupancy of Bi 6p orbitals. With increasing the carrier density, the resistivity progressively decreases and a bad metallic state appears for x >= 0.45, where bulk superconductivity manifests itself below approximately 3K. The value of T-c gradually increases with decreasing x from 0.6 to 0.45 and immediately decreases down to zero at the critical concentration of x similar to 0.4, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition highly sensitive to the carrier density. Thermodynamic measurements furthermore have revealed the possible enhancement of the superconducting coupling strength as the insulating phase is approached. The obtained superconducting phase diagram is markedly different from the broad dome-shaped superconducting phase previously reported for RO1-xFxBiS2 (R: rare-earth ion), suggesting a strong influence of the blocking layer on the superconductivity. Instead all these features are similar to those observed in Li-intercalated ZrNCl superconductor, except for the critical electron concentration of as low as 6% in the latter compound.

The enthalpy of vacancy formation (enthalpy of formation relative to end members normalized per vacancy) in zirconium oxynitrides (-190.5 +/- 27.0 kJ/mol of Vo) is more exothermic than that in yttria- and calcia-stabilized zirconia (-105 +/- 7.2 and -91.4 +/- 3.8 kJ/mol of Vo, respectively). This is consistent with the higher tendency for long-range ordering in zirconium oxynitrides compared to stabilized zirconia. Some technological implications of the results are briefly discussed.", "ISSN": "0884-2914", "pub": "JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH", "volume": "15", "authors": ["Molodetsky, I", "Navrotsky, A", "DiSalvo, F", "Lerch, M"], "issue": "11", "pages": "2558-2570"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0953-8984/14/44/455", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/14/44/455/pdf/0953-8984_14_44_455.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 11 2002", "title": "High-pressure synthesis and crystal structures of beta-MNX (M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Br, I)", "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/14/44/455/", "abstract": "The single crystals of six kinds of metal nitride halide, beta-MNX (M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Br, I), were grown in sealed Au (or Pt) tubes by the reaction of MN or MNX powders with NH4X as fluxes under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions such as 3-5 GPa at 900-1200degreesC.
