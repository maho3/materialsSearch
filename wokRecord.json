The mineral is named colimaite after the locality, which, at the same time, is the current active volcanic crater and the name of the State of Colima (Mexico). Colimaite is the naturally occurring analog of synthetic K3VS4. The mineral formed as a sublimate from the volcanic gases and is associated with cristobalite, arcanite, thenardite, barite and native gold Colimaite occurs in \"hedgehog\"-like particles, which contain the needle crystals, up to 50 mu m length and 20 mu m width. Electron microprobe analyses gave S=43.29 %, K=39.36 %, V=17.41 %, Na=0.43 %, with the sum of 100.49 (wt.%), as the mean of six measurements, previously tested as discordant outlier-free statistical samples. The empirical formula, calculated on the basis of eight atoms, is (K2.95Na0.06)(Sigma 1.03)S-3.97. The idealized formula is K3VS4. The Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) and X-ray powder diffraction data (Cu K alpha radiation) indicated that the structure of the micro-sized particles correspond to the orthorhombic K3VS4 crystalline phase: space group Pnma, with a=9.139(5), b=10.625 (7), c=9.135 (3) angstrom, V=887.03 (9)angstrom(3), and Z=4. The five strongest calculated diffraction lines from this natural compound are [d in angstrom, (I) (hkl)]: 2.806(100)(230), 3.463(73)(220), 2.785(70)(113), 2.928(67)(013), and 2.677 (63)(132). SAED patterns are quite similar to those of the synthetic K3VS4. The calculated density (Z=4) is 2.235 g cm(-3). The main observed Raman bands lie in the region below 500 cm(-1) and the most characteristic bands occur between 150 and 300 cm(-1): 192, 203, 245, 264, 277 and 297 cm(-1).

Large differences in their solubility product constant (K-sp) are crucial for direct exchange in the conversions. In solvothermal reaction of ZnO/CuSe core/shell nanocables with InCI3, the triethylene glycol solvent serves as a reducing agent for the reduction of cupric (Cu2+) to cuprous (Cu+) ions and also as an agent for the dissolution of ZnO cores. The absorption coefficient of the CuInSe2 nanotubes in the visible region is on the order of 10(4) cm(-1).

From X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles, it has been found that Cu2-xSe and Cu3Se2 have cubic and tetragonal structures, respectively. The composition of the chemical constituent in the films has been confirmed from XRD data and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX).

The solid-state reactions observed during the selenisation of three different types of precursors are presented. The first type of precursors (I) consists of the nanocrystalline phases Cu2-xSe and InSe at room temperature, which react to CuInSe2 starting at 470 K. The second type of precursor (II) shows an inhibited CuInSe2 formation out of the initial phases Cu2-xSe and gamma-In2Se3 starting at 400 K. The third precursor type (III) shows completely different selenisation behaviour. Starting from the intermetallic compound Cul(11)In(9) and amorphous selenium, the formation of the binary selenides In4Se3 and CuSe is observed after the melting point of selenium at 494 K. After selenium transfer reactions, the compound semiconductor CuInSe2 is formed out of Cu2-xSe and InSe.

The difference of solubility products (K-sp) of ZnSe and CuSe is the main driving force for the formation of these flower-like nanocomposites. The Cu content greatly influences the physical properties and photocatalytic activity of obtained CuSe-ZnSe nanocomposites. The as-produced CuSe-ZnSe nanocomposites show tremendous enhancements on the photocatalytic degradation ratio of organic dyes methylene orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. The 8 wt.% CuSe-ZnSe sample exhibits the highest degradation ratio for both MO (ca. 100%, 90 min) and MB (ca. 96%, 60 min), which are over 4 times and 2.5 times than that of the pure ZnSe sample, respectively. Based on the data of UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra, XPS and PL spectra, the enhancements of photocatalytic activities of CuSe-ZnSe flower-like nanocomposites are due to the effective separation of photo-electrons and holes induces by the direct initiates interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) from the valence band (VB) of ZnSe to CuSe, which results in the reduction of CuSe to Cu2Se.

Sorption-diffusion from acidified solutions proceeds more intensively: the concentrations of selenium and sulfur diffused from an acidified solution are about 5 times higher as compared with those obtained using a non acidified solution of the same concentration and at the same temperature. The concentration of sorbed selenopentathionate ions increases with increasing the temperature and concentration of K(2)SeS(4)O(6) solution and the duration of treatment. The SeS(4)O(6)(2-) anions diffused into polyamide gradually decompose, and the decomposition products-sulfate ions and SO(2)(-) are washed out from the polymer, but elemental selenium remains in it. Therefore, the polyamide films, depending on the degree of SeS(4)O(6)(2-) ion decomposition, change from colourless to yellow, brown or red. Copper sulfide and copper selenide layers are formed in the surface of polyamide film if the chalcogenized polymer is treated with a water solution of copper(II / I) salt: the anionic particles containing sulfur and selenium atoms of low oxidation state react with the copper ions. The conditions of polymer initial chalcogenation (the concentration and temperature of K(2)SeS(4)O(6) solution) determine the amount of copper and the composition of chalcogenide layer: the content of copper in the polyamide film increases with an increase of the concentration and temperature, and varies from 0.2 . 10(-2) to 33.5 . 10(-2) mg/cm(2). Results of X-ray structural analysis confirmed formation of mixed copper sulfide-copper selenide layers in polyamide surface.

Starting from a general basis-independent formulation, we use Wannier functions as an interface between the two theories. These functions are used for the physical purpose of identifying the correlated orbitals in a specific material, and also for the more technical purpose of interfacing DMFT with different kinds of band-structure methods (with three different techniques being used in the present work). We explore and compare two distinct Wannier schemes, namely the maximally localized Wannier function and the Nth order muffin-tin-orbital methods. Two correlated materials with different degrees of structural and electronic complexity, SrVO3 and BaVS3, are investigated as case studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen here as a test case in view of its simple structure and physical properties. In contrast, the sulfide BaVS3 is known for its rich and complex physics, associated with strong correlation effects and low-dimensional characteristics. Insights into the physics associated with the metal-insulator transition of this compound are provided, particularly regarding correlation-induced modifications of its Fermi surface.

We have made high-resolution ultraviolet-photoemission-spectroscopy (UPS), x-ray-photoemission-spectroscopy, electrical-resistivity, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements on BaVS3. UPS spectra near the Fermi level of the metallic phase exhibit a power-law dependence on the electron binding energy, indicating that conduction electrons in BaVS3 behave as a Luttinger liquid. The power-law exponent is large ( < approximately 1), indicating that electron-electron interaction is long ranged and possibly that electron-phonon interaction is also important. The spectra exhibit gradual changes with temperature. In particular, a semiconducting gap starts to open well above the metal-to-semiconductor transition temperature and fully develops below it. We propose that the gradual orthorhombic distortion of the Jahn-Teller type below approximately 240 K lowers one of the d levels, d(xy), and that below approximately 70 K electrons are fully transferred to the d(xy) band.

From the enhancement of the peak at 1 eV by the He II photon, it is concluded that the V 3d orbitals are strongly incorporated in this peak that is close to the Fermi level. It is shown that the bond-valence-sum method can be useful as a quantitative tool for discussion of XPS results. The possibility of using the bond-valence-sum calculation for discussions on the transport properties of the system is also shown.", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "44", "authors": ["ITTI, R", "WADA, T", "MATSUURA, K", "ITOH, T", "IKEDA, K", "YAMAUCHI, H", "KOSHIZUKA, N", "TANAKA, S"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.44.2306", "issue": "5", "pages": "2306-2312"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.78.035110", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL 2008", "title": "Collective charge excitations below the metal-to-insulator transition in BaVS3\n", "abstract": "The charge response in barium vanadium sulfide (BaVS3) single crystals is characterized by dc resistivity and low-frequency dielectric spectroscopy.

Our analysis indicates that the spin ordering of BaVS3 taking place below 30 K is most probably random along the chain direction. Thus the puzzling properties of BaVS3 are explained in terms of the broken-symmetry electronic state in which pairs of nonmagnetic V atoms alternate with those of magnetic V atoms in each VS3 chain. The origin of this broken-symmetry state was discussed on the basis of cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion and lattice strain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

For low extents of oxidation, alkali ions are removed exclusively to form K1-xNi2Se2. For greater extents of oxidation, the rate of the reaction decreases dramatically, concomitant with the extraction of both potassium and nickel to form K1-xNi2-ySe2. The appreciable mobility of transition metal ions is unexpected, but illustrates the relative energy scales of different defects in the ThCr2Si2 structure type. Furthermore, the fully oxidized compounds, K0.25Ni1.5Se2, spontaneously convert from the tetrahedral [NiSe4]-containing ThCr2Si2 structure to a vacancy-ordered NiAs structure with [NiSe6] octahedra, From analysis of the atom positions and kinetic data, we have determined that this transformation occurs by a continuous, low-energy pathway via subtle displacements of Ni atoms and buckling of the Se sublattice.

All the obtained samples have the nickel arsenide-type hexagonal crystal structure, except CoTe (HP), and their estimated lattice parameters, a and c, show almost the same values within 0.8% in comparison between samples prepared by the QA method and those by the HP method. On the other hand, a distinct difference between samples prepared by QA and HP processes is found in the magnetization of NiSe and NiTe. In particular, for NiTe, the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates two transition temperatures at about 20 and 130 K in samples prepared by the HP process. However, samples of NiTex (x = 0.5, 0.66, 0.82, 1, 1.22, and 2) and NiTe containing Au prepared by QA process do not show similar magnetic orders in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K. Also, samples of NiSe (HP) show magnetic transition at similar to 20 K, while those of NiSe (QA) show a magnetic inflection point at similar to 10 K. To the best of our knowledge the remarkable difference in magnetic properties caused by the method of synthesis has not been reported. In this paper, we present comparative experimental results of magnetic, electric, and specific heat measurements of samples prepared by the two methods. A possible explanation for such a substantial difference in magnetic interaction will be discussed.

Sodium and K ions have the same charge, but different ionic diameters. Sodium and Ca ions have similar ionic diameters, but different charges. Adsorption envelopes were created for these three cations on the four zeolites: zeolite Y, ZSM-5, ferrierite, and mordenite. Comparisons of the magnitudes of the adsorption of Na, K, and Ca on the four zeolites indicated that all cations adsorbed weakly on zeolite Y (large nanopores), Na and K adsorbed strongly on ZSM-5 and ferrierite (medium nanopores) while Ca adsorbed weakly, and all three cations adsorbed strongly on mordenite (small nanopores). It is noteworthy that in the medium nanopores, the two monovalent cations Na and K adsorbed more strongly than Ca, a divalent cation.

These very small dimensions are common in many soil minerals. Using zeolites, the ideal cation for treating sodic soils may be another monovalent cation, such as K +, rather than Ca 2+.

The electronic structures and topologies of the electron densities of Pd2CoSe2 and isotypic Na2CoSe2 are analyzed and compared by using Bader's AIM theory. Different values of topological charge transfer and electron density flatness indices uncover striking quantitative differences in the nature of chemical bonding between the metallic compound Pd2CoSe2 and nonmetallic Na2CoSe2.

All the obtained samples have the nickel arsenide-type hexagonal crystal structure, except CoTe (HP), and their estimated lattice parameters, a and c, show almost the same values within 0.8% in comparison between samples prepared by the QA method and those by the HP method. On the other hand, a distinct difference between samples prepared by QA and HP processes is found in the magnetization of NiSe and NiTe. In particular, for NiTe, the temperature dependence of magnetization indicates two transition temperatures at about 20 and 130 K in samples prepared by the HP process. However, samples of NiTex (x = 0.5, 0.66, 0.82, 1, 1.22, and 2) and NiTe containing Au prepared by QA process do not show similar magnetic orders in the temperature range between 2 and 300 K. Also, samples of NiSe (HP) show magnetic transition at similar to 20 K, while those of NiSe (QA) show a magnetic inflection point at similar to 10 K. To the best of our knowledge the remarkable difference in magnetic properties caused by the method of synthesis has not been reported. In this paper, we present comparative experimental results of magnetic, electric, and specific heat measurements of samples prepared by the two methods. A possible explanation for such a substantial difference in magnetic interaction will be discussed.

We investigate the nature of this magnetic order using magnetization and specific-heat measurements, in addition to powder neutron diffraction. A transition to long-range antiferromagnetic order is found below T-N=8.5 K as identified by magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements, and the emergence of magnetic Bragg reflections with a propagation vector k=0. The low-field magnetic-susceptibility data indicate the presence of weak ferromagnetism in the antiferromagnetic ordered state which saturates in very small fields. Heat-capacity measurements at low temperatures indicate that only about half the configurational entropy is released at T-N. The functional form of the heat capacity below TN suggests the presence of a gap of 6.5 K in the magnon dispersion.

The compounds, which are isostructural with LaCuS,, crystallize with four formula units in the space group P2(1)/c of the monoclinic system. The structure may be thought of as consisting of layers of CuSe4 tetrahedra separated by double layers of LnSe(7) monocapped trigonal prisms along the a-axis.

The excitation spectrum of CaS : Dy consists of two dominant bands at 260 and 280-300 nm. Excitation band at 260 nm is assigned to the band gap energy of CaS, and the 280-300 nm band to the excitation from the acceptor level originated from VCa2+. By analyzing the influence of x in the spectra of Ca1-xLaxS : Dy, the peaks from f-f transition of Dy and bands from the host matrix could be resolved and assigned. Emission spectrum of CaS : Dy prepared in Na2CO3-S flux has sharp peaks from f-f transition, in addition to two broad bands at 525 and 580 nm. The broad band spectrum is associated with defects and vacancies of host material, that is, the peak at 525 nm is from the defect pairs of M-Ca2+(3+)-Na-Ca2+(+) and VS2--VCa2+ and the peak at 580 nm is from the pairs of M-Ca2+(3+)-VCa2+, and VS2--Na-Ca2+(+). The sharp emission peaks at 486, 573, and 665 nm could be assigned to the transition of F-4(9/2) --> H-6(15/2), F-4(9/2) --> H-6(13/2), and F-4(9/2) --> H-6(11/2) of Dy3+, respectively. However, emission spectrum of CaS : Dy prepared in K2CO3-S Aux, shows only the f-f transition of Dy3+. The dependence of the emission intensity ratio, I-yollow/I-blue, of CaS : Dy on Dy3+ concentration and flux was explained. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

[Cf. XXXIX, 4272].\n\nWheat. Several lines from the cross II23584 [(CIANO x Sonora 64-Klein Rendidor) x 8156] outyield the II8156 derivatives and are resistant to the races of  Puccinia graminis var.  tritici, P. striiformis and P.  recondita prevalent in Mexico. Among 800 lines, 53 yielded from 6302 to 9313 kg./ha. and were resistant to disease, lodging and shattering. A total of 42  durum lines outyielded the bread wheat variety Inia 66 and 14 of them yielded more than 8 tons per ha. \n\nNine lines capable of restoring fertility in  Triticum timopheevi cytoplasmically male-sterile lines have been intercrossed and several F 3 to F 5lines show combinations of desirable characteristics, such as high fertility, disease resistance and good agronomic type. Evidence indicates that recessive chromosomal sterility genes, independent of the cytoplasmic restorer genes, influence fertility and three have been isolated in a Norin 10 [Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 10] x Mexican cross. It is suggested that these chromosomal genes may account for instability in restorer systems. Some restorers are effective on only one sterile line, while others appear equally effective on several. Sterile lines also differ in the ease with which fertility is restored. Several promising restorer lines have been derived from Sonora 64 and the spectrum of sterile lines used as females in test crosses has broadened. \n\nLines of bread and  durum wheats showing resistance to  Erysiphe graminis in Tunisia are listed, together with varieties showing field resistance to  Septoria sp. in Mexico. \n\nHexaploid triticale plants derived from a three-way cross, have a high degree of fertility and studies showed this to be heritable. Other fertile lines have plump grain. Details are given of the variability in floret fertility, seed weight and plumpness in triticales,  durum and bread wheats. New octoploid triticales have been developed by initially crossing bread wheat and rye and improved embryo-culture techniques have circumvented former difficulties in developing hexaploid types. \n\nMaize. The new hybrids ICAH208 and ICAH255 are adapted to lowland areas in Columbia. Unnamed varieties produced in Ecuador yield 10-20% more than VS2 and are shorter. Native germ plasm from the Caribbean has been combined with Mexican and Central American germ plasm to develop varieties for warm humid tropical areas. This germ plasm has also been used in East Africa in crosses with local varieties and in the development of composites. Promising high yielding composites reported include Zambia Composite A, Chitedze Composite A from Malawi, Kawanda Composite A developed in Uganda and Ilonga Composite A in Tanzania. Hybrids H632 from Kitale and the Zambian SR52 averaged over 40% higher yields than local varieties in localities throughout East Africa.\n\nSelection has been made more effective by recombining S 1 lines from yield trials in the first nursery generation. These are planted at high densities and plants which are unproductive under stress are eliminated. Selection for agronomic characters is also made in the nursery generations. \n\nIn Egypt, the local varieties Na-El-Gamal and American Early Dent combined well with Central American and US germ plasm. A white selection of Jl also performed well.\n\nIn Thailand, a study showed that early or latematuring types can be developed by mass selection without adversely affecting yield. Genetic studies of resistance to  Curvularia lunata[Cochliobolus lunatus] showed that a polygenic system combining additive, dominance and epistatic gene effects is involved. The new releases in Indonesia, Harapan, Bogor Composite 2 and Bogor Composite 4, outyield Metro. \n\nGanga 5, a new yellow-flint hybrid released in India, is early maturing, high yielding and resistant to  Sclerophthora rayssiae var.  zeae. The composite A1 x Antigua Group I showed resistance to  Chilo partellus. Genetic studies showed that resistance to maize mosaic virus is governed by a single recessive gene with incomplete dominance for susceptibility. Another study showed that additive and nonadditive gene effects are involved in the inheritance of resistance to  Helmintho-sporium maydis (Cochliobolus heterostrophus). The results indicated that some recessives confer resistance but for each recessive, there are about two partially dominant genes. \n\nThe effect of plant density on selection for yield, ear height, number of days to flowering, tillers per plant, and ears per plant was studied. Additive genetic variance for each character except ear height declined with increased plant density. Nonadditive genetic variance for yield selected under high density was approximately one third of that selected under low density, and the same trend was observed for the other characters except days to flowering. Total genetic variance for yield under the high plant density was about a quarter of that under low and the same trend was observed in the other characters except days to flowering. Heritability for yield under high density was estimated as about half that for low density and a similar trend was noted for days to flowering and tillers per plant. It appears that selection for low-eared plants may be more effective with a high plant density. The results suggest that undesirable indirect responses to selection can be reduced by changing the environment. Ear height is affected by selection for earliness whether in high or low density populations. Estimates are given of the direct and indirect gains from mass selection for yield. The expected gain from direct selection for yield was higher per plant with low density populations. Further studies of selection for lodging resistance based on weight of stalk section and rind thickness suggest that the latter produces the biggest differences.\n\nA study of seven varieties showed that Pepitilla required 115 days before flowering when planted in April and 88 days when planted in June, compared with 73.5 and 71 days respectively for Tabloncillo.\n\nOf 200 varieties, the 60 showing most resistance to thrips ( Frankliniella wilhamsi) damage were allowed to interpollinate producing a population designated Thrips Resistant Synthetic (Tep67-68). Studies suggest that resistance is a recessive character. In breeding for stem borer,  Zeadiatraea and  Diatraea spp., resistance, the best varieties for crossing combine high resistance and high genetic variability in relation to resistance, and the best varieties assessed on this basis are listed. As the heritability of resistance estimates are low it is considered desirable to infect artificially the material to be tested. A comparison between degrees of borer damage in early and advanced generations of varieties developed in the absence of selection for resistance indicated that susceptibility may tend to increase. \n\nTests with 216 Brazilian and 71 Colombian varieties showed considerable differences in reaction to  Sitophilus zeamais. Weevil emergence was less in the Brazilian varieties: B59, B122, B114, B7 and B212, and in the Colombian: C5 Pira Blanco, C9 Pira naranja, C11 Narino 369, C19 Magdalena 443, C23 Magdalena 466, C124 Diacol V254, C128 Eto x Peru (Blanco) and C132. \n\nStudies with the genes floury-2 and opaque-2 suggest that the former may be better than the latter for improving protein quality and content.\n\nA method is outlined for counting somatic chromosomes using 8-hydroxyquinoline and snail stomach cytase. Further work with B chromosomes confirmed the manner of their transmission, and variations in morphological or physiological characters were found to be related to variation in the number of B chromosomes. Thus, as the number increased male flowering was later and plants were shorter. Genetic studies of the characters square stalk and twin stalks showed that square-stalked x normal crosses produced shorter than normal plants with shortness partially dominant. Inheritance in the square-stalked type is however complex and three phenotypes were ound: normal, square-stalked, and a square twin-stalked type. The genetic basis for the latter is discussed. Chromosome morphology studies produced limited data suggesting that maize in the USA is basically a product of at least four knob complexes: Mesa Central knobless, Eastern Mexico, Zapalote and Southern Guatemala.

Main structural features are almost regular GeSe4-, but distorted CuSe4- or AgSe4-tetrahedra sharing corners or edges. Eight selenium atoms coordinate the alkaline earth atoms in the voids of these three dimensional tetrahedral networks. Chemical bonding and the electronic structure are elucidated by self-consistent band structure calculations and the COHP method. The electron density and the electron localization function ELF of SrCu2GeSe4 reveal a significant stronger covalent character for the Ge-Se bonds compared with the Cu-Se bonds. For this reason the GeSe4 tetrahedra appear as quasi molecular entities, arranged spatially according to the motifs of closest packing. The metal atoms occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral voids of these \"tetrahedra packing\".

The nature and values of the spin exchange parameters deduced from this analysis depend on what spin exchange paths one includes in the spin Hamiltonian. In this article, we review how spin exchange interactions of magnetic solids with localized spins are described on formal, quantitative and qualitative theoretical levels, investigate antisymmetric and anisotropic interactions for general spin dimers, and discuss the spin exchange interactions and magnetic structures of various extended magnetic solids on the basis of spin dimer analysis. Strongly interacting spin exchange paths of a magnetic solid are determined by the overlap between its magnetic orbitals, so that the strongly interacting spin unit of a magnetic solid does not necessarily have the same geometrical feature as does the arrangement of its magnetic ions or spin-carrying molecules. Therefore, in interpreting results of magnetic susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering or Raman scattering measurements, it is essential to employ a set of spin exchange parameters chosen on the basis of proper electronic structure considerations. Spin dimer analyses based on extended Huckel tight binding calculations provide a reliable and expedient means to study the relative strengths of superexchange and super-superexchange spin exchange interactions.

Starting from a general basis-independent formulation, we use Wannier functions as an interface between the two theories. These functions are used for the physical purpose of identifying the correlated orbitals in a specific material, and also for the more technical purpose of interfacing DMFT with different kinds of band-structure methods (with three different techniques being used in the present work). We explore and compare two distinct Wannier schemes, namely the maximally localized Wannier function and the Nth order muffin-tin-orbital methods. Two correlated materials with different degrees of structural and electronic complexity, SrVO3 and BaVS3, are investigated as case studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen here as a test case in view of its simple structure and physical properties. In contrast, the sulfide BaVS3 is known for its rich and complex physics, associated with strong correlation effects and low-dimensional characteristics. Insights into the physics associated with the metal-insulator transition of this compound are provided, particularly regarding correlation-induced modifications of its Fermi surface.

We have made high-resolution ultraviolet-photoemission-spectroscopy (UPS), x-ray-photoemission-spectroscopy, electrical-resistivity, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements on BaVS3. UPS spectra near the Fermi level of the metallic phase exhibit a power-law dependence on the electron binding energy, indicating that conduction electrons in BaVS3 behave as a Luttinger liquid. The power-law exponent is large ( < approximately 1), indicating that electron-electron interaction is long ranged and possibly that electron-phonon interaction is also important. The spectra exhibit gradual changes with temperature. In particular, a semiconducting gap starts to open well above the metal-to-semiconductor transition temperature and fully develops below it. We propose that the gradual orthorhombic distortion of the Jahn-Teller type below approximately 240 K lowers one of the d levels, d(xy), and that below approximately 70 K electrons are fully transferred to the d(xy) band. The d(xy) band then becomes half-filled, resulting in the opening of a Mott-Hubbard gap.", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "49", "authors": ["NAKAMURA, M", "SEKIYAMA, A", "NAMATAME, H", "FUJIMORI, A", "YOSHIHARA, H", "OHTANI, T", "MISU, A", "TAKANO, M"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.49.16191", "issue": "23", "pages": "16191-16201"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.61.R7831", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 15 2000", "title": "Orbitally driven spin pairing in the three-dimensional nonmagnetic Mott insulator BaVS3: Evidence from single-crystal studies", "abstract": "Static electrical and magnetic properties of single crystal BaVS3 were measured over the structural (T-S=240 K), metal insulator (T-MI=69 K), and suspected orbital ordering (T-X=30 K) transitions.

The on-site Coulomb repulsion has also been taken into account in the GGA+U approach to unravel the correlation effects on the electronic structure. We found that in the high-temperature hexagonal structure the partially filled t(2g) conduction bands including the broad d(3z(2)-r(2)) and two narrow e(t(2g)) orbitals contribute to the conductivity of BaVS3, suggesting a weak anisotropy in the electronic transport. Furthermore, our GGA+U band structure calculations predict an insulating ground state with a narrow gap of 0.15 eV for BaVS3 in the low-temperature (60 K) orthorhombic structure, thereby indicating the Mott-Hubbard mechanism for the low-temperature insulating behavior. Our total energy analyses of the ground-state spin configuration in the low-temperature phases show that the magnetic structure with an intrachain ferromagnetic spin arrangement and an interchain antiferromagnetic spin arrangement that is consistent with a superexchange mechanism through sulfur 3 p orbitals is preferred. We have also estimated the values of exchange integrals by mapping the calculated total energies onto the Heisenberg spin model. It is found that the stronger exchange interaction is ferromagnetic intrachain coupling, while the weaker antiferromagnetic interchain coupling occurs along the a axis. A substantial magnetic anisotropy is found and results in the observed quasi-1D magnetic character in BaVS3.

The physical implications of such interorbital charge transfers are then explored in two case studies: BaVS3 and NaxCoO2.

Above the critical pressure, p(cr)similar to 20 kbar, metallic spectra were recorded in the whole temperature range, as expected from the shape of the phase diagram.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "71", "authors": ["Kezsmarki, I", "Mihaly, G", "Gaal, R", "Barisic, N", "Berger, H", "Forro, L", "Homes, CC", "Mihaly, L"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.193103", "issue": "19", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.167203", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 21 2011", "title": "Ground State of the Quasi-1D Compound BaVS3 Resolved by Resonant Magnetic X-Ray Scattering", "abstract": "Resonant magnetic x-ray scattering near the vanadium L-2,L-3-absorption edges has been used to investigate the low temperature magnetic structure of high quality BaVS3 single crystals.

These increased bonding interactions are responsible for the unexpected anisotropic contraction of the lattice parameters with falling temperature.", "ISSN": "0020-1693", "pub": "INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA", "volume": "206", "authors": ["BENSCH, W", "KOY, J"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020169300828704", "issue": "2", "pages": "221-223"}, {"DOI": "10.1006/jssc.1999.8168", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459699981689/pdf?md5=4b3f9f23458423c1a0a9a7960484e853&pid=1-s2.0-S0022459699981689-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 1999", "title": "A powder neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of FeV2S4", "abstract": "Variable-temperature powder neutron diffraction data demonstrate that FeV2S4 undergoes a transition to a long-range magnetically ordered state at 135(7) K, in agreement with magnetic susceptibility data, High-resolution neutron diffraction data collected at 1.9 K reveal that magnetic ordering results in a doubling of the crystallographic unit-cell dimensions (I2/m a = 5.8302(2), b = 3.2761(1), c = 11.2398(4) Angstrom, beta = 92.046(2)degrees) in the a and c directions and that the magnetic structure is described by a propagation vector of (1/2, 0, 1/2).

The crystal flakes have trigonal symmetry with 2c and incommensurate >2(root3)a superlattice ordering in the a-b plane. As-grown flakes showed complex irreversible behaviour in resistivity on cycling to low temperatures, related to the metastability of the structure. The annealing of the crystal flakes and addition of 5-10% Al stabilizes the superstructure. We observe an anomalous contribution to the resistance of these crystal flakes with a maximum around 100-150 K. The contribution is more pronounced for better-ordered phases. The magnetic susceptibility and thermopower values of these compounds are large and vary smoothly on cooling around this temperature interval. The polycrystalline phase, obtained at a higher temperature, on the other hand, showed absence of superlattice distortions and gave a smooth behaviour in its resistance, but with a large T-2-contribution. The structural and electronic properties of different phases are discussed in terms of disorder among the interstitial V atoms and the effect of in-plane vacancies on the charge-density-wave instability in these and similar compounds.", "ISSN": "0953-8984", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER", "volume": "14", "authors": ["Poddar, P", "Rastogi, AK"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "10", "pages": "2677-2689"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0022-3697(02)00258-5", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022369702002585/pdfft?md5=1b4244170f5c150161f46d79d7c6a991&pid=1-s2.0-S0022369702002585-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 2003", "title": "Polymorphism in Cu-substituted GaV4S8: structural and electronic properties", "abstract": "The hexagonal and cubic phases of Ga1-xCuV4S8 are obtained by different methods of preparation. The reaction of elements above 900 degreesC gives hexagonal phases for large range of x = 0.02-0.5. These are metallic and show enhanced paramagnetism. The reduction of oxides by H2S at a lower temperature of 700 degreesC gives non-stoichiornertic compositions of cubic-V-4 cluster compound GaV4S8. The solubility of Cu-atoms in cubic phase is less than 10% and above x = 0.2 the samples contain a mixture of phases, CuxVS2, GaxVS2 and CuGaS2. The cubic phases are insulating and show Mott's Variable Range Hopping conduction. The non-stoichiomerty and the Cu-substitution reduce the resistivity and thermopower. For x = 0.15 and 0.20, the additional peaks are observed in X-ray patterns. These compositions showed a sharp metal to insulator transition on cooling below 180 K. The transitional behaviour is very similar to that previously reported intercalated VS2 compound AlxVS2. The transport and magnetic properties of these phases are discussed in terms of the clustering interactions among V-atoms and the localisation of carriers on the metallic clusters frequently found in V-chalcogenides.

The room-temperature space group has been deduced by convergent-beam electron diffraction to be Cmc2(1) (No. 36).  A second-order phase transition has been found to occur at approximately 250 K and below the transition the space group is Pmc2(1) (No. 26).  The structures at 298 and approximately 120 K have been refined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and the Rietveld method has been used to refine the structure at 13 K from powder X-ray diffraction data.  The room-temperature structure [M(r) = 203.48, a = 4.059 (2), b = 6.617 (4), c = 7.967 (2) angstrom, V = 213.97 (20) angstrom 3, Z = 4, D(x) = 6.32 g cm-3, lambda(Mo K-alpha) = 0.71069 angstrom, mu = 196 cm-1, F(000) = 368, T = 298 K, R = 0.061, wR = 0.059 for 278 reflections] is based on distorted hexagonal close packing of S atoms.  The Cu atoms lie in trigonal coordination coplanar with the hexagonally packed sulfur layers.  These layers are bridged by two-coordinate Ag atoms, which have large and highly anisotropic thermal motion and are bonded with near linear geometry to sulfur.

Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X-ray methods. The dark red semiconductors crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space groups. SrCu2GeSe4 (Ama2, a = 10.807(4) Angstrom, b = 10.735(4) Angstrom, c = 6.541(2) Angstrom, Z = 4) forms a new structure type, whereas BaCu2GeSe4 (P3(1), a = 6.490(1) Angstrom, c = 16.355(3) Angstrom, Z = 3) and BaAg2GeSe4 (I222, a = 7.058(1) Angstrom, b = 7.263(1) Angstrom, c = 8.253(2) Angstrom, Z = 2) crystallize in structures known from thiostannates. Main structural features are almost regular GeSe4-, but distorted CuSe4- or AgSe4-tetrahedra sharing corners or edges. Eight selenium atoms coordinate the alkaline earth atoms in the voids of these three dimensional tetrahedral networks. Chemical bonding and the electronic structure are elucidated by self-consistent band structure calculations and the COHP method. The electron density and the electron localization function ELF of SrCu2GeSe4 reveal a significant stronger covalent character for the Ge-Se bonds compared with the Cu-Se bonds. For this reason the GeSe4 tetrahedra appear as quasi molecular entities, arranged spatially according to the motifs of closest packing. The metal atoms occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral voids of these \"tetrahedra packing\". This concept allows to derive the structures of AM(2)GeSe(4)-compounds from simple binary structure types as Li3Bi or Ni2In.", "ISSN": "0044-2313", "pub": "ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANORGANISCHE UND ALLGEMEINE CHEMIE", "volume": "627", "authors": ["Tampier, M", "Johrendt, D"], "issue": "3", "pages": "312-320"}]], "topic:CrAgS2 or topic:Cr1Ag1S2": [{"icsd_ids": [42395, 42396, 24797, 604981], "energy": -22.6018342, "unit_cell_formula": {"Cr": 1.0, "S": 2.0, "Ag": 1.0}, "oxide_type": "None", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%224BTPc92C16h7dmOcKLc%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "hubbards": {}, "task_ids": ["mp-669530", "mp-689375", "mp-689573", "mp-4182"], "band_gap": 0.7286999999999999, "density": 5.013361880265575, "nsites": 4, "icsd_id": null, "elements": ["Ag", "Cr", "S"], "tags": ["Silver dithiochromate(III)", "Silver chromium sulfide", "Silver chromium sulfide (1/1/2)"], "pretty_formula": "CrAgS2", "volume": 74.19198177101208, "total_magnetization": 3.0, "is_hubbard": false, "formation_energy_per_atom": -0.46894668203125, "cif": "#\\#CIF1.1\n##########################################################################\n#               Crystallographic Information Format file \n#               Produced by PyCifRW module\n# \n#  This is a CIF file.

Using the electronic five-orbital Hubbard model first-principles techniques to calculate the electronic hopping amplitudes between irons, and the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation to handle the many-body effects, here it is shown that the exotic block-AFM state is indeed stable at realistic electronic densities close to n similar to 6.0. Another state with parallel spins along the rungs and antiparallel along the legs of the ladders (the \"CX\" state) is close in energy. This state becomes stable in other portions of the phase diagrams, such as with hole doping, as also found experimentally via neutron scattering applied to KFe2Se3. In addition, the present study unveils other competing magnetic phases that could be experimentally stabilized by varying either n chemically or the electronic bandwidth by pressure.

At 300 K, however, a substantial broadening of the spectra is observed at low-energy loss, which is consistent with the closure of the antiferromagnetic band gap.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "88", "authors": ["Monney, C", "Uldry, A", "Zhou, KJ", "Krzton-Maziopa, A", "Pomjakushina, E", "Strocov, VN", "Delley, B", "Schmitt, T"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.165103", "issue": "16", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/0953-8984/25/31/315403", "pdflink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/25/31/315403/pdf/0953-8984_25_31_315403.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 7 2013", "title": "Crystal structure of BaFe2Se3 as a function of temperature and pressure: phase transition phenomena and high-order expansion of Landau potential", "abstract": "\nBaFe2Se3 (Pnma, CsAg2I3-type structure), recently assumed to show superconductivity at similar to 11 K, exhibits a pressure-dependent structural transition to the CsCu2Cl3-type structure (Cmcm space group) around 60 kbar, as evidenced from pressure-dependent synchrotron powder diffraction data. Temperature-dependent synchrotron powder diffraction data indicate an evolution of the room-temperature BaFe2Se3 structure towards a high-symmetry CsCu2Cl3 form upon heating. Around 425 K BaFe2Se3 undergoes a reversible, first-order isostructural transition, which is supported by the differential scanning calorimetry data. The temperature-dependent structural changes occur in two stages, as determined by the alignment of the FeSe4 tetrahedra and corresponding adjustments of the positions of Ba atoms. On further heating, a second-order phase transformation into the Cmcm structure is observed at 660 K. A rather unusual combination of isostructural and second-order phase transformations is parameterized within phenomenological theory assuming high-order expansion of the Landau potential.

The intensities (DELTAT) and enthalpies (DELTAH) of the phase transitions decrease with increasing mechanical treatment and with increasing Fe incorporation into the structums as well. An iron addition in the synthesis of Cu sulfides of mom than 6.5 weight-% leads to the formation of a new phase of composition Cu1.8-1.7Fe0.2-0.3S.

The spectra of these metal sulfides are interpreted based on qualitative molecular orbital (MO) - energy-band models, and indicate that the metal 3d crystal-field band below the conduction band minimum has significant S 3s- and 3p-like density of states (DOS), because of strong participation of the metal 3d electrons in the bonding of the metals with sulfur. The S K- and L-edge spectra of sulfates are interpreted using MO theory. The S K- and L-edges shift to higher energy by about 10 eV from sulfides (S-2-) to sulfur (S-0), sulfite (S4+) and sulfates (S6+), providing a powerful and independent technique for the determination of oxidation state of sulfur. For semiconducting metal sulfides, the S K- and L-edges shift linearly to higher energy by 2-3 eV with increase in the energy band gap E(g)), and curvilinearly to lower energy with increase in reflectivity.", "ISSN": "0008-4476", "pub": "CANADIAN MINERALOGIST", "volume": "33", "authors": ["LI, D", "BANCROFT, GM", "KASRAI, M", "FLEET, ME", "FENG, XH", "TAN, K"], "issue": "N/A", "pages": "949-960"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/es902091w", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1219929325129/esthag-masthead.pdf", "pubDate": "FEB 15 2010", "title": "Competition between Disordered Iron Sulfide and Natural Organic Matter Associated Thiols for Mercury(II)-An EXAFS Study", "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es902091w", "abstract": "Knowledge about the chemical speciation of Hg(II) is a prerequisite for a proper understanding of biogeochemical processes in control of the transformation of Hg(II) into toxic and bioaccumulating monomethyl mercury. Of critical importance are structures and the stability of Hg(II)-complexes with inorganic and organic sulfur ligands in aqueous and solid phases of soils and sediments. On the basis of Hg L(III)-edge EXAFS experiments, we report Hg(II) to form a four-coordinated metacinnabar [beta-HgS(s)] phase when reacted with disordered FeS(s) (mackinawite), at pH 9.0 and a Hg(II) to FeS(s) molar ratio of 0.002-0.012. When Hg(II) (1000-20 000 mu g Hg g(-1)) was added to mixtures of <5 days of aged FeS(s) (2-20%) and an organic soil at pH 5.7-6.1, a mixture of Hg(II) coordinated with two organic thiols [Hg(SR)(2)] and Hg(II) coordinated with four inorganic sulfides in a metacinnabar-like phase was formed. Surface complex formation between Hg(II) and FeS(s), or substitution of Hg(II) for Fe(II) in FeS(s), was not observed. Guantities of beta-HgS(s) and Hg(SR)(2) formed (as determined by EXAFS) were in fair agreement with theoretical thermodynamic calculations, as described by the reaction: Hg(SR)(2) + FeS(s) = HAS) + Fe(2+) + 2RS(-). The calculated stability constant for this reaction (log K = -16.1 - -15.4) supports a strong bonding of Hg(II) to organic thiols, corresponding to a log beta(2) for the formation of Hg(SR)(2) on the order of 42 or greater.", "ISSN": "0013-936X", "pub": "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY", "volume": "44", "authors": ["Skyllberg, U", "Drott, A"], "issue": "4", "pages": "1254-1259"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jcis.2005.06.049", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979705007095/pdfft?md5=b456c4199d118ca37fec64374feb0657&pid=1-s2.0-S0021979705007095-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 1 2006", "title": "Sorption of Sr(II) and Eu(III) onto pyrite under different redox potential conditions", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979705007095", "abstract": "Understanding sorption processes is fundamental for the prediction of radionuclide migration in the surroundings of a deep geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes. Pyrite (FeS2) is a mineral phase often present as inclusions in temperate soils. Moreover, it constitutes an indirect corrosion product of steel, a containment material that is candidate to confine radionuclides in deep geological disposals. The present study was thus initiated to determine the capacity of pyrite to immobilize Sr(II) and Eu(III). An air oxidized pyrite and a freshly acid-washed (non-oxidized) pyrite were used in background electrolytes of varying reducing-oxidizing ability (NaCl, NH3OHCl, and NaClO4) to study the sorption of both cationic species. The sorptive capacity of pyrite appeared directly correlated to the oxidation of the surface. Non-oxidized pyrite had nearly no affinity for the studied cations whereas Sr(II) and Eu(III) species were significantly retained by oxidized pyrite surface. Using the surface complexation theory, sorption mechanisms were modeled with the FITEQL v3.2 and the JCHESs 2.0 codes. Sorption of both Sr and Eu was well fitted, assuming hydroxylated species as the major surface species. This study demonstrates that not only the components of a barrier but also the redox conditions and speciations should be well characterized to predict transport of contaminants in the surrounding of a nuclear wastes disposal.

From this screening procedure, we find that the group II elements (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) and Cd have higher band gaps in the pyrite structure than FeS2. Practical band gap enhancement is observed only in the Ru and Os alloyed systems, but their incorporation into pyrite may be severely limited by the large positive enthalpy of mixing.

The plant was small, and the woody axes were narrow and permineralized in pyrite (FeS2). We used standard palaeobotanical methods and employed propagation phase contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SR mu CT) to create three-dimensional images of the wood and to evaluate its properties. The xylem comprised tracheids and rays, which developed from a cambium. Tracheids possessed an early extinct type of scalariform bordered pitting known as P-type. Our observations indicate that wood evolved initially in plants of small stature that were members of Euphyllophytina, a clade that includes living seed plants, horsetails and ferns. Hydraulic properties were calculated from measurements taken from the PPC-SR mu CT images. The specific hydraulic conductivity of the xylem area was calculated as 8.7 kg m(-1) s(-1) and the mean cell thickness-to-span ratio (t/b)(2) of tracheids was 0.0372. The results show that the wood was suited to high conductive performance with low mechanical resistance to hydraulic tension. We argue that axis rigidity in the earliest woody plants initially evolved through the development of low-density woods.

In particular, LixV2O5 has attracted attention as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries owing to its large theoretical capacity, but its stable electrochemical cycling (i.e., reversibility) still remains as a challenge and strongly depends on its synthesis methods. In this study, we prepared the LixV2O5 from electrochemical ion exchange of beta-Na0.33V2O5, which is obtained by chemical conversion of NaVS2 in air at high temperatures. Crystal structure and particle morphology of beta-Na0.33V2O5 are characterized by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in combination with electrochemical data, suggest that Na ions are extracted from beta-Na0.33V2O5 without irreversible structural collapse and replaced with Li ions during the following intercalation (i.e., charging) process. The thus obtained LixV2O5 delivers a high discharge capacity of 295 mAh g(-1)), which corresponds to x = 2, with crystal structural stability in the voltage range of 1.5-4.0 V versus.

Furthermore, the ion-exchanged LixV2O5 from beta-Na0.33V2O5 shows stable electrochemical behavior without structural collapse, even at a case of deep discharge to 1.5 V versus Li.", "ISSN": "1944-8244", "pub": "ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES", "volume": "7", "authors": ["Kim, JK", "Senthilkumar, B", "Sahgong, SH", "Kim, JH", "Chi, MF", "Kim, Y"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b01260", "issue": "12", "pages": "7025-7032"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.032", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468614016557/pdfft?md5=5afdebea280803d3963d6ff6a105f8e8&pid=1-s2.0-S0013468614016557-main.pdf", "pubDate": "OCT 10 2014", "title": "Comparative electrochemical sodium insertion/extraction behavior in layered NaxVS2 and NaxTiS2", "abstract": "This study investigates the electrochemical sodium insertion/extraction of NaxVS2, and NaxTiS2 in the voltage range where either intercalation (0.2 <= x <= 1) or displacement-conversion reaction (x > 1) occurs. Both NaxVS2 and NaxTiS2 showed good reversible capacities, as high as similar to 160 mAh/g at an average voltage of similar to 1.9 V vs. Na in the region for the intercalation reaction (0.2 <= x <= 1). When sodium (Na) insertion was forced further to the x > 1 composition, NaxVS2 exhibited the direct displacement-conversion reaction at 0.3 V vs. Na without further Na intercalation, which contrasted with the wider lithium intercalation range of 0 < x <= 2 for LixVS2. The displacement-conversion reaction for NaxVS2 (x > 1) was reversible with a specific capacity of above 200 mAh/g up to 15 cycles, but the displacement reaction for NaxTiS2 (x > 1) was not observed.

The crystal structure was determined from diffractometer data and refined to a conventional R of 0.017 (746 Fo's, 75 variables). Na3VS4 crystallizes with a new structure type. The crystal structure is characterized by discrete tetrahedral complex anions [VS4](3-) which are close to T-d-symmetry and are connected by two Na+ cations to form fourfold groups.
