The degree of curvature size, shape, and charge of the mixed valence {V5O9(PO4)(2)} V(4+/5+) pentameric building block, which resembles a portion of and arc of a circle, favors the formation of very large cavities. Phosphate 1 crystallizes in space group <I(4)over bar 3m> with a = 26.247(3) Angstrom and has very large cubic-shaped cavities that display <(4)over bar 3m> point symmetry, each of which enclose nearly 50 positive charges. These charges are distributed among 12 HN(CH2CH2)(3)NH2+, 32 K+ cations, and several waters of crystallization. Each cavity, which could contain a sphere of approximately 13.0 Angstrom diameter and which displays an enormous 32-ring at its maximum diameter, communicates via six 16-ring windows to other similar supercages via intervening smaller cavities. Phosphate 2 is built up from the same pentamers as those in 1 but arranged in a different manner in space group <Fd(3)over bar m> with a 32.306(4) Angstrom such that one pentamer lies on each of the six faces of a cube. The three-dimensional structure of 2 consists of two types of cavity, larger ones with all six pentamers curved in an outward fashion, with a free diameter along the diagonal of the cubic-shaped cavity of approximately 20 Angstrom and exhibiting a 24-ring diameter, and smaller ones with all six curved to the inside with cavity diagonals of 7.5 Angstrom.

The coordination of polyhedra or units around a vertex is visualized by connecting the centres of the atoms or groups at the vertices connected with the central vertex. Thus, the concept of coordination number is extended to include coordinating groups. We name a net after a homeomorphic simple structure-type for which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the net and specific atoms of the structure, and between the edges of the net and the chemical bonds. We term the resulting more complex structures metastructures in order to distinguish them from their corresponding simple structure-types.

Physicochemical studies have shown that at low vanadium content, polymeric V-O-V chains are stabilized on the ceria surface. Increasing the vanadium content tends to favor the formation of the CeVO4 and V2O5 phases. The redox properties of these oxides have been simultaneously investigated by TPR/TPO and EPR techniques. V-O-V chains and V2O5 species are more easily reducible than the CeVO4 phase. The reduction Of V2O5 to V2O3 proceeds in several steps, the intermediate species being V6O13, VO2 and V5O9. The reduction Of V2O5 species interacting with ceria support leads to VO oxide. EPR measurements performed at T= -269 degrees C have permitted to observe progressively different signals of V4+ in addition to vanadium ions in V2+ (3d(3)) paramagnetic configuration. This attribution is based on an EPR signal at g = 3.956 with eight well resolved hyper fine lines (A = 96 Gauss), which may be attributed to the perpendicular components of one of the fine transitions corresponding to the V2+ spectrum. At high reduction temperature, CeVO4 phase leads in one step to CeVO3 and a continuous and partial reduction of CeO2 into Ce2O3 is observed. Re-oxidation process shows that polymeric V-O-V chains, easily reducible, are hardly re-oxidized whereas V2O5 species, present in the high vanadium loading samples, are easily re-oxidized at low temperatures. However, redox processes seem to be reversible.

Annealing in oxygen gas at 800 degrees C transformed the metallic NPs to oxide NPs. While the mean diameter of the metal V NPs was 8.4 nm in the as-implanted state, the diameters steeply increased during oxidation, with some exceeding 100 nm. Since at least 15 different composition phases, such as V2O3, V3O7, V6O13, V9O17, etc., are known for vanadium oxides, identification of the oxide phase of the NPs was not easy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was not a powerful tool for phase identification of the NPs, because the diffraction peaks were broad due to the nanometric sizes of the particles and readily shift due to stress effects. The temperature dependence of the optical absorption spectrum was measured. The observed spectra were almost unchanged between 33 and 370 K. Combining the spectral result and the XRD results, the candidates were narrowed down to three phases, V2O5, V4O9, and V7O13, from the 15 candidates.

DFT calculations of the pathways for VO3+C2H4 and VO3+C2H2 reaction systems indicate that the reactions VO3+C2H4 -> VO2CH2 + H2CO and VO3+C2H2 -> VO2C2 + H2O are thermodynamically favorable and overall barrierless at room temperature, in good agreement with the experimental observations.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "130", "authors": ["Dong, F", "Heinbuch, S", "Xie, Y", "Rocca, JJ", "Bernstein, ER", "Wang, ZC", "Deng, K", "He, SG"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja076007z", "issue": "6", "pages": "1932-1943"}, {"DOI": "10.1039/b402873b", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2004", "title": "Structure and reactivity of V2O5: bulk solid, nanosized clusters, species supported on silica and alumina, cluster cations and anions", "abstract": "Vanadyl bond dissociation energies are calculated by density functional theory (DFT). While the hybrid (B3LYP) functional results are close to the available reference data, gradient corrected functionals (BP86, PBE) yield large errors (about 50 to 100 kJ mol(-1)), but reproduce trends correctly. PBE calculations on a V20O62H24 cluster model for the (001) surface of V2O5 crystals virtually reproduce periodic slab calculations. The low bond dissociation energy (formation of oxygen surface defect) of 113 kJ mol(-1) (B3LYP) is due to substantial structure relaxations leading to formation of V-O-V bonds between the V2O5 layers of the crystal. This relaxation cannot occur in polyhedral (V2O5)(n) clusters and also not for V2O5 species supported on silica or alumina (represented by cage-type models) for which bond dissociation energies of 250-300 kJ mol(-1) are calculated. The OV(OCH3)(3) molecule and its dimer are also considered. Radical cations V2O5+ and V4O10+ have very low bond dissociation energies (22 and 14 kJ mol(-1), respectively), while the corresponding radical anions have higher dissociation energies (about 330 kJ mol(-1)) than the neutral clusters. The bond dissociation energies of the closed shell V3O7+ cation (165 kJ mol(-1)) and the closed shell V3O8- anion (283 kJ mol(-1)) are closest to the values of the neutral clusters.

The reactions of V3O7+ with the isomers of butene (1-butene, cis-2-butene and traps-2-butene) display many of the same reaction pathways that are observed for 1,3-butadiene, namely, oxidation of the hydrocarbon, oxidative dehydrogenation, and molecular association.

The clusters were embedded in a set of point charges in order to consider electrostatic bulk influence. Surface reduction was modeled by the removal of vanadyl/molybdenyl oxygen. Analysis of the electronic structure in all the clusters was conducted in terms of the Mulliken population analysis, Mayer bond-orders, atomic Fukui function values, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) distribution. The results show that substituting a V atom with Mo leads to a reduction of the adjacent metal atom, practically without changing the electronic properties of the oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the NO adsorption on the reduced surfaces Of V2O5 and V2O5 with Mo defects has been studied. In all cases, adsorption is exothermic; the energetic stabilization is the largest for the V11MoO29 from which the molybdenyl atom was removed. However, the calculated adsorption energies are similar, within ca. 3 kcal/mol (12 kJ/mol). Thus, the effect of the molybdenum presence for energetic stabilization of adsorbed NO is not very distinct. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The dependence of the selectivity on the composition of the gas phase was investigated and it was shown that low precursor concentrations enhance selectivity. X-ray diffraction measurements have shown that the deposited films were composed of a mixture of vanadium oxides; the composition dependent on the deposition temperature. At temperatures up to 150 degrees C films were mostly composed by monoclinic VO2. At higher temperatures other peaks corresponding to various vanadium oxides were also observed. The well-known metal-insulator transition was observed near 70 degrees C for films mostly composed by monoclinic VO2.

Some applications are reviewed, with respect to the versatility of the synthetic procedure. Most of the properties of these new high-technology materials are dependent on their structural and chemical composition as well as on the dynamical properties inside the blends.", "ISSN": "0959-9428", "pub": "JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY", "volume": "6", "authors": ["Judeinstein, P", "Sanchez, C"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1996/JM/jm9960600511", "issue": "4", "pages": "511-525"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/cm00016a006", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860999536/cmatex-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "JUL-AUG 1991", "title": "VANADIUM PENTOXIDE GELS", "abstract": "Vanadium pentoxide gels have been known for more than a century.

Monolayers of vanadium oxide, represented as VO(x), may be formed on the surface of a supporting oxide by impregnation with a suitable vanadium source, followed by calcination, by grafting methods using VOCl3 or a vanadyl alkoxide, by heating mechanical mixtures or by coprecipitation. Information on the chemical structures present when there is less than a monolayer of VO(x) can be obtained from vibrational and electron spectroscopies (Raman, FT-IR, XPS). Temperature-programmed reduction (TRP), XRD, ESR and V-51 NMR provide additional characterisation of the materials. VO(x) monolayers are particularly stable on TiO2 and on Al2O3, but are not readily formed on SiO2, where aggregation to V2O5 occurs. At low vanadium contents, isolated VO4 tetrahedra have been detected, and polymeric octahedral VO6 species at higher loadings: various disordered and 'paracrystalline' V2O5 phases have been seen when more than the monolayer loading is present. Species in the monolayer are effective catalysts for oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, for ammoxidation of aromatics and for selective reduction of nitric oxide by ammonia, but not for oxidation of butadiene to maleic anhydride.", "ISSN": "0166-9834", "pub": "APPLIED CATALYSIS", "volume": "71", "authors": ["BOND, GC", "TAHIR, SF"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016698349185002D", "issue": "1", "pages": "1-31"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/cm970268y", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860999536/cmatex-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 1997", "title": "Sol-gel template synthesis of semiconductor oxide micro- and nanostructures", "abstract": "The template method for synthesizing nanostructures involves the synthesis of the desired material within the pores of a nanoporous membrane or other solid.

Equilibration of sas phase oxygen with vanadium oxides results in the formation of the intrinsic defect structure of V2O5 consisting of oxygen vacancies.

Mechanism of the reduction of V2O5 through crystallographic shear, resulting in the formation of V6O13 or V4O9, is illustrated. It is shown that because of a pronounced anisotropy of V2O5 crystal structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions appears. Two types of crystal planes are exposed. The (0 1 0) basal plane has all chemical bonds almost fully saturated.

Temperature-programmed reduction and pretreatment studies indicated that the passivated VN could be activated by reduction in H-2 at 500 degrees C for 3 h, Lower reduction temperatures or times resulted in suppressed surface areas and O-2 chemisorptive uptakes. Oxygen chemisorption on the fully reduced vanadium nitrides scaled linearly with the surface area.

The vanadium nitrides were highly active butane dehydrogenation catalysts with selectivities in excess of 98%. Volumetric reaction rates for the highest surface area VN were superior to those for a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The average turnover frequency for the VN catalysts was 4.3 x 10(-4) s(-1) at 450 degrees C assuming that oxygen chemisorbed atomically onto the active sites. The corresponding turnover frequency for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was 6.3 x 10(-2) s(-1) suggesting that while selectivities for the VN and Pt-based catalysts were similar, VN had a lower intrinsic activity.

However, V2O5 crystallites have been mainly observed in catalysts with higher V-content, although the presence of isolated V-species on the surface of the metal oxide support cannot be completely ruled out.

Seedlings were planted in 1908 and 1909 at Willard, N.C., which had been produced from crosses made in Texas and Florida between local male vines and standard varieties such as Scuppernong, James and Thomas. The seedlings formed the basis of future breeding work. Selected seedlings were crossed with standard varieties, promising seedlings, local varieties found on field surveys in the South-eastern states, and wild male vines. Selection was carried out on this hybrid material. Two seedlings were obtained from the first group of hybrids, which had perfect flowers and were both cross-fertile and self-fertile; by crossing these two seedlings and seedlings derived from them with standard varieties, new hermaphrodite varieties have been produced. One-of the original seedlings, designated V23 R4 B2, was obtained from a cross of Eden with a wild male vine known as Mission, from Florida. The other seedling, designated V19 R7 B2, occurred in the progeny of a cross between Scuppernong and a wild, white staminate vine at New Smyrna, Fla.  \n\nDescriptions are given of 15 new muscadine grapes which have now been formally introduced. The following varieties are perfect-flowered: Burgaw, Duplin, Fender, Tarheel, Wallace and Willard. \n\nThe dark-fruited variety Burgaw has been produced from the cross Thomas x V19 R7 B2. Except for its perfect flowers, it resembles Thomas in fruit and other characteristics. It is one of the most productive midseason varieties. \n\nThe pedigree of Duplin is Stanford x V10 R15 B4 bisexual (Eden x V23 R4 B2). The variety bears large loose clusters of soft, oval dark fruit, ripening in the midseason. The fruit is not of the highest quality, but has some attractive characters which may be of value to breeders. Fender was derived from the cross Latham x XV20 R36 B4 bisexual [V8O R3 B2 (seed from Denison, Texas) x V19 R7 B2]. It is a highly productive, late maturing white-fruited variety, which is not considered as one of the best varieties available, but primarily as a variety likely to be of interest to collectors of varieties and to breeders. \n\nThe cross Lusta x V68 R14 B4 (Eden x V23 R4 B2) formed the parentage of the midseason variety Tarheel. The variety bears clusters of 8 to 10 small, shining jet-black berries, excellent in flavour. It is recommended for domestic growing, the variety collector and breeder, as one of the best of the black small-fruited varieties that have been developed. \n\nWillard was produced from the cross V47 R9 B2 (white-fruited selection, AF 5130) x V19 R7 B2. It is a productive white-fruited grape, ripening fairly early, which can serve as a pollinator for Scuppernong and other pistillate varieties. Its fruit is not quite as good as that of Scuppernong, but is entirely acceptable to wine manufacturers. \n\nThe pedigree of Wallace is V26 R5 B4 [James x V66 R3 B2 (Eden x native male vine)] x Willard. It is white-fruited, and recommended for planting with pistillate varieties, especially late blooming ones. In itself Wallace is also valuable as a late fruiting variety of good quality. \n\nThe new pistillate varieties described are Cape Fear, Creswell, Kilgore, Morrison, New River, Onslow, Orton, Stanford and Topsail. \n\nCape Fear was bred from the cross Burgaw x V2O R36 B4 bisexual [V8O R3 B2 (seed from Denison, Texas) x V19 R7 B2]. It is a high yielding very late white-fruited variety, recommended for the variety collection, table use, and probably also for breeding purposes. \n\nCreswell originated from a vine found on the farm of F. R. White, Creswell, N.C. It has been tested in connexion with the breeding investigations, and has given such a good performance that a description of it has been included. It is a late ripening, dark-fruited variety, with excellent dessert quality. It is also recommended for wine manufacture. \n\nKilgore was developed from a cross of Labama (San Jacinto x ?. Brilliant) by an unknown male parent. It produces white fruit, tinged with red and somewhat translucent in appearance; the latter characteristic makes the variety suitable for fancy baskets. The pulp is very soft. In maturity Kilgore is a late midseason variety. It may be useful to the breeder. \n\nThe cross Scuppernong x a white fruited native vine (AF 7051) forms the pedigree of Morrison, a variety named many years ago. It is a very early, white variety of the Scuppernong type, but in fruit quality it is better than this variety. It is recommended as a dessert variety, particularly for domestic cultivation. \n\nNew River is a seedling whose origin is given as seed of San Jacinto on p. 8 but as seed of Scuppernong on p. 16. It ripens earlier than the parent variety. It is valuable as an early white-fruited grape for the table. The flavour is not as good as that of Scuppernong. The pedigree of Onslow is V22 R5 B4 [James x V66 R3 B2 (Eden x white-fruited native male AF 7051)] x Burgaw. It is a black-fruited early variety, suitable for dessert and wine making. Orton and Topsail have the same parentage, Latham x Burgaw. Both are white-fruited midseason varieties. Topsail has been rated as better flavoured than Scuppernong, but its appearance is less attractive on account of its greenish colour and the dark patches which occasionally develop on the fruit. The sugar content of the juice is about 2% higher than that of Scuppernong. Orton is almost as satisfactory as Topsail. \n\nStanford, a white-fruited and moderately late maturing variety, was obtained from seed of San Jacinto and named some years ago. Its large sized berries and other characters render it a good commercial variety. \n\nThe breeding programme has also included hybridization of muscadine grape varieties with North American bunch grapes and with European grapes. But such breeding appears to have only limited prospects, on account of the sterility and deficiency in vigour of the seedlings.", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "Circular.

Equilibration of sas phase oxygen with vanadium oxides results in the formation of the intrinsic defect structure of V2O5 consisting of oxygen vacancies. Discussion of the properties of vacancies as deduced from measurements of electrical conductivity, EPR and IR spectra and the stability of different oxygen vacant sites as obtained from quantum-chemical calculations is given. Mechanism of the reduction of V2O5 through crystallographic shear, resulting in the formation of V6O13 or V4O9, is illustrated. It is shown that because of a pronounced anisotropy of V2O5 crystal structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions appears. Two types of crystal planes are exposed. The (0 1 0) basal plane has all chemical bonds almost fully saturated.

In many cases, the rigid-band model (RBM) is a useful first approximation for describing the changes in electronic properties of the host material with intercalation. The applicability of the rigid-band model is taken as a test for the properties most desirable in a good intercalation material. This review paper presents experimental results, namely optical and electrical measurements, obtained on various intercalation materials such as dichalcogenides, trichalcogenides and oxides to probe the validity of the RBM. The impact of the lithium intercalation is discussed for various structural forms, from well-crystallised to amorphous compounds. We observed, nevertheless, that the rigid-band model is not applicable to all of the layered intercalation materials. This needs yet to be more extensively documented for their promising application as insertion electrode in rechargeable lithium batteries. Compounds such as TiS2, TaS2, MoS2, NiPS3, MoO3, V2O5, V6O13, LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4 and LiNiVO4 are tested in this work.

The dominant peaks in the anion total mass distribution correspond to clusters having stoichiometries of the form (VO2)(n)(VO3)(m)(O-2)(q)(-). Collision-induced dissociation studies of the vanadium oxide species V2O4-6-, V3O6-9-, V4O8-10-, V5O11-13-, V6O13-15-, and V7O16-18- indicate that VO2, VO3, and V2O5 units are the main building blocks of these clusters. There are many similarities between the anion mass distribution and that of the cation distribution studied previously. The principal difference is a shift to higher oxygen content by one additional oxygen atom for the stoichiometric anions (VxOy-) as compared to the cations with the same number of vanadium atoms, which is attributed to the extra pair of electrons of the anionic species. The oxygen-rich clusters, VxOy(O-2)(-), are shown to more tightly adsorb molecular oxygen than those of the corresponding cationic clusters. In addition, the bond dissociation thresholds for the vanadium oxide clusters DeltaE(V+-O)=6.09 +/-0.28 eV, DeltaE(OV+-O)=3.51 +/-0.36 eV, and DeltaE(O2V--O)=5.43 +/-0.31 eV are determined from the energy-dependent collision-induced dissociation cross sections with Xe as the collision partner.

Optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction is often difficult.  To determine whether measurement of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during maximal exercise testing can be used to identify patients in whom transplantation can be safely deferred, we prospectively performed exercise testing on all ambulatory patients referred for transplant between October 1986 and December 1989.\n\nMethods and Results.  Patients were assigned into one of three groups on the basis of exercise data:  Group 1 (n = 35) comprised patients accepted for transplant (VO2 less-than-or-equal-to 14 ml/kg/min); group 2 (n = 52) comprised patients considered too well for transplant (VO2 > 14 ml/kg/min); and group 3 (n = 27) comprised patients with low VO2 rejected for transplant due to noncardiac problems.  All three groups were comparable in New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, and cardiac index (p = NS).  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly lower in group 2 than in either group 1 or 3 (p < 0.05), although there was wide overlap.  Patients with preserved exercise capacity (group 2) had cumulative 1- and 2-year survival rates of 94% and 84%, which are equal to survival levels after transplantation.  In contrast, patients rejected for transplant (group 3) had survival rates of only 47% at 1 year and 32% at 2 years, whereas patients awaiting transplantation (group 1) had a survival rate of 70% at 1 year (both p < 0.005 versus patients with VO2 > 14 ml/kg/min).  All deaths in group 2 were sudden.  By univariate and multivariate analyses, peak VO2 was the best predictor of survival, with only pulmonary capillary wedge pressure providing additional prognostic information.\n\nConclusions.  These data suggest that cardiac transplantation can be safely deferred in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and peak exercise VO2 of more than 14 ml/min/kg.", "ISSN": "0009-7322", "pub": "CIRCULATION", "volume": "83", "authors": ["MANCINI, DM", "EISEN, H", "KUSSMAUL, W", "MULL, R", "EDMUNDS, LH", "WILSON, JR"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "3", "pages": "778-786"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1977", "title": "MEASUREMENT OF VO2, VCO2, AND EVAPORATIVE WATER-LOSS WITH A FLOW-THROUGH MASK", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "8750-7587", "pub": "JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY", "volume": "42", "authors": ["WITHERS, PC"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "120-123"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1982", "title": "OXYGEN UTILIZATION AND VENTILATION DURING EXERCISE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CARDIAC-FAILURE", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0009-7322", "pub": "CIRCULATION", "volume": "65", "authors": ["WEBER, KT", "KINASEWITZ, GT", "JANICKI, JS", "FISHMAN, AP"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "6", "pages": "1213-1223"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0022-4596(71)90091-0", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022459671900910/pdf?md5=d5de5097afb1bd02640faf4bbb4f9e23&pid=1-s2.0-0022459671900910-main.pdf", "pubDate": "1971", "title": "2 COMPONENTS OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC TRANSITION IN VO2\n", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0022-4596", "pub": "JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY", "volume": "3", "authors": ["GOODENOU.JB"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022459671900910", "issue": "4", "pages": "490-&"}, {"DOI": "10.1080/02640418808729800", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1988", "title": "The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness", "abstract": "A maximal multistage 20 m shuttle run test was designed to determine the maximal aerobic power of schoolchildren, healthy adults attending fitness class and athletes performing in sports with frequent stops and starts (e.g. basketball, fencing and so on).

This paper reviews the design requirements of SESAM's for stable pulse generation in both the mode-locked and Q-switched regime. The combination of device structure and material parameters for SESAM's provide sufficient design freedom to choose key parameters such as recovery time, saturation intensity, and saturation fluence, in a compact structure with low insertion loss. We have been able to demonstrate, for example, passive modelocking (with no Q-switching) using an intracavity saturable absorber in solid-state lasers with long upper state lifetimes (e.g., 1-mu m neodymium transitions), Kerr lens modelocking assisted with pulsewidths as short as 6.5 fs from a Ti:sapphire laser--the shortest pulses ever produced directly out of a laser without any external pulse compression, and passive Q-switching with pulses as short as 56 ps--the shortest pulses ever produced directly from a Q-switched solid-state laser. Diode-pumping of such lasers is leading to practical, real-world ultrafast sources, and we will review results on diode-pumped Cr:LiSAF, Nd:glass, Yb:YAG, Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, Nd:LSB, and Nd:YVO4.", "ISSN": "1077-260X", "pub": "IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS", "volume": "2", "authors": ["Keller, U", "Weingarten, KJ", "Kartner, FX", "Kopf, D", "Braun, B", "Jung, ID", "Fluck, R", "Honninger, C", "Matuschek, N", "derAu, JA"], "DOIlink": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=571743", "issue": "3", "pages": "435-453"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/cm011663y", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860999536/cmatex-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 2002", "title": "Fabrication, patterning, and optical properties of nanocrystalline YVO4 : A (A = Eu3+, Dy3+, Sm3+, Er3+) phosphor films via sol-gel soft lithography", "abstract": "Nanocrystalline YVO4:A (A = Eu3+, Dy3+, Sm3+, Er3+) phosphor films and their patterning were fabricated by a Pechini sol-gel process combined with soft lithography.

For each case we derive the magnetic exchange constants, which determine the spin wave dispersions, as well as the partial optical sum rules. The magnetic and optical properties of early transition metal oxides with degenerate t(2g) orbitals (titanates and vanadates with perovskite structure) are shown to depend only on two parameters, viz. the superexchange energy J and the ratio eta of Hund's exchange to the intraorbital Coulomb interaction, and on the actual orbital state.

In some cases orbital fluctuations are quenched and decoupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom with static orbital order gives satisfactory results for the optical weights.

The electronic and magnetic properties are correlated to the structural parameters. Ten-fold degenerate D-2 term of 3d(1) V4+-ions is split into five Kramers doublets with overall CF splitting Delta(1) approximate to 2 eV and the total splitting of the T-2(2g) state Delta(o) approximate to 0.4 eV under combined actions of octahedral CF, trigonal (D-3d) distortion at V-site and spin-orbit coupling. The ground doublet is a well-isolated effectively spin s=1/2 state, characterized by the anisotropic g-tensors and directional magnetic moments. The degeneracy of the ground state is lifted by the spin-spin correlations among V-4-tetrahedra at T similar to 170 K, which causes the formation of ferromagnetic clusters in these pyrochlores. The temperature dependence of the calculated directional site-susceptibilities shows that the V4+ ions have a substantial easy-axis single-ion anisotropy along local < 111 > axis of a given V-4-tetrahedron in the magnetic phase where ferromagnetic clusters coexist with paramagnetic phase.

When the pH value was lower than 3.5, only irregular nanoparticles of m-LaVO(4):Ln were obtained. Increasing the pH value can induce the polymorph transformation from monazite to zircon type. As the pH value ranged from 4.5 to 6.0, uniform t-LaVO(4):Ln nanorods with a diameter of 15 nm and length of about 100 nm were obtained. When the pH value was further increased to higher than 6.0, the as-obtained t-LaVO(4):Ln nanocrystals exhibited particle-like morphology, with an average diameter of about 20 nm. The possible mechanism responsible for the phase control and dnisotropic morphology evolution of the LaVO(4):Ln nanocrystals was discussed. Their luminescent properties were studied and compared. The results indicated that the challenging transformation from monazite to the metastable zircon structure for LaVO(4):Ln resulted in a remarkable improvement of the luminescent properties. This improvement was rationally analyzed, and the impact of the structure and shape on luminescent properties was explored. It suggests that we could obtain the function-improved materials by tailoring the structure and shape of the lanthanide-doped LaVO(4) nanostructures.", "ISSN": "1528-7483", "pub": "CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN", "volume": "7", "authors": ["Fan, WL", "Bu, YX", "Song, XY", "Sun, SX", "Zhao, XA"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cg060807o", "issue": "11", "pages": "2361-2366"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0040-6090(03)01130-1", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609003011301/pdfft?md5=91a9eb9ebb600943cf5da2bcc9c43a2b&pid=1-s2.0-S0040609003011301-main.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 1 2003", "title": "Luminescence properties of RP1-xVxO4: A (R=Y, Gd, La; A=Sm3+Er3+ x=0, 0.5, 1) thin films prepared by pechini sol-gel process", "abstract": "Thin film phosphors with compositions of RP1-xVxO4: A (R = Y, Gd, La; A = Sm3+, Et3+; x = 0, 0.5, 1) have been prepared by a Pechini sol-gel process.

Conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone/cyclohexene was investigated as a model reaction to assess the acid-base properties of these materials. The catalytic property was evaluated for a single step synthesis of 2,6-dimethylphenol from cyclohexanone and methanol in the vapor phase at normal atmospheric pressure. Characterization results suggest that the co-precipitated La2O3-TiO2 when calcined at 773 K is in X-ray amorphous state and exhibits reasonably high specific surface area.

The La2O3-TiO2 also accommodates a monolayer equivalent of V2O5 (12 wt.%) in a highly dispersed state on its surface. The V2O5/La2O3-TiO2 catalyst is thermally quite stable up to 873 K calcination temperature. When subjected to thermal treatments beyond 873 K, the dispersed vanadium oxide selectively interacts with La2O3 portion of the mixed oxide and forms a LaVO4 compound.

The different photoluminescent properties of Eu(3+) doped m- and t-LaVO(4) are demonstrated. A dissolution-precipitation mechanism is mainly responsible for the anisotropic morphology and phase control evolution of the LaVO(4) nanocrystals.

The M2O3-TiO2 and V2O5/M2O3-TiO2 (M = Ga, In and La) samples were subjected to thermal treatments from 773 to 1073 K and were investigated by X-ray diffraction, FT-infrared, and BET surface area methods to establish the effects of vanadia loading and thermal treatments on the surface structure of the dispersed vanadium oxide species and temperature stability of these catalysts. Characterization results suggest that the co-precipitated M2O3-TiO2 Composite oxides are in X-ray amorphous state and exhibit reasonably high specific surface area at 773 K calcination. The M2O3-TiO2 mixed oxide supports also accommodate a monolayer equivalent Of V2O5 (12 wt.%) in a highly dispersed state. The V2O5/M2O3-TiO2 catalysts are thermally stable up to 873-973 K calcination temperature. When subjected to thermal treatments beyond 873-973 K, the dispersed vanadium oxide selectively interacts with In2O3 or La2O3 portions of the respective mixed oxides and forms InVO4 Or LaVO4 compounds. The remaining TiO2 appears in the form of anatase or rutile phase. In the case Of V2O5/Ga2O3-TiO2 sample, no such surface vanadate compound formation was observed. All samples were evaluated for one step synthesis of 2,6-dimethylphenol from cyclohexanone and methanol mixtures in the vapour phase at normal atmospheric pressure. The 12% V2O5/La2O3-TiO2 catalyst exhibited good conversion and product selectivity among various samples investigated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

First, we derive parameters of the effective Hubbard-type Hamiltonian for the isolated t(2g) bands using newly developed downfolding method for the kinetic-energy part and a hybrid approach, based on the combination of the random-phase approximation and the constraint local-density approximation, for the screened Coulomb interaction part. Apart from the above-mentioned approximation, the procedure of constructing the model Hamiltonian is totally parameter free. The results are discussed in terms of the Wannier functions localized around transition-metal sites. The obtained Hamiltonian was solved using a number of techniques, including the mean-field Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, the second-order perturbation theory for the correlation energy, and a variational superexchange theory, which takes into account the multiplet structure of the atomic states. We argue that the crystal distortion has a profound effect not only on the values of the crystal-field (CF) splitting, but also on the behavior of transfer integrals and even the screened Coulomb interactions. Even though the CF splitting is not particularly large to fully quench the orbital degrees of freedom (ODF), the crystal distortion imposes a severe constraint on the form of the possible orbital states, which favor the formation of the experimentally observed magnetic structures in YTiO3, YVO3, and LaVO3 even at the level of mean-field HF approximation. Particularly, LaVO3 presents an interesting example of the system where the ODF are well quenched only in one of the monoclinic planes and remain relatively flexible in the second plane, leaving some room for the orbital fluctuations. It is also remarkable that for all three compounds, the main results of all-electron calculations can be successfully reproduced in our minimal model derived for the isolated t(2g) bands. We confirm that such an agreement is possible only when the nonsphericity of the Madelung potential is explicitly included into the model.

These phase transitions are confirmed by specific heat measurements. The phase transition at T-t in LaVO3 or T-0 in CeVO3 is due to a G-type orbital ordering which lowers the structure symmetry from orthorhombic Pbnm to monoclinic P2(1)/b11. The structure change at T-N in CeVO3 is ascribed to an orbital ordering enhanced magnetostrictive distortion, while that at T-N in LaVO3 is most probably due to an ordered occupation of the vanadium 3d t(2g) orbitals associated with an antiferromagnetic ordering.

In this Rapid Communication, the magnetic properties of LaVO3/SrVO3 superlattices, in which the geometrically confined doping is produced by a one monolayer thick SrVO3 film, are presented. In contrast to the solid solution La1-xSrxVO3, such superlattices have a finite magnetization up to room temperature. Furthermore, the total magnetization of the superlattice depends on the thickness of the LaVO3 layer, indicating an indirect coupling of the magnetization that emerges at adjacent dopant layers.

The results show that there exist two complex sequences of magnetic transitions with the characteristics of magnetization reversal and Yb3+/Cr3+ spin ordering at different temperature, respectively. The antiferromagneticlike transition around T-N=118 K is attributed to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the Cr3+ spins and a negative magnetization, accompanied with a tendency to the plateau below 10 K caused by the Yb3+ ordering. We obtain the Weiss constant of -197.0 K and an effective moment of 5.99 mu(B) for the sum of the free ion values of 4.53 mu(B) for Yb3+ and 3.87 mu(B) for high-spin Cr3+ from the experiments, which shows an antiferromagnetic interaction and the existence of weak canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) characteristics. Corresponding to the magnetic phase transition in the Cr sublattice, the specific heat capacity under zero fields exhibits a sharp lambda-shape peak near temperature T-N, which is depressed and broadened smoothly with the increase in the magnetic field. And a shoulder-shaped Schottky-type anomaly below 12 K is observed in the specific heat capacity curves. This can be interpreted by accounting for the molecular field approximation by assuming that the induced polarization of the paramagnetic ytterbium ions is opposite to the ferromagnetic moment of the chromium ions. According to the results of the zero fields cooling and the field cooling magnetization, the possible existence of spin ordering for the Yb3+ moments can be predicted.

The physical complexity of this class of compounds, manifested by the largely varying electronic characters (band/Mott-Hubbard/charge-transfer insulators and metals), magnetic orderings, structural distortions (cooperative Jahn-Teller-type instabilities), as well as by the strong competition between localization/delocalization effects associated with the gradual filling of the t(2g) and e(g) orbitals, symbolize a critical and challenging case for theory. Our results indicate that HSE is able to provide a consistent picture of the complex physical scenario encountered across the LaMO3 series and significantly improve the standard DFT description. The only exceptions are the correlated paramagnetic metals LaNiO3 and LaCuO3, which are found to be treated better within DFT. By fitting the ground-state properties with respect to alpha, we have constructed a set of \"optimum\" values of alpha from LaScO3 to LaCuO3: it is found that the optimum mixing parameter decreases with increasing filling of the d manifold (LaScO3: 0.25; LaTiO3 and LaVO3: 0.10-0.15; LaCrO3, LaMnO3, and LaFeO3: 0.15; LaCoO3: 0.05; LaNiO3 and LaCuO3: 0).

These glasses were prepared by a normal quench technique and the actual compositions of the glasses were determined by ICP spectroscopy. XRD patterns confirm the amorphous nature of the present glasses. The temperature dependence of DC electrical conductivity of these glasses has been studied in terms of different hopping models. The IR results agree with previous investigations on similar glasses and it has been concluded that similar to SrO-vanadate glasses, metavandate chainlike structures of SrV2O6 and individual VO4 units also occur in these SrO-borovanadate glasses. The SrV2O6 and VOn polyhedra predominate in the low B2O3 containing SrO-borovanadate glasses as the B substitutes into the V sites of the various VOn polyhedra and only when the B2O3 concentration exceeds the SrO content do BOn structures appear. This qualitative picture of three distinct structural groupings for the Sr-vanadate and Sr-borovanadate glasses is consistent with the proposed glass structure on previous IR and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies on these types of glasses. The conductivity results were analyzed with reference to theoretical models existing in the literature and the analysis shows that the conductivity data are consistent with Mott's nearest neighbor hopping model. However, both Mott VRH and Greaves models are suitable to explain the data. Schnakenberg's generalized polaron hopping model is also consistent with the temperature dependence of the activation energy, but the various model parameters such as density of states, hopping energy obtained from the best fits were found to be not in accordance with the prediction of the Mott model.", "ISSN": "0217-9792", "pub": "INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B", "volume": "24", "authors": ["Mekki, A", "Khattak, GD", "Siddiqui, MN"], "DOIlink": "http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217979210053033", "issue": "11", "pages": "1471-1488"}, {"DOI": "10.1088/1674-0068/20/06/727-732", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/cps/journal/cjcp/20/6/1.4798187.pdf;jsessionid=1dd7t8lm19fa.x-aip-live-06?itemId=/content/cps/journal/cjcp/20/6/10.1088/1674-0068/20/06/727-732&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/cps/journal/cjcp", "pubDate": "DEC 2007", "title": "Fabrication and characterization of micro-pattern dandelion-like and nanobelts of beta-SrV2O6 via hydeothermal process", "abstract": "Dandelion-like micro-crystallites and long belt-like nanostructures of Sr-V-O materials were synthesized under mild hydrothermal reaction conditions in the presence of mineralizer adipic acid at 220 degrees C for 60 h and 180 degrees C for 60 h, respectively.

The oxidized system contains the crystal phases LaVO4, Sr2V2O7 and Sr3V2O8 which originate from the crystal phases LaVO3 and SrVO3 existing in the reduced system. The oxidized solids exhibits surface areas (BET) around 8-10 m(2) g(-1) while the reduced ones much lower similar to 1 m(2) g(-1). SEM studies showed that the oxidized particles exhibits a much more irregular surface with pores, cracks, steps and similar features which lack in the reduced solids. The oxidized solids rich in Sr show also a platelet-like structure. The acid/base function of the surface was studied using the isopropanol decomposition as a test reaction towards propene or acetone. The oxidized forms of the solids exhibits stronger acidic properties as compared to the reduced one and lead to dehydration towards propene while the reduced solids exhibit also considerable dehydrogenation activity. The rest features of catalytic action, like reaction rate and apparent activation energies appear rather similar and a common compensation effect, for the reduced and oxidized solids, is observed. The variation of the reaction path towards dehydrogenation or dehydration is related to the intermediate electronegativity of the solids for both the reduced and the oxidized samples.

Study of microstructure of gold-coated pellet by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows well-defined and homogeneous grains in the morphology. Detailed studies of dielectric parameters (epsilon(r) and tan delta) of the compound as a function of temperature at some selected frequencies reveal their independence for a wide range of temperatures. An anomaly in relative permittivity (epsilon(r)) suggests the existence of a ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of diffuse-type in the material that confirms through the detailed studies of its electric polarization. Detailed studies of impedance and related parameters exhibit that the electrical properties of the material are strongly dependent on temperature, and bear a good correlation with its microstructure (i.e., bulk, grain boundary, etc.). The decrease in value of bulk resistance on increasing temperature suggests the negative temperature co-efficient of resistance (NTCR) behavior of the material. Studies of electric modulus indicate the presence of hopping conduction mechanism in the system with non-exponential type of conductivity relaxation. The nature of variation of dc conductivity with temperature confirms the Arrhenius and NTCR type of behavior in the material.

The superconducting properties of the critical current density, J(c) and a. c. losses of the tapes strongly depend on the purity of SVO, especially on the residue of SrCO3 in it. In order to examine the behavior of an SVO barrier in detail, we prepared pellet samples with seven layers, which were stacked by barrier and Bi2223 layers one after the other, and examined the reaction between them. The five kinds of barrier layers, such as SrCO3, Sr6V2O11 (6-2SVO), 5 and 10 mass% V2O5-added 6-2SVO, and Sr3V2O8 (3-2SVO), were used. The pellet samples were heat-treated at 1113 K for 72-360 ks in air. In the barriers of SrCO3 and 6-2SVO, including the residue of SrCO3, the large Bi2212 (Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2Ox) grains are grown perpendicular to the interface to form the Bi2212 layers with a thickness of about 100 mum by the reaction between the barrier and Bi oxide. The majority of the Bi-oxide layers are composed of Bi2223 fine grains parallel to the interface. The thickness of the formed Bi2212 layers decreases when the content of SrCO3 in the barriers is decreased. In the reaction, SrCO3 reacts with the Bi oxides, and the elements of Pb and Cu diffuse and distribute homogeneously in the barrier layers. The residue of SrCO3 in 6-2SVO decreases obviously when the additional content of V2O5 is increased. In the 6-2SVO barriers with 5 and 10 mass% added-V2O5, only the very fine Pb oxide grains of (Sr, Ca) 2PbO4 are precipitated in a row along the interface. No precipitation occurs for the 3-2SVO barrier. The 6-2SVO is stable, and the 3-2SVO is transformed into the 6-2SVO phase during the heat treatment. We can conclude that, for the use of 6-2SVO as a barrier, it is very important to remove the residue of SrCO3 in the 6-2SVO to prevent the formation of Bi2212 layers and, for that purpose, a small addition of V2O5 is effective.", "ISSN": "0021-4876", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF METALS", "volume": "65", "authors": ["Fukayama, T", "Inaba, T", "Sato, M", "Maeda, H"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "10", "pages": "941-945"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/s11664-014-3476-8", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11664-014-3476-8.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 2015", "title": "Pyroelectric Response and Conduction Mechanism in Highly Crystallized Ferroelectric Sr-3(VO4)(2) Ceramic", "abstract": "We present a study on the ferroelectric phase transition, pyroelectric properties, and conduction mechanism of highly crystallized strontium orthovanadate (Sr3V2O8) ceramic, prepared by a solid-state reaction technique.

By defining a low-energy Hubbard Hamiltonian in the basis of Wannier functions for the t(2g) LDA band and solving it in the single-site dynamical mean-field (DMFT) approximation, it was recently shown (Pavarini et al (2004) Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 176403) that simultaneously with the Mott transition there occurs a strong suppression of orbital fluctuations due to splitting of the t(2g) levels. The present paper reviews and expands this work, in particular in the direction of exposing the underlying chemical mechanisms by means of ab initio LDA Wannier functions generated with the Nth order muffin-tin orbital (NMTO) method. The Wannier functions for the occupied oxygen-p band illustrate the importance of oxygen-p to large cation-d covalency for the progressive GdFeO3-type distortion along the series. The oxygen-porbitals which pd sigma-bond to the cations are the same as those which pd pi-bond to the transition-metal t(2g) orbitals. As a consequence, the Wannier functions for the t(2g) band exhibit residual covalency between the transition-metal t(2g), the large cation-d, and the oxygen-p states. This residual covalency, which increases along the series, turns out to be responsible not only for the splittings, Delta, of the t(2g) levels, but also for non-cubic perturbations of the hopping integrals, both of which are decisive for the Mott transition. We find good agreement with the optical and photoemission spectra for all four materials, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital polarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization volume (pressure) for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted and the role of the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion is discussed. For use in future many-body calculations, we tabulate the t(2g) on-site and hopping matrix elements for all four materials and give an analytical expression for the orthorhombic Hamiltonian in the k + Q representation. Using conventional super-exchange theory, our on-site and hopping matrix elements reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and YTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 where, without the JT distortion, the magnetic orderwould be antiferromagnetic C- or A-type, rather than ferromagnetic. It is decisive that upon increasing the GdFeO3-type distortion, the nearest-neighbour hopping between the lowest and the upper-level Wannier functions becomes stronger than the hopping between the lowest-level Wannier functions. Finally, we show that the non-cubic perturbations responsible for this behaviour make it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t(2g) LDA bandstructure to a pseudo-cubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated from the two others by a direct gap and has a width, W-I, which is significantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t(2g) band. The progressive GdFeO3-type distortion thus favours electron localization by decreasing W, by increasing Delta/W, and by decreasing W-I/W. Our conclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with those of Mochizuki and Imada (2003 Phys. Rev.

The method is illustrated for the series of transition-metal (TM) oxides: SrVO3, YTiO3, V2O3, and Y2Mo2O7, whose low-energy properties are linked exclusively to the electronic structure of an isolated t(2g) band. The method consists of three parts, starting from the electronic structure in the local-density approximation (LDA). (i) Construction of the kinetic-energy Hamiltonian using formal downfolding method. It allows us to describe the band structure close to the Fermi level in terms of a limited number of (unknown yet) Wannier functions (WFs), and eliminate the rest of the basis states. (ii) Solution of an inverse problem and construction of WFs for the given kinetic-energy Hamiltonian. Here, we closely follow the construction of the basis functions in the liner-muffin-tin-orbital (LMTO) method, and enforce the orthogonality of WFs to other bands. In this approach, one can easily control the contributions of the kinetic-energy term to the WFs. (iii) Calculation of screened Coulomb interactions in the basis of auxiliary WFs. The latter are defined as the WFs for which the kinetic-energy term is set to be zero. Meanwhile, the hybridization between TM d and other atomic states is preserved by the orthogonality condition to other bands. The use of auxiliary WFs is necessary in order to avoid the double counting of the kinetic-energy term, which is included explicitly in the model Hamiltonian. In order to calculate the screened Coulomb interactions we employed a hybrid approach. First, we evaluate the screening caused by the change of occupation numbers and the relaxation of the LMTO basis functions, using the conventional constraint-LDA approach, where all matrix elements of hybridization connecting the TM d orbitals and other orbitals are set to be zero. Then, we switch on the hybridization and evaluate the screening of on-site Coulomb interactions associated with the change of this hybridization in the random-phase approximation. The second channel of screening appears to be very important, and results in relatively small values of effective Coulomb interactions in the t(2g) band (of the order of 2-3 eV, depending on the material). We discuss details of this screening and consider its band-filling dependence, frequency dependence, influence of the lattice distortion, proximity of other bands, as well as the effect of dimensionality of the model Hamiltonian.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "73", "authors": ["Solovyev, IV"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.155117", "issue": "15", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/0378-7753(94)02110-O", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037877539402110O/pdf?md5=bd72da699f4a8cbfe397df71d92b9a41&pid=1-s2.0-037877539402110O-main.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 1995", "title": "OXIDE CATHODE WITH PEROVSKITE STRUCTURE FOR RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES", "abstract": "Lithium ions were electrochemically inserted into perovskite-type oxides SrVO3-delta and La0.50Li0.37TiO2.94 using galvanic cell: Li\\1 M LiClO4 in PC\\SrVO3-delta or La0.50Li0.37TiO2.94.

We propose a Green's function ansatz for the Anderson impurity problem with retarded interactions, in which the Green's function factorizes into a contribution stemming from an effective static-U problem and a bosonic high-energy part introducing collective plasmon excitations. Our approach relies on the scale separation of the low-energy properties, related to the instantaneous static U, from the intermediate-to high-energy features originating from the retarded part of the interaction. We argue that for correlated materials where retarded interactions arise from downfolding higher-energy degrees of freedom, the characteristic frequencies are typically in the antiadiabatic regime. In this case, accurate approximations to the bosonic factor are relatively easy to construct, with the most simple being the boson factor of the dynamical atomic-limit problem. We benchmark the quality of our method against numerically exact continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo results for the Anderson-Holstein model both at half-and quarter-filling. Furthermore, we study the Mott transition within the Hubbard-Holstein model within extended dynamical mean field theory.

The catalytic transformation of IPA over these solids shows that the products obtained are propene and acetone. The selectivity of the reaction for x=0.0 is ca. 15% for acetone (85% propene) and increases linearly with the substitution of La by Sr reaching at x=1.0 the value of 40% (60% propene). The total reaction rate was maximum at x=0.0 and drops up to x=0.2, thereafter remaining almost steady. The apparent activation energies calculated for the total conversion of IPA (E(tot)) according to the first order kinetics are clustered around 120 kJ/mol.

This enhancement of eta in the M2V2O7 could be due to following structural features: the stronger V-V and weaker V-M correlations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we demonstrate a novel type of single-component white-light Sr2-xV2-O-7:Eu-x phosphor with dual-luminescence centers (x = 0-0.24) for white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Due to the charge transfer absorption (V5+O42- -> V4+O42-), the white light spectra they emit consist of both a broad photoluminescence band centered at about 518 nm, which would be from VO4 groups with approximate C-3v symmetry, and a sharp characteristic spectrum (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) at about 611 nm from the doped Eu3+ ion at the Sr2+ sites in the Sr2V2O7 crystal. Moreover, to explain the broad emission spectra of these phosphors, a 10 x 10 energy matrix was successfully established based on an effective operator Hamiltonian, including free ion and crystal field interactions. For the first time, the broad emission spectra for VO4 groups with the approximate C-3v symmetry were calculated using a complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method. The fitting and experimental values are close to each other, powerfully demonstrating the nature of this broad emission and the feasibility of using the complete diagonalization method to study the phosphors for white LEDs.

The oxidized solids exhibits surface areas (BET) around 8-10 m(2) g(-1) while the reduced ones much lower similar to 1 m(2) g(-1). SEM studies showed that the oxidized particles exhibits a much more irregular surface with pores, cracks, steps and similar features which lack in the reduced solids. The oxidized solids rich in Sr show also a platelet-like structure. The acid/base function of the surface was studied using the isopropanol decomposition as a test reaction towards propene or acetone. The oxidized forms of the solids exhibits stronger acidic properties as compared to the reduced one and lead to dehydration towards propene while the reduced solids exhibit also considerable dehydrogenation activity. The rest features of catalytic action, like reaction rate and apparent activation energies appear rather similar and a common compensation effect, for the reduced and oxidized solids, is observed. The variation of the reaction path towards dehydrogenation or dehydration is related to the intermediate electronegativity of the solids for both the reduced and the oxidized samples.

The compressibility data could be fitted with a Murnaghan equation of state with the zero-pressure bulk modulus B-0 = 161 (7) GPa and the unit-cell volume at ambient pressure = 387.1(3) angstrom(3) (B' = 4.00). A phase transition involving a symmetry reduction from P6(3)/mmc to P6(3)mc can be reliably detected in the high-pressure data. The estimated transition pressure lies in the range 1.18 < P-c < 3.09 GPa. The transition leads to a breaking of the regular Kagome net formed by part of the V ions. While in the ambient pressure structure all V-V distances in the Kagome net are equal, they split into inter-trimer and intratrimer distances in the high-pressure phase. In general, these changes are comparable to those observed in the corresponding low-temperature transition. However, the pressure-induced transition takes place at a lower unit-cell volume compared with the temperature-induced transition. Furthermore, overall trends for inter-trimer and intra-trimer V-V distances as a function of the unit-cell volume are clearly different for datapoints obtained by variation of pressure and temperature. The behavior of BaV6O11 is compared with that of NaV6O11.

[V(1)O-6]-octahedra share common edges and form a Kagome lattice normal to the hexagonal [0 0 1] direction. The layers are connected in the direction of e via trigonal [V(3)O-5]-bipyramids and [V(2)O-6]-octahedra, which share common faces. The Ba-atoms are incorporated into cavities of the vanadium oxide framework and are coordinated by 12 oxygen atoms in the shape of a dodecahedron.\n\nThree magnetic anomalies at approximately 250, 115 and 75K were detected in this compound. All of them are accompanied by anomalies in the specific heat measurement. To characterize possible structural transitions and determine the response of the structure to the magnetic anomalies, single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out in the temperature range from 293 to 80 K. At 250 K the compound undergoes a structural phase transition. The space group above the transition temperature is P6(3)/mmc, at lower temperature the symmetry reduces to P6(3)mc. For the refinements in P6(3)mc an inversion twin model was used, this way accounting for the loss of the center of symmetry. The structural phase transition is characterized by a small displacement of the V(1)-atom (forming the Kagome lattice) out of its central position in the octahedra. As a consequence part of the octahedral edges/angles are increased, while the opposite ones are decreased. One limiting surface of the octahedral sheet is corrugated, while the other one is smoothened with respect to the high-temperature structure. This deformation of the octahedral sheets leads to the corresponding geometrical changes in the other coordination polyhedra.\n\nThe structural response to the magnetic anomaly at 115 K is weak and mainly observable in the geometric parameters concerning the [V(1)O-6]-octahedra and [V(3)O-5]-bipyramids. This may serve as a first indication that the corresponding central atoms play an important role in the mechanism of the magnetic phase transition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These compounds crystallize in Cmca and the structure can be described as a hexagonal close packing of alternating AO(7) and O-8 layers with the B ions occupying 5/8 of the octahedral sites. The presence of A(2+) ions in the close packed AO(7) layers directs the pattern of B-site occupation and octahedral sites near the A(2+) ions are forbidden. The resulting B sublattice consists of B-10 clusters of edge-sharing, distorted tetrahedra connected by corner-sharing to adjacent clusters to form a three-dimensional network, SrV10O15 shows a sharp susceptibility maximum at 50 K and powder neutron diffraction provides evidence for long range magnetic order. In contrast, BaCr10O15 shows only a broad susceptibility maximum at 25 g but a field-cooled-zero-field cooled divergence at 30 K, i.e., spin glass-like behavior. Neutron diffraction detects only short range (SRO) antiferromagnetic (AF) order in the form of diffuse scattering consistent with a correlation length corresponding to the distance between nearest neighbors. The AFSRO sets in below 180 g and surprisingly, ferromagnetic SRO appears below 8 K. The properties of Ba Cr10O15 and BaCr10O15+x are compared to Cr2O3 which is also based on an hcp lattice with nearly the same octahedral site occupation rate, 2/3 versus 5/8, and which shows no evidence of frustration.

BaVO2.9 has been obtained by room temperature oxidation of BaVO2.8 in air and BaVO3.0 obtained by annealing BaVO2.8 or BaVO2.9 at 200-degrees-C in air. The structures of this series of novel compounds have been refined by the Rietveld method using neutron and X-ray diffraction data. Magnetic and electrical properties were examined down to 5 K. All three compounds crystallize in the hexagonal system, space group P3m1BAR and Z = 5. Lattice parameters (angstrom) derived from Si-calibrated Guinier X-ray diffraction data are: BaVO2.8, a = 5.7800(2), c = 11.8969(6); BaVO2.9, a = 5.7215(5), c = 11.685(2); and BaVO3.0, a = 5.6650(3), c = 11.4629(6). The BaVO2.8 Structure consists of face-sharing VO68- and VO69- octahedra that form V3O1214- trimers and of VO44- tetrahedra that share comers with the trimers. The BaVO2.9 and BaVO3.0 structures are similar to BaVO2.8, except that the VO44- tetrahedra in the latter are replaced by VO6 octahedra in the former compounds. The previously reported 24R BaBV7O22 is found to be an intergrowth product of 5H BaVO2.8 (Ba5V5O14) and 9R Ba3V2O8. The hydrogen reduction mechanism of Ba2V2O7 is examined and the initial formation of Ba3V2O8 in the temperature range 650 to 1200-degrees-C has been proven by neutron diffraction. The low stability of BaVO2.8 is analyzed in terms of stress relief of the face-sharing octahedra and the mobility of the unshared tetrahedron comer oxygens. The electrical conductivity increases dramatically with increasing oxygen content in the BaVO3-x series (x = 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0). BaVO2.8 and BaVO2.9 are semiconductors with room temperature resistivities of about 30 and 0. 14 OMEGA . cm, respectively. BaVO3.0 is metallic with a room temperature resistivity of 0.013 OMEGA . cm. The magnetic susceptibility of BaVO2.8 shows a broad maximum at about 20 K, indicative of short range order. The susceptibility of BaVO2.9 has both temperature-independent and Curie-Weiss type paramagnetic contributions, and BaVO3.0 primarily exhibits Pauli paramagnetism.

The renormalization of the kinetic energy is determined from the GW method. By these downfolding procedures, an effective Hamiltonian at low energies is derived. Applying the path integral renormalization group method to this Hamiltonian, we obtain ground-state properties such as the magnetic and orbital orders. Obtained results are consistent with available experimental data. We find that Sr2VO4 is close to the metal-insulator transition. Furthermore, because of the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromgnetic exchange interactions in this system, an antiferromagnetic and orbital-ordered state with a nontrivial and large unit cell structure is predicted in the ground state.

The catalytic transformation of IPA over these solids shows that the products obtained are propene and acetone. The selectivity of the reaction for x=0.0 is ca. 15% for acetone (85% propene) and increases linearly with the substitution of La by Sr reaching at x=1.0 the value of 40% (60% propene).

Pb2V3O9 crystals could only be obtained by the electrochemical reduction of molten PbV2O6. These crystals were always twinned. The previously reported crystal structure of Sr2V3O9 was confirmed.

The nonstandard unit cell was chosen for comparison with the monoclinic structure of Sr2V3O9 With which it is nearly isostructural. The 6s(2) electrons of Pb2+ cause the lowering of the symmetry and distort the cooperative arrangement of the vanadyl bonds existing in the V-O framework of Sr2V3O9 One of the two crystallographically independent Pb2+ is in a distorted, capped, octahedral, environment formed by seven oxygen atoms with Pb-O bonds ranging from 1.426(8) Angstrom to 2.830(8) Angstrom. The other Pb2+ is surrounded by nine oxygen atoms that form a distorted, tricapped, trigonal prism with Pb-O ranging from 2.421(11) to 2.920(8). The lone-pair 6s(2) electrons were located and are about 0.58 Angstrom from the nucleus. Of the four crystallographically independent vanadium atoms, two are in tetrahedral coordination with a mean oxidation number +5. The other two are in octahedral coordination with oxidation number +4. The octahedra link by corner sharing into an infinite chain parallel to [101]. The tetrahedra share corners with the octahedra to form two-dimensional sheets that are then joined by the Pb ions into a three-dimensional structure. One octahedral V4+ cation shows displacement from its polyhedral center toward an oxygen that is corner-shared in the octahedral chain, giving rise to a short vanadyl bond, 1.67(4) Angstrom, and a long bond of 2.18(4) Angstrom, The main difference between the lead and strontium vanadate framework is in the displacement of the second V4+ ion toward an oxygen that is corner-shared with a tetrahedron. sere the short bond length is 1.72(8) Angstrom while it is 2.21(7) Angstrom to the opposite apex. Thus, the cooperative displacement of the V=O bond in the Sr2V3O9 chains is broken by the triclinic transformation, leading to a more disordered V4+ arrangement.

The structures of this series of novel compounds have been refined by the Rietveld method using neutron and X-ray diffraction data. Magnetic and electrical properties were examined down to 5 K. All three compounds crystallize in the hexagonal system, space group P3m1BAR and Z = 5.

The hydrogen reduction mechanism of Ba2V2O7 is examined and the initial formation of Ba3V2O8 in the temperature range 650 to 1200-degrees-C has been proven by neutron diffraction. The low stability of BaVO2.8 is analyzed in terms of stress relief of the face-sharing octahedra and the mobility of the unshared tetrahedron comer oxygens. The electrical conductivity increases dramatically with increasing oxygen content in the BaVO3-x series (x = 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0).

The V4+ ions are arranged in a coupled Majumdar-Ghosh chainlike network. A Curie-Weiss fit of our magnetic susceptibility.(T) data in the temperature region of 80-300 K yields a Curie constant C = 0.39 cm(3)K/mole V4+ and an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature theta = -26 K. The chi(T) curve shows a broad maximum at T similar or equal to 25 K indicative of short-range order (SRO) and an anomaly corresponding to long-range order (LRO) at T-N similar to 6K. The value of the \"frustration parameter\" (f = vertical bar theta/T-N vertical bar similar to 5) suggests that the system is moderately frustrated. Above the LRO temperature, the experimental magnetic susceptibility data match well with the coupled Majumdar-Ghosh (or J(nn) -J(nnn) Heisenberg) chain model with the ratio of the nnn (next-nearest neighbor) to nn (nearest neighbor) magnetic coupling alpha = 2 and J(nnn)/k(B) = 40 K. In a mean-field approach when considering the interchain interactions, we obtain the total interchain coupling to be about 16 K. The LRO anomaly at T-N is also observed in the specific heat CP(T) data and is not sensitive to an applied magnetic field up to 90 kOe. A 51V NMR signal corresponding to the nonmagnetic vanadium was observed. Anomalies at 6 K were observed in the variation with temperature of the 51V NMR linewidth and the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T-1 indicating that they are sensitive to the LRO onset and fluctuations at themagnetic V sites. The existence of two components (one short and another long) is observed in the spin-spin relaxation rate 1/T-2 data in the vicinity of TN. The shorter component seems to be intimately connected with the magnetically ordered state.

BaVO2.9 has been obtained by room temperature oxidation of BaVO2.8 in air and BaVO3.0 obtained by annealing BaVO2.8 or BaVO2.9 at 200-degrees-C in air. The structures of this series of novel compounds have been refined by the Rietveld method using neutron and X-ray diffraction data. Magnetic and electrical properties were examined down to 5 K. All three compounds crystallize in the hexagonal system, space group P3m1BAR and Z = 5. Lattice parameters (angstrom) derived from Si-calibrated Guinier X-ray diffraction data are: BaVO2.8, a = 5.7800(2), c = 11.8969(6); BaVO2.9, a = 5.7215(5), c = 11.685(2); and BaVO3.0, a = 5.6650(3), c = 11.4629(6). The BaVO2.8 Structure consists of face-sharing VO68- and VO69- octahedra that form V3O1214- trimers and of VO44- tetrahedra that share comers with the trimers. The BaVO2.9 and BaVO3.0 structures are similar to BaVO2.8, except that the VO44- tetrahedra in the latter are replaced by VO6 octahedra in the former compounds. The previously reported 24R BaBV7O22 is found to be an intergrowth product of 5H BaVO2.8 (Ba5V5O14) and 9R Ba3V2O8. The hydrogen reduction mechanism of Ba2V2O7 is examined and the initial formation of Ba3V2O8 in the temperature range 650 to 1200-degrees-C has been proven by neutron diffraction. The low stability of BaVO2.8 is analyzed in terms of stress relief of the face-sharing octahedra and the mobility of the unshared tetrahedron comer oxygens. The electrical conductivity increases dramatically with increasing oxygen content in the BaVO3-x series (x = 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0). BaVO2.8 and BaVO2.9 are semiconductors with room temperature resistivities of about 30 and 0. 14 OMEGA . cm, respectively. BaVO3.0 is metallic with a room temperature resistivity of 0.013 OMEGA . cm. The magnetic susceptibility of BaVO2.8 shows a broad maximum at about 20 K, indicative of short range order. The susceptibility of BaVO2.9 has both temperature-independent and Curie-Weiss type paramagnetic contributions, and BaVO3.0 primarily exhibits Pauli paramagnetism.

The phase structure and grain morphology of the ceramics were studied by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the two phases of Ba2V2O7 and Ba-3(VO4)(2) can well coexist at sintering temperatures owing to different crystal structures. The microwave dielectric properties of this system were strongly related to densification, packing fraction, and the volume ratio of Ba2V2O7 and Ba-3(VO4)(2). The quality factor Q x f values and temperature coefficients of the resonant frequency (tau(f)) of the ceramics can be significantly boosted by adjusting the relative content of the two phases. Consequently, a high Q x f value of 71,700 GHz, a near-zero tau(f) of -1.4 ppm/degrees C and a low dielectric constant epsilon(r) of 11.4 were obtained for the x = 0.42 sample sintered at a low temperature of 875 degrees C for 4 h, which are superior to those of several available low-loss dielectrics.

The structural transition temperature, T-s decreases with decreasing V2+ content to a minimum value of 105 K. Crystallographic and DSC data support a first-order transition driven by partial bond formation which results in a 7% reduction in the distance between two of the five crystallographically distinct V atoms. There is no conclusive crystallographic evidence for V2+/V3+ charge ordering in either the Cmca or Pbca forms. Electrical conductivity data show semiconducting behavior above T-s which can be fitted to a small polaron hopping model for the most reduced samples (T-s = 135 K). The same sample shows a sharp but not discontinuous decrease in conductivity below T-s consistent with carrier removal due to bond formation. More oxidized materials with T-s - 105 K show a more subtle anomaly. Evidence for correlated (Efros-Shklovskii) variable-range hopping at low temperatures is seen in the T-s = 105 K sample from analysis using a Hill-Zabrodski (log dE vs. log T) plot. Thermopower data on the T-s = 135 K material show an anomalously small value of S similar to + 1 muV/K at room temperature which increases to > + 200 muV/K upon cooling to 90 K. Plots of dS/d T show evidence for the T-s = 135 K phase transition. These results are not consistent with a simple one carrier model for small polaron hopping assuming that the V2+ ions are the carriers, which would predict S similar to - 100 muV/K, but seem to demand a two carrier model with n similar to p at room temperature for which n-type carriers are trapped as a result of bond formation at the phase transition as temperature is lowered. The lower temperature phase transition near 40 K is magnetic in origin and will be discussed in a subsequent publication. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The topology of the V sublattice, which consists of linked V-10 clusters formed by four tetrahedra sharing edges and corners, leads to geometric magnetic frustration and a depression of the ordering temperature characterized by the frustration index, f=parallel to theta parallel to/T-c similar to 30. Specific heat data show the coexistence of both long range and short range magnetic order at low temperature. The position of a lambda peak, identified with T-c for long range antiferromagnetic order, depends on the V2+/V3+ ratio and varies from 43.0 K to 41.6 K for samples with the highest V2+ content but is suppressed to zero for highly oxidized samples. A broad maximum in the specific heat occurs at similar to 25 K and is present in all samples regardless of the level of oxidation. For samples with a well defined T-c, estimates of the entropy removal over the range 5 K to 55 K are only 11% of that expected for 8 V3+(S=1) and 2 V2+(S=3/2) ions per formula unit, suggesting the presence of considerable short-range order. Neutron diffraction data support the presence of long range antiferromagnetic (AF) order with T-c similar to 40 K. The magnetic structure below T-c is complex: there are five crystallographically independent vanadium ions in the unit cell, leading to 40 magnetic ions in the crystal unit cell and 80 spins per magnetic cell. Furthermore, the magnetic structure is of the multi-k type involving the two unrelated wave vectors k=(0 0 0) and k=(1/2 0 0).

A crystal orbital Hamiltonian population/integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population analysis provides evidence that the crystallographic phase transition is driven by V-V bond formation. As well, the energy bands near the Fermi level are very narrow, < 1 eV, consistent with the fact that the observed insulating behavior can be due to electron localization via either Mott-Hubbard correlation and/or Anderson disorder. The partial solid solution, BaV10-xTixO15, was examined to study the effect of Ti-doping at the V sites on the structure and electronic transport properties. In spite of the non-existence of \"BaTi10O15\", the limiting x = 8, as indicated by a monotonic increase in the cell volume and systematic changes in properties. This limit may be due to the difficulty of stabilizing Ti2+ in this structure. For x = 0.5 both the first order structural phase transition and the magnetic transition at 40 K are quenched. The samples obey the Curie-Weiss law to x = 3 with nearly spin only effective moments along with 0 values which range from - 1090 K (x = 0.5) to - 1629 K (x = 3). For x > 3 a very large, similar to2 x 10(-3) emu/mol, temperature independent (TIP) contribution dominates. Conductivity measurements on sintered, polycrystalline samples show semiconducting behavior for all compositions. Activation energies for Mott hopping derived from high temperature data range from similar to0.1 eV for x = 0.1 and fall to a plateau of 0.06 eV for x = 3-7. Low temperature data for x = 3, 5 and 7 show evidence for Mott variable range hoping (VRH) with a T-1/4 law and in one case between 5 and 17 K, a Efros-Shklovskii correlated hopping, T-1/2 law, was seen, in sharp contrast to BaV10O15 where only the E-S law was observed up to 75 K. Seebeck coefficients are small (< 35 muV/K), positive, roughly TIP and increase with increasing x up to x = 5. This may point to a Heikes hopping of holes but a simple single carrier model is impossible. The compositions for x > 3 are remarkable in that local moment behavior is lost, yet a metallic state is not reached. The failure of this system to be driven metallic even at such high doping levels is not fully understood but it seems clear that disorder induced carrier localization plays a major role.

The structures of this series of novel compounds have been refined by the Rietveld method using neutron and X-ray diffraction data. Magnetic and electrical properties were examined down to 5 K. All three compounds crystallize in the hexagonal system, space group P3m1BAR and Z = 5. Lattice parameters (angstrom) derived from Si-calibrated Guinier X-ray diffraction data are: BaVO2.8, a = 5.7800(2), c = 11.8969(6); BaVO2.9, a = 5.7215(5), c = 11.685(2); and BaVO3.0, a = 5.6650(3), c = 11.4629(6).

The hydrogen reduction mechanism of Ba2V2O7 is examined and the initial formation of Ba3V2O8 in the temperature range 650 to 1200-degrees-C has been proven by neutron diffraction. The low stability of BaVO2.8 is analyzed in terms of stress relief of the face-sharing octahedra and the mobility of the unshared tetrahedron comer oxygens. The electrical conductivity increases dramatically with increasing oxygen content in the BaVO3-x series (x = 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0). BaVO2.8 and BaVO2.9 are semiconductors with room temperature resistivities of about 30 and 0. 14 OMEGA . cm, respectively. BaVO3.0 is metallic with a room temperature resistivity of 0.013 OMEGA . cm. The magnetic susceptibility of BaVO2.8 shows a broad maximum at about 20 K, indicative of short range order. The susceptibility of BaVO2.9 has both temperature-independent and Curie-Weiss type paramagnetic contributions, and BaVO3.0 primarily exhibits Pauli paramagnetism.

In comparison to PbTiO3, we found that the V -O interactions further enhance the ferroelectric instability of PbVO3, and therefore PbVO3 shows a much larger tetragonal distortion than PbTiO3.", "ISSN": "0953-8984", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER", "volume": "22", "authors": ["Yan, SY", "Xie, Y", "Liu, T", "Yu, HT"], "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/22/12/125501/", "issue": "12", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jpcs.2014.02.001", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022369714000341/pdfft?md5=879832b6f8134b8ca8f7f833249cfcc5&pid=1-s2.0-S0022369714000341-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 2014", "title": "High-pressure synthesis of BaVO3: A new cubic perovskite", "abstract": "A new cubic perovskite BaVO3 was synthesized by high-pressure synthesis at 15 GPa, and 1350 degrees C.

The compressibility data could be fitted with a Murnaghan equation of state with the zero-pressure bulk modulus B-0 = 161 (7) GPa and the unit-cell volume at ambient pressure = 387.1(3) angstrom(3) (B' = 4.00). A phase transition involving a symmetry reduction from P6(3)/mmc to P6(3)mc can be reliably detected in the high-pressure data. The estimated transition pressure lies in the range 1.18 < P-c < 3.09 GPa. The transition leads to a breaking of the regular Kagome net formed by part of the V ions. While in the ambient pressure structure all V-V distances in the Kagome net are equal, they split into inter-trimer and intratrimer distances in the high-pressure phase. In general, these changes are comparable to those observed in the corresponding low-temperature transition. However, the pressure-induced transition takes place at a lower unit-cell volume compared with the temperature-induced transition. Furthermore, overall trends for inter-trimer and intra-trimer V-V distances as a function of the unit-cell volume are clearly different for datapoints obtained by variation of pressure and temperature. The behavior of BaV6O11 is compared with that of NaV6O11. While in the latter compound the transition can be explained as a pure volume effect, in BaV6O11 an additional degree of freedom related to the valence distribution among the symmetrically independent vanadium sites has to be taken into account.", "ISSN": "0108-7681", "pub": "ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION B-STRUCTURAL SCIENCE", "volume": "65", "authors": ["Friese, K", "Kanke, Y", "Grzechnik, A"], "DOIlink": "http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S010876810901444X", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "326-333"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jssc.2006.04.059", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459606003483/pdfft?md5=c74e1bea64aac04c5fd2707f193540ea&pid=1-s2.0-S0022459606003483-main.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 2006", "title": "Structural phase transitions in BaV6O11\n", "abstract": "\nBaV6O11 was synthesized under high pressures and crystallizes in a structure closely related to magneto plumbite. [V(1)O-6]-octahedra share common edges and form a Kagome lattice normal to the hexagonal [0 0 1] direction. The layers are connected in the direction of e via trigonal [V(3)O-5]-bipyramids and [V(2)O-6]-octahedra, which share common faces. The Ba-atoms are incorporated into cavities of the vanadium oxide framework and are coordinated by 12 oxygen atoms in the shape of a dodecahedron.\n\nThree magnetic anomalies at approximately 250, 115 and 75K were detected in this compound. All of them are accompanied by anomalies in the specific heat measurement. To characterize possible structural transitions and determine the response of the structure to the magnetic anomalies, single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out in the temperature range from 293 to 80 K. At 250 K the compound undergoes a structural phase transition. The space group above the transition temperature is P6(3)/mmc, at lower temperature the symmetry reduces to P6(3)mc. For the refinements in P6(3)mc an inversion twin model was used, this way accounting for the loss of the center of symmetry. The structural phase transition is characterized by a small displacement of the V(1)-atom (forming the Kagome lattice) out of its central position in the octahedra. As a consequence part of the octahedral edges/angles are increased, while the opposite ones are decreased. One limiting surface of the octahedral sheet is corrugated, while the other one is smoothened with respect to the high-temperature structure. This deformation of the octahedral sheets leads to the corresponding geometrical changes in the other coordination polyhedra.\n\nThe structural response to the magnetic anomaly at 115 K is weak and mainly observable in the geometric parameters concerning the [V(1)O-6]-octahedra and [V(3)O-5]-bipyramids. This may serve as a first indication that the corresponding central atoms play an important role in the mechanism of the magnetic phase transition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The Ba2+ ions order within these layers and direct the occupation of the octahedral sites by V2+ and V3+ ions resulting in a structure with subtle differences from that Of V2O3 which can be described in Cmca at room temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data show evidence for two phase transitions at 135 and 40 K. The higher temperature transition at 135 K is shown to be structural in origin to another orthorhombic form, Pbca. The structural transition temperature, T-s decreases with decreasing V2+ content to a minimum value of 105 K. Crystallographic and DSC data support a first-order transition driven by partial bond formation which results in a 7% reduction in the distance between two of the five crystallographically distinct V atoms. There is no conclusive crystallographic evidence for V2+/V3+ charge ordering in either the Cmca or Pbca forms. Electrical conductivity data show semiconducting behavior above T-s which can be fitted to a small polaron hopping model for the most reduced samples (T-s = 135 K). The same sample shows a sharp but not discontinuous decrease in conductivity below T-s consistent with carrier removal due to bond formation. More oxidized materials with T-s - 105 K show a more subtle anomaly. Evidence for correlated (Efros-Shklovskii) variable-range hopping at low temperatures is seen in the T-s = 105 K sample from analysis using a Hill-Zabrodski (log dE vs. log T) plot. Thermopower data on the T-s = 135 K material show an anomalously small value of S similar to + 1 muV/K at room temperature which increases to > + 200 muV/K upon cooling to 90 K. Plots of dS/d T show evidence for the T-s = 135 K phase transition. These results are not consistent with a simple one carrier model for small polaron hopping assuming that the V2+ ions are the carriers, which would predict S similar to - 100 muV/K, but seem to demand a two carrier model with n similar to p at room temperature for which n-type carriers are trapped as a result of bond formation at the phase transition as temperature is lowered. The lower temperature phase transition near 40 K is magnetic in origin and will be discussed in a subsequent publication. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

BaVO2.9 has been obtained by room temperature oxidation of BaVO2.8 in air and BaVO3.0 obtained by annealing BaVO2.8 or BaVO2.9 at 200-degrees-C in air. The structures of this series of novel compounds have been refined by the Rietveld method using neutron and X-ray diffraction data. Magnetic and electrical properties were examined down to 5 K. All three compounds crystallize in the hexagonal system, space group P3m1BAR and Z = 5. Lattice parameters (angstrom) derived from Si-calibrated Guinier X-ray diffraction data are: BaVO2.8, a = 5.7800(2), c = 11.8969(6); BaVO2.9, a = 5.7215(5), c = 11.685(2); and BaVO3.0, a = 5.6650(3), c = 11.4629(6). The BaVO2.8 Structure consists of face-sharing VO68- and VO69- octahedra that form V3O1214- trimers and of VO44- tetrahedra that share comers with the trimers. The BaVO2.9 and BaVO3.0 structures are similar to BaVO2.8, except that the VO44- tetrahedra in the latter are replaced by VO6 octahedra in the former compounds. The previously reported 24R BaBV7O22 is found to be an intergrowth product of 5H BaVO2.8 (Ba5V5O14) and 9R Ba3V2O8. The hydrogen reduction mechanism of Ba2V2O7 is examined and the initial formation of Ba3V2O8 in the temperature range 650 to 1200-degrees-C has been proven by neutron diffraction. The low stability of BaVO2.8 is analyzed in terms of stress relief of the face-sharing octahedra and the mobility of the unshared tetrahedron comer oxygens. The electrical conductivity increases dramatically with increasing oxygen content in the BaVO3-x series (x = 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0). BaVO2.8 and BaVO2.9 are semiconductors with room temperature resistivities of about 30 and 0. 14 OMEGA . cm, respectively. BaVO3.0 is metallic with a room temperature resistivity of 0.013 OMEGA . cm. The magnetic susceptibility of BaVO2.8 shows a broad maximum at about 20 K, indicative of short range order. The susceptibility of BaVO2.9 has both temperature-independent and Curie-Weiss type paramagnetic contributions, and BaVO3.0 primarily exhibits Pauli paramagnetism.

By defining a low-energy Hubbard Hamiltonian in the basis of Wannier functions for the t(2g) LDA band and solving it in the single-site dynamical mean-field (DMFT) approximation, it was recently shown (Pavarini et al (2004) Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 176403) that simultaneously with the Mott transition there occurs a strong suppression of orbital fluctuations due to splitting of the t(2g) levels. The present paper reviews and expands this work, in particular in the direction of exposing the underlying chemical mechanisms by means of ab initio LDA Wannier functions generated with the Nth order muffin-tin orbital (NMTO) method. The Wannier functions for the occupied oxygen-p band illustrate the importance of oxygen-p to large cation-d covalency for the progressive GdFeO3-type distortion along the series. The oxygen-porbitals which pd sigma-bond to the cations are the same as those which pd pi-bond to the transition-metal t(2g) orbitals. As a consequence, the Wannier functions for the t(2g) band exhibit residual covalency between the transition-metal t(2g), the large cation-d, and the oxygen-p states. This residual covalency, which increases along the series, turns out to be responsible not only for the splittings, Delta, of the t(2g) levels, but also for non-cubic perturbations of the hopping integrals, both of which are decisive for the Mott transition. We find good agreement with the optical and photoemission spectra for all four materials, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital polarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization volume (pressure) for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted and the role of the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion is discussed. For use in future many-body calculations, we tabulate the t(2g) on-site and hopping matrix elements for all four materials and give an analytical expression for the orthorhombic Hamiltonian in the k + Q representation. Using conventional super-exchange theory, our on-site and hopping matrix elements reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and YTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 where, without the JT distortion, the magnetic orderwould be antiferromagnetic C- or A-type, rather than ferromagnetic. It is decisive that upon increasing the GdFeO3-type distortion, the nearest-neighbour hopping between the lowest and the upper-level Wannier functions becomes stronger than the hopping between the lowest-level Wannier functions. Finally, we show that the non-cubic perturbations responsible for this behaviour make it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t(2g) LDA bandstructure to a pseudo-cubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated from the two others by a direct gap and has a width, W-I, which is significantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t(2g) band. The progressive GdFeO3-type distortion thus favours electron localization by decreasing W, by increasing Delta/W, and by decreasing W-I/W. Our conclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with those of Mochizuki and Imada (2003 Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\n91 67203).", "ISSN": "1367-2630", "pub": "NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS", "volume": "7", "authors": ["Pavarini, E", "Yamasaki, A", "Nuss, J", "Andersen, OK"], "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/7/1/188/", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.52.13711", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "NOV 15 1995", "title": "SPECTRAL WEIGHT TRANSFER AND MASS RENORMALIZATION IN MOTT-HUBBARD SYSTEMS SRVO3 AND CAVO3 - INFLUENCE OF LONG-RANGE COULOMB INTERACTION", "abstract": "We have studied metallic SrVO3 and CaVO3 by inverse photoemission and high-resolution photoemission.

This difference in the effect of oxygen vacancies between SrVO3-delta and CaVO3-delta reflects the fact that a metal-insulator phase transition induced by bulk oxygen vacancies takes place in CaVO3-delta but not in SrVO3-delta.", "ISSN": "0163-1829", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "47", "authors": ["AIURA, Y", "IGA, F", "NISHIHARA, Y", "OHNUKI, H", "KATO, H"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.47.6732", "issue": "11", "pages": "6732-6735"}, {"DOI": "10.1143/JPSJ.63.409", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 1994", "title": "ANNEALING EFFECTS ON TRANSPORT AND MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES OF PEROVSKITE-TYPE VANADIUM-OXIDE CAVO3\n", "abstract": "We report transport and magnetic properties for single-crystalline CaVO3, which are seriously affected by oxygen off-stoichiometry.

In addition, the effective mass of photogenerated carriers in SrNbO3 with isotropic characteristic is the smallest, which implies that the photogenerated carriers can transfer to the surface reaction sites more easily with less recombination. Therefore, SrNbO3 should be of better photocatalytic performance.

The cluster model results are in good agreement with previous photoemission and X-ray absorption spectra. In CaVO3, the coherent structure is mostly due to a coherent screened 3d(1)C_ state, whereas the incoherent feature is mainly related to a ligand screened 3d(1)L_ state. In YVO3, the incoherent feature remains mainly related to a ligand screened 3d(2)L_ state, but the Mott-Hubbard screened 3d(2)D_ state appears at higher energies. The opening of the band gap is related to the transfer of spectra weight, from the 3d(1)C_ state in metallic CaVO3 to the 3d(2)D_ in insulating YVO3. The band gap in insulating YVO3 scales mainly with the charge-transfer energy Delta. Further, the larger orthorhombic distortion in YVO3 also favors the insulating state. The results show that CaVO3 is closer to the charge-transfer than to the Mott-Hubbard regime. On the other hand, the YVO3 compound is in a heavily O 2p-V 3d mixed intermediate regime.

In the V2O5 layers of alpha'-NaV2O5, CaV2O5 and MgV2O5, ladder chains of vanadium atoms are arranged in a staggered manner. CaV2O5 and MgV2O5 have an unpaired spin at each vanadium site, while alpha'-NaV2O5 has one unpaired spin in each rung of the ladder chains. The latter makes alpha'-NaV2O5 behave as a spin 1/2 Heisenberg linear chain system. Madelung energy and bond valence sum calculations for alpha'-NaV2O5 show that the pairing distortion from the uniform spin lattice to the zigzag spin lattice proposed by Seo and Fukuyama is energetically favorable. In the zigzag spin lattice the paired spins do not reside in the ladder chains but in between the ladder chains, which makes alpha'-NaV2O5 different from a simple spin-Peierls system.

The magnitudes of the exchange couplings estimated here account for the spin-flop phenomena and their composition dependences are consistent with those of the V-V distances and V-O-V angles.", "ISSN": "0953-8984", "pub": "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER", "volume": "14", "authors": ["Nishiguchi, N", "Onoda, M", "Kubo, K"], "DOIlink": "http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/14/23/307/", "issue": "23", "pages": "5731-5746"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0022-3697(99)00066-9", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022369799000669/pdfft?md5=6d103ce7058e6cd4bb85f8ae295713ef&pid=1-s2.0-S0022369799000669-main.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG-SEP 1999", "title": "Magnetic neutron scattering study of SrV3O7", "abstract": "Neutron powder diffraction experiments were performed for SrV3O7, which is characterized by the 1/4 depleted V4+(S = 1/2) square lattice model.

Calcium in the high calcium type stone coal is greatly superfluous relative to vanadium, hence, the calcium reacts with vanadium to form Ca(VO3)(2), Ca2V2O7 and Ca-3(VO4)(2) orderly during the stone coal roasting process and high temperature is beneficial to the reactions between calcium and vanadium, which was validated by simulated reactions between pure calcium carbonate and vanadium pentoxide.

The regeneration of iron oxide during each regeneration stage reached 98% and that of the modified CaO was above 94%; however, a gradual decline in the performance of the solids after the third cycle occurred because of sorbent sintering.

The catalytic activity was found to decrease rapidly with the K2O loading, irrespective of the similar textural properties of all samples. Addition of K2O modified the vanadium species on the catalyst surface. For large additions of K2O, the potassium partially reacted with V2O5 to form KVO3. The amount of NH3 chemisorbed on the catalyst was observed to decrease with both the loading of K2O and the temperature. The adsorption of NH3 on both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites was confirmed. The strength and the number of Bronsted acid sites decrease largely with the loading of K2O in parallel with the decrease of the SCR activity, suggesting that the SCR reaction involves NH3 adsorption on the Bronsted acid sires. At low surface coverage of NH3, the isosteric heat of NH3 chemisorption was determined to be 370 kJ/mol for 0 wt.% K2O addition. With increasing K2O amount, the heat of adsorption decreased and was 150 kJ/mol for the catalyst with higher amounts of K2O addition. The results obtained imply that potassium disturbs the formation of the active ammonia intermediates, NH4+, resulting in deactivation of the catalyst. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is shown that some of these mixtures have a high activity above their melting point of about 625 K. The activity of these catalysts can be up to five times higher than the activity of chemically related solid oxide catalysts and this activity is observed throughout the complete conversion trajectory of the soot, The high activity is explained by the better contact between soot and catalyst, which is probably mainly achieved by wetting of the soot by the liquid catalyst, and not via the vapour phase. The eutectic catalysts studied do not evaporate at high temperature. Furthermore, MoO3 and KCl-KVO3 were studied, two catalysts reported in literature to be significantly active. It was found that the high activity of MoO3 is a result of vapour phase mobility. Catalyst selection procedures were evaluated. Thermobalance equipment should be used with caution for the selection of soot oxidation catalysts, because catalytic activities can be overestimated. A low heating rate, preferably 1 K/min or lower, is recommended for temperature programmed oxidation experiments with these types of catalyst.

The ratio of different vanadia species was controlled by treating the catalysts in diluted HNO3, which removes bulk vanadia and polymeric vanadia species, but not the monomeric ones, as was shown by FT-Raman spectroscopy and TPR in H-2. Monolayer vanadia species (monomeric and polymeric) are responsible for the catalytic activity and selectivity to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid independently on the catalyst preparation method. Bulk V2O5 and TiO2 are considerably less active. Therefore, an increase of the vanadium concentration in the samples above the monolayer coverage results in a decrease of the specific rate in toluene oxidation due to the partial blockage of active monolayer species by bulk crystalline V2O5. Potassium diminishes the catalyst acidity resulting in a decrease of the total rate of toluene oxidation and suppression of deactivation. Deactivation due to coking is probably related to the Bronsted acid sites associated with the bridging oxygen in the polymeric species and bulk V2O5. Doping by K diminishes the amount of active monolayer vanadia leading to the formation of non-active K-doped monomeric vanadia species and KVO3. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Monomeric and polymeric VOx species and V2O5 were detected by V-51 NMR on pure and K-doped catalysts. For the K-doped samples the polymeric species were observed only at high V content and new tetrahedral VOx species and traces of KVO3 appeared.

The pattern of the activity and selectivity changes with the total V content depends on the amount of K on the support surface: with K < 1 ML, the maximum activity and selectivity is observed at a vanadium content corresponding to ca. 40% of a V2O5 ML. At higher K content, higher amounts of vanadium (> 1 ML) are required to obtain the same catalytic performance.

Deactivation effects caused by alkali (earth) metals were well associated with alkalinity value and shown in sequence as: K > Na similar to Ca > Mg. Results also indicated that the deactivation increased proportionately with alkali (earth) metal doping amounts. Further investigations on BET surface area, XRD, Hg-TPD, XPS and H-2-TPR demonstrated that surface characteristics were not the dominant factor for the deactivation. However, surface coverage by alkali (earth) metals might cause decrease in the surface area and total pore volume. Hg-TPD results indicated that the doping of alkali (earth) metals would decrease surface Hg-0 adsorption amount associated with alkalinity value. More decrease of surface adsorption and redox ability (O alpha) in doped catalysts than the fresh one could lead to less active performance according to the H-2-TPR and XPS of O 1s results. Consequently, the decrease of Hg-0 adsorption and surface redox ability (O alpha), and the formation of inactive metavanadate species such as KVO3 could be responsible for the deactivation performance caused by alkali (earth) metals over vanadium-based catalyst for oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury.

A sound methodology is suggested for calculating the EFG tensor in pyrovanadates which contain isolated V2O74- clusters.

Further restrictions on these parameters may arise from non-crystallographic graph symmetries. Convenient graphtheoretical calculation schemes are described for both approaches.

We have found, however, that the low temperature heat conduction of some solids increases by more than a factor of two with the application of a modest magnetic field. The effect occurs in low-dimensional magnetically ordered materials when a small gap, Delta, in the acoustic magnon (spin-wave) spectra is closed using a magnetic field H > Delta/g mu(B). Since all magnetically ordered materials must have a gap in the magnon spectra for magnons with k approximate to 0, this may be a very general effect. Extra heat is carried through the solid only when the magnetic field exceeds the critical value (H > Delta/g mu(B)). At this critical field the tiny atomic magnets in the solid abruptly change the direction they point which results in more heat flowing through the material.

The BiVO4 photocatalysts were obtained by the reaction of layered potassium vanadate powder (KV3O8 and K3V5O14) With Bi(NO3)(3) for 3 days in aqueous media at room temperature. Highly crystalline monoclinic and tetragonal BiVO4 were selectively synthesized by changing the ratio of vanadium to bismuth in the starting materials. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy measurements showed that the monoclinic BiVO4 was formed via a tetragonal BiVO4 intermediate. Tetragonal BiVO4 with a 2.9 eV band gap mainly possessed an ultraviolet absorption band while monoclinic BiVO4 with a 2.4 eV band gap had a characteristic visible light absorption band in addition to the UV band. The UV bands observed in the tetragonal and monoclinic BiVO4 were assigned to the band transition from O-2p to V-3d whereas the visible light absorption was due to the transition from a valence band formed by Bi-6s or a hybrid orbital of Bi-6s and O-2p to a conduction band of V-3d. The photocatalytic activity for O-2 evolution from an aqueous silver nitrate solution under UV irradiation (300 < lambda < 380 nm) on the tetragonal BiVO4 was comparable to that on the monoclinic BiVO4. The monoclinic BiVO4 also showed the high photocatalytic activity for the O-2 evolution under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). When the monoclinic BiVO4 was calcined at 700-800 K the activity was increased. The activity of this monoclinic BiVO4 was much higher than that of BiVO4 prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction.

Given the myocardial contractile reserve elicited by endogenous catecholamines during exercise, it may be speculated that patients with a significant amount of myocardial viability (MV) could show a faster KVO(2) at the onset of exercise attributable to a faster increase in stroke volume compared to patients without MV.\n\nObjectives: To demonstrate a relationship between contractile reserve detected by low-dose dobutamine Echocardiography (LDDE) and KVO(2) obtained during cardiopulmonary testing in patients with ischemic LVD.\n\nMethods: Forty-one consecutive patients (62.5 +/- 10.1 years) with ischemic LVD underwent LDDE and constant work rate exercise with KVO(2) determination. The time constant for VO(2) (tau) was determined by a curve fitting breath-by-breath data. Ten healthy subjects served as control group (59.5 +/- 13.4 years).\n\nResults: LDDE identified contractile reserve in 20 (48%) subjects. Patients without MV detected by LDDE showed a significantly longer tau compared to patients with MV and to healthy subjects (p=0.03 and p=0.01, respectively). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of tau in detecting MV were 90%, 95%, 95% and 91%, respectively. Moreover, the percentage reduction of LV wall motion score index detected at LDDE was significantly related to KVO2 (r=0.71, p<0.01).\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that KVO(2) represents a reasonable initial approach to estimate presence of MV in patients with ischemic LVD.

Both techniques also show the existence of a third phase coexisting with the low- and high-pressure phases in a limited pressure range close to the transition pressure. XRD studies revealed a highly anisotropic compression in orthorhombic InVO4. In addition, the compressibility becomes nonlinear in the HP polymorph. The volume collapse in the lattice is related to an increase of the polyhedral coordination around the vanadium atoms. The transformation is not fully reversible.

These coatings were prepared by air plasma spray (APS). Characterizations using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicate that in the case of YSZ, the reaction between sodium vanadate (NaVO3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) produces yttrium vanadate (YVO4) and leads to the transformation of tetragonal zirconia to monoclinic zirconia. For the CSZ coatings, by the formation of cerium vanadate (CeVO4), the amount of yttrium vanadate formed on the CSZ coating is significantly reduced, thus the amount of monoclinic phase in the TBC coating is substantially reduced. For TiSZ coating, although some minor reactions happened and some titanium vanadate (TiVO4) ribbons formed on the surface of coating, tetragonal zirconia was stable after hot corrosion test and no monoclinic zirconia was formed. Comparing to YSZ and CSZ under a temperature of 1050 degrees C, TiSZ coating is found to be more stable, both thermally and chemically, and exhibits a better hot corrosion resistance.", "ISSN": "0947-5117", "pub": "MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION", "volume": "66", "authors": ["Habibi, MH", "Guo, SM"], "DOIlink": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/maco.201307331/abstract;jsessionid=BCAC9EA2E852D5098436C572362BB0BB.f01t04", "issue": "3", "pages": "270-277"}, {"DOI": "10.1007/s10563-015-9184-4", "pdflink": "http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10563-015-9184-4.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 2015", "title": "Pellet Vanadia Catalysts for Oxidative Destruction of 1,2-Dichlorobenzene: Roles of the Grafted TiO2 in Vanadia Morphology and Catalytic Reaction", "abstract": "Vanadia redox catalysts, V2O5/SiO2, V2O5/TiO2, and V2O5/TiO2-SiO2 having different structures were prepared by incorporating vanadium oxytripropoxide on granular SiO2, TiO2 nano-particles, and TiO2-grafted-SiO2 pellets, respectively. In order to accelerate the catalyst deactivation, the catalysts were tested for oxidation of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with temperature elevated from 200 to 550 A degrees C. Using EXAFS and XRPD, the structural changes in the accelerated aging tests were characterized to assess the catalyst stability and the role of the grafted TiO2 in catalysis. The correlation of catalyst structures with catalytic reaction results indicated that: (1) the grafted TiO2 helps anchoring and dispersing vanadia in the catalyst preparation; (2) monomeric vanadia species with umbrella geometry, polymeric VO4, and TiVO4 coexisting with V2O5 clusters were formed on TiO2-SiO2 pellet, granular SiO2, and TiO2 nano-particles, respectively; (3) oxidative destruction of o-DCB induces the aggregation of vanadia species on the supports leading to a decrease of catalytic activity; (4) lower total oxidation selectivity for V2O5/TiO2 as opposed to the other two catalyst samples could be due to the presence of higher Bronsted-to-Lewis acid sites ratio; (5) a decrease of vanadium-atoms valence charge induced by TiO2-V2O5 interactions alleviates strong

Culicidae) to transmit West Nile virus", "abstract": "Since first discovered in the New York City area in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has become established over much of the continental United States and has been responsible for >10,000 cases of severe disease and 400 human fatalities, as well as thousands of fatal infections in horses. To develop appropriate surveillance and control strategies, the identification of which mosquito species are competent vectors and how various factors influence their ability to transmit this virus must be determined. Therefore, we evaluated numerous mosquito species for their ability to transmit MNV under laboratory conditions. This report contains data for several mosquito species not reported previously, as well as a summary of transmission data compiled from previously reported studies. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on chickens infected with WNV isolated from a crow that died during the 1999 outbreak in New York City. These mosquitoes were tested approximate to2 wk later to determine infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. All Culex species tested were competent vectors in the laboratory and varied from highly efficient vectors (e.g., Cures tarsalis Coquillett) to moderately efficient ones (e.g., Culex nigripalpus Theobald). Nearly all of the Culex species tested could serve a; efficient enzootic or amplifying vectors for WNV. Several container-breeding Aedes and Ochlerotatus species were highly efficient vectors under laboratory conditions, but because of their feeding preferences, would probably not be involved in the maintenance of WNV in nature.

In contrast, most of the surface pool-breeding Aedes and Ochlerotatus species tested were relatively inefficient vectors wider laboratory conditions and would probably not play a significant role in transmitting WNV in nature.

As a result of the lack of a mammalian cell culture model for these viruses, studies on persistence, inactivation, and transmission have been limited to cultivable viruses, including feline calicivirus (FCV). Recently, reports of the successful cell culture of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) have provided investigators with an alternative surrogate for human NoVs. In this study, we compared the inactivation profiles of MNV-1 to FCV in an effort to establish the relevance of MNV-1 as a surrogate virus. Specifically, we evaluated (i) stability upon exposure to pH extremes; (ii) stability upon exposure to organic solvents; (iii) thermal inactivation; and (iv) surface persistence under wet and dry conditions. MNV-1 was stable across the entire pH range tested (pH 2 to 10) with less than 1 log reduction in infectivity at pH 2, whereas FCV was inactivated rapidly at pH values < 3 and > 9. FCV was more stable than MNV-1 at 56 degrees C, but both viruses exhibited similar inactivation at 63 and 72 degrees C. Long-term persistence of both viruses suspended in a fecal matrix and inoculated onto stainless steel coupons were similar at 4 degrees C, but at room temperature in solution, MNV-1 was more stable than FCV The genetic relatedness of MNV-1 to human NoVs combined with its ability to survive under gastric pH levels makes this virus a promising and relevant surrogate for studying environmental survival of human NoVs.", "ISSN": "0362-028X", "pub": "JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION", "volume": "69", "authors": ["Cannon, JL", "Papafragkou, E", "Park, GW", "Osborne, J", "Jaykus, LA", "Vinje, J"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "11", "pages": "2761-2765"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja00010a025", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 8 1991", "title": "THE PEROXIDE-DEPENDENT MU-2-O BOND FORMATION OF [MN(IV)SALPN(O)]2", "abstract": "A variety of Mn(III)SALPN complexes as monomeric and dimeric derivatives have been prepared.  Acetonitrile solutions of tetragonal complexes such as [Mn(III)(SALPN)(CH3OH)2]ClO4, 1, are unreactive with hydrogen peroxide unless base is added.  In contrast, [Mn(III)(SALPN)(AcAc)], 2, [Mn(III)(SALPN)(OCH3)]2, 3, and Mn(III)2(SALPN)3, 4, internally carry an equivalent of base and react rapidly to form the oxidized dimer [Mn(IV)(SALPN)(O)]2, 5.  The base is required to deprotonate hydrogen peroxide prior to reaction with 1-4.  Alkyl peroxides such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide also require base for reactivity but appear to follow a different mechanistic pathway consistent with the slow loss of tert-butoxide leading to Mn(V)OSALPN, 19.  The conversion of 2, 3, or 4 to 5 has been examined with use of isotopically labeled hydrogen peroxide and ring-substituted ligand derivatives.  These data demonstrate that the first intermediate in the reaction is probably a monomeric hydroperoxide adduct [Mn(III)(SALPN)(O2H)], 16.  The monomer 16 then reacts with another equivalent of Mn(III)(SALPN)(X) to form a peroxo-bridged dimer (SALPN)Mn(III)(O2)Mn(III)(SALPN), 17, which undergoes internal electron transfer forming 5.

The discovery of murine norovirus (MNV) and its ability to productively infect cultured murine macrophages and dendritic cells has provided an opportunity to determine the functional consequences of norovirus diversity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we compared the full-length genornes of 21 new MNV isolates with five previously sequenced MNV genomes and demonstrated a conserved genomic organization consisting of four open reading frames (ORFs) and a previously unknown region of nucleotide conservation in ORF2. A phylogenetic analysis of all 26 MNV genomes revealed 15 distinct MNV strains, with up to 13% divergence at the nucleotide level, that comprise a single genotype and genogroup. Evidence for recombination within ORF2 in several MNV genomes was detected by multiple methods. Serological analyses comparing neutralizing antibody responses between highly divergent strains suggested that the MNV genogroup comprises a single serotype. Within this single genogroup, MNV strains exhibited considerable biological diversity in their ability to grow in culture and to infect and/or persist in wild-type mice.

We further defined interferon receptors and the STAT-1 molecule as critical in both resistance to MNV-1-induced disease in vivo and control of virus growth in vitro. To date, neither histopathological changes upon infection nor viral replication in wild-type mice has been shown. Here we extend our studies to demonstrate that MNV-1 replicates and rapidly disseminates to various tissues in immunocompetent mice and that infection is restricted by STAT1-dependent interferon responses at the levels of viral replication and virus dissemination. Infection of wild-type mice is associated with histopathological alterations in the intestine (mild inflammation) and the spleen (red pulp hypertrophy and white pulp activation); viral dissemination to the spleen, liver, lung, and lymph nodes; and low-level persistent infection in the spleen. STAT-1 inhibits viral replication in the intestine, prevents virus-induced apoptosis of intestinal cells and splenocytes, and limits viral dissemination to peripheral tissues.

SV-11 is thus a recombinant between the plus and minus strands of MNV-11 resulting in a nearly palindromic sequence.

Murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1) is one of several murine noroviruses isolated from research mouse facilities and has been used as a model of human norovirus infection. MNV-1 infection has been shown to require components of innate and adaptive immunity for clearance; however, the initial host protein that recognizes MNV-1 infection is unknown. Because noroviruses are RNA viruses, we investigated whether MDA5 and TLR3, cellular sensors that recognize dsRNA, are important for the host response to MNV-1. We demonstrate that MDA5(-/-) dendritic cells(DC) have a defect in cytokine response to MNV-1. In addition, MNV-1 replicates to higher levels in MDA5(-/-) DCs as well as in MDA5(-/-) mice in vivo. Interestingly, TLR3(-/-) DCs do not have a defect in vitro, but TLR3(-/-) mice have a slight increase in viral titers. This is the first demonstration of an innate immune sensor for norovirus and shows that MDA5 is required for the control of MNV-1 infection.

The density of MNV was determined by morphometry of aortic sections stained for endothelium. The spatial distribution of aortic microvessels was compared with that of elastin destruction and chronic inflammation.\n\nResults: Evidence of medial neovascularization was generally not observed in normal aorta or AOD, whereas AAAs showed strong spatial correlations between MNV, disruption and degradation of elastin, and chronic inflammation in the outer aortic wall. Several specimens of AOD had focal areas of MNV associated with localized elastin fragmentation and monocytic infiltration located at the interface between the atherosclerotic plaque and the inner media. The density of MNV was about fifteenfold higher in AAA compared with normal aorta and about threefold higher compared with AOD (microvessels per high-power field): normal aorta, 0.77 +/- 0.28; AOD, 3.40 +/- 0.51; AAA, 11.32 +/- 1.58 (ANOVA, p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: The presence and density of MNV in the abdominal aorta is a consistent histopathologic marker of aneurysmal. degeneration that is spatially correlated with the destruction of elastin and chronic inflammation.

This difference and the state ordering for each system are rationalized based on the competition between the intrinsic tendency of manganese to prefer high-spin electronic configurations. vis-A-vis the general tendency to prefer double occupancy in the low-lying orbitals. The outcome of this competition is determined primarily by the identity of the macrocycle, corrole versus porphyrin.

However, little is known regarding the norovirus life cycle, including cell binding and entry. In contrast to human noroviruses, the recently discovered murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) readily infects murine macrophages and dendritic cells in culture. Many viruses, including the related feline calicivirus, use terminal sialic acids (SA) as receptors for infection. Therefore, we tested whether SA moieties play a role during MNV-1 infection of murine macrophages. Competition with SA-binding lectins and neuraminidase treatment led to a reduction in MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages, suggesting a role for SA during the initial steps of the MNV-1 life cycle. Because SA moieties can be attached to glycolipids (i.e., gangliosides), we next determined whether MNV-1 uses gangliosides during infection. The gangliosides GD1a, GM1, and asialo-GM1 (GA1) are natural components of murine macrophages. MNV-1 bound to ganglioside GD1a, which is characterized by an SA on the terminal galactose, but not to GM1 or asialo-GM1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The depletion of gangliosides using an inhibitor of glycosylceramide synthase (D-threo-P4) led to a reduction of MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages. This defect was specifically rescued by the addition of GD1a. A similar phenotype was observed for MNV field strains WU11 (GV/WU11/2005/USA) and S99 (GV/Berlin/2006/DE).

The (31)P NMR spectra of P2W17MnIII with excess F5PhI(TFAc) 2 at -50 and -20 degrees C showed a pair of narrow peaks attributed to a diamagnetic, singlet manganese(V)oxo species, P(2)W(17)Mn(V)=O.

Further calculations using both the UBLYP and UB3LYP functionals for epoxidation and hydroxylation of propene showed lowest lying triplet transition states for both transformations, while singlet and quintet transition states were of higher energy. The calculations especially after corrections for the solvent effect indicate that [PMn(V)=OW(11)O(39)](4-) should be highly reactive, even more reactive than analogous MnVdO porphyrin species. Kinetic measurements of the reaction of P(2)W(17)Mn(V)=O with 1-octene indicated, however, that P(2)W(17)Mn(V)=O was less reactive than a MnVdO porphyrin. The experimental enthalpy of activation confirmed that the energy barrier for epoxidation is low, but the highly negative entropy of activation leads to a high free energy of activation. This result originates in our view from the strong solvation of the highly charged polyoxometalate by the polar solvent used and adventitious water. The higher negative charge of the polyoxometalate in the transition versus ground state leads to electrostriction of the solvent molecules and to a loss of degrees of freedom, resulting in a highly negative entropy of activation and slower reactions.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "128", "authors": ["Khenkin, AM", "Kumar, D", "Shaik, S", "Neumann, R"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0638455", "issue": "48", "pages": "15451-15460"}, {"DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M602230200", "pdflink": "http://www.jbc.org/site/misc/ASBMBjournals_MEDIAKIT.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 1 2006", "title": "Caliciviruses differ in their functional requirements for eIF4F components", "abstract": "Two classes of viruses, namely members of the Potyviridae and Caliciviridae, use a novel mechanism for the initiation of protein synthesis that involves the interaction of translation initiation factors with a viral protein covalently linked to the viral RNA, known as VPg. The calicivirus VPg proteins can interact directly with the initiation factors eIF4E and eIF3. Translation initiation on feline calicivirus (FCV) RNA requires eIF4E because it is inhibited by recombinant 4E-BP1. However, to date, there have been no functional studies carried out with respect to norovirus translation initiation, because of a lack of a suitable source of VPg-linked viral RNA. We have now used the recently identified murine norovirus (MNV) as a model system for norovirus translation and have extended our previous studies with FCV RNA to examine the role of the other eIF4F components in translation initiation. We now demonstrate that, as with FCV, MNV VPg interacts directly with eIF4E, although, unlike FCV RNA, translation of MNV RNA is not sensitive to 4E-BP1, eIF4E depletion, or foot-and-mouth disease virus Lb protease-mediated cleavage of eIF4G. We also demonstrate that both FCV and MNV RNA translation require the RNA helicase component of the eIF4F complex, namely eIF4A, because translation was sensitive (albeit to different degrees) to a dominant negative form and to a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A (hippuristanol).

In this report, a reverse-genetics system for MNV is described, using a fowlpox virus (FWPV) recombinant expressing T7 RNA polymerase to recover genetically defined MNV in tissue culture for the first time. These studies demonstrated that approaches that have proved successful for other members of the family Caliciviridae failed to lead to recovery of MNV.

The FAP score is a quantitative means of assessing gait based on specific spatial and temporal gait parameters.\n\nParticipants: 11 volunteers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, (mean age = 74.3), and I I age matched volunteers, (mean age = 70.3), with no history of neurological disorder participated in the study. The non-impaired control group were not matched in age and sex but of similar age and males and females were represented in the control group.\n\nMethods: Temporal and spatial parameters of gait were analyzed for both preferred- speed and fast-speed walking using the computerized GaitRite system. The system integrates specific components of locomotion to provide a single, numerical representation of gait, the Functional Ambulation Performance Score (FAP) score.\n\nResults: The most powerful and discriminating variable between Parkinson's and non-impaired groups for both walking speeds was the mean normalized velocity (MNV). Which is velocity divided by leg length. The MNV was 0.83 for PD at preferred walking speed and 1.14 at fast speed, the non-impaired group preferred-speed group walking was 1.33, while fast-speed walking MNV was 1.70. Note the fast walking of PD was slower than the preferred velocity of the non-impaired group. For preferred-speed walking, all gait variables analyzed in the study were different between the two groups beyond the p < 0.05 level of confidence with the single exception of right stance percentage. For fast-speed walking, three of the entered variables did not discriminate between the two groups: the fast walking FAP score, left fast-walking cadence, and right fast-walking single support percentage.\n\nConclusion and discussion: Our results indicate that persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) attain a significantly lower FAP score when ambulating at their preferred rate and demonstrate shorter step length and a longer step time than the age matched non-impaired group during both preferred and fast velocities of walking. Stance duration and double support duration were increased for the Parkinson's population, whereas single support duration, mean cadence, and heel-to-heel base of support were markedly reduced for both walking speeds. The FAP score was significantly different from the non-impaired control group for preferred-speed walking.

Here we report the structure determination of a new phase, alpha-Mn2V2O7, and the structure refinement of beta-Mn2V2O7 from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. alpha-Mn2V2O7 crystallizes in the space group P (1) over bar (no. 2) with a = 6.868(2) Angstrom, b = 7.976(2) Angstrom, c = 10.927(2) Angstrom, alpha = 87.81(1)degrees, beta = 72.14(1)degrees, gamma = 83.08(1)degrees, V = 564.5(5) Angstrom(3), Z = 4 at T = 293 K. beta-Mn2V2O7 crystallizes in the space group C2/m (no. 12) with a = 6.7129(6) Angstrom, b 8.7245(5) Angstrom, c = 4.9693(4) Angstrom, beta = 103.591(8)degrees, V = 282.88(4) Angstrom(3), Z = 2 at T = 323 K. beta-Mn2V2O7 adopts the thortveitite structure containing edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra and corner-sharing V2O74- divanadate groups, which have staggered conformation and linear V-O-b-V. The structure of alpha-Mn2V2O7, differs from that of beta-Mn2V2O7 mainly by the bending of V-O-b-V moieties, as observed in the low-temperature forms of other thortveitite like compounds. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that a reversible first-order phase transition occurs at similar to 296 K. The low-temperature phase exhibits a paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition at T-N = 16.0(5)K and follows Curie-Weiss behavior (mu(eff) = 5.9 mu(B)/Mn atom) at higher temperature. A change of Weiss constants (theta p = -28 K for alpha-Mn2V2O7; -4 K for beta-Mn2V2O7) relevant to the alpha-beta phase transition was observed between 290 and 300 K.

The system can be visualized as an equilateral triangle with X = 100x and Y = 100y coordinates along the MnV2O6-MoO3 and MnV2O6-AgVMoO6 arms, respectively, The limit of the existence of MnAg Phi is almost linear and extends between the X-Y points S-1 = (45,00) and S-2 = (12,88), As the ionic radii of dopants (Ag+/Mn2+), Mo6+/V5+) are larger than those of the mother cations, the lattice constants in both series-MnAg and almost saturated MnAg Phi (located along the S1S2 curve-rise systematically with an increase in Y. Behind the S1S2 curve, saturated MnAg Phi has been observed accompanied by \"hexagonal MoO3\" (h-MoO3), Y phase = Mn0.15V0.3Mo0.7O6, by (MoxV1-x)(2)O-5, and sometimes by orthorhombic MoO3 and MnMoO4. According to the literature, so-called h-MoO3 is a defective tunnel structure stabilized by the inserted free or hydrated L = K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+ ions, The formula of dry h-MoO3 is L0.13V0.13Mo0.87O3(I). Ag was believed to be too small to stabilize the peculiar h-MnO3. Despite that, we observed Ag-containing h-MoO3 in the field of the MnV2O6-AgVMoO6-MoO3 triangle. Attempts to obtain a pure Ag-containing h-MoO3 have failed so far; apparently the presence of Mn (beside Ag) stabilizes the h-MoO3 structure and the formula is more complex as compared with I. The phase diagram of the MnV2O6-AgVMoO6 system reveals great similarity to those containing Li and Na instead of Ag. All three diagrams involve a narrow lens-type solidus-liquidus gap at high Y and two peritectic meltings at lower Y, yielding, besides liquid, the high-temperature beta-MnAg polymorph and Mn2V2O7.

Here, we present neutron scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum in FeV2O4, a recent example of a ferrimagnetic spinel vanadate which is available in single-crystal form. We report the existence of two emergent magnon modes at low temperatures, which draw strong parallels with the closely related material, MnV2O4. We were able to reproduce the essential elements of both the magnetic ordering pattern and the dispersion of the inelastic modes with semiclassical spin-wave calculations, using a minimal model that implies a sizable single-ion anisotropy on the vanadium sublattice. Taking into account the direction of ordered spins, we associate this anisotropy with the large trigonal distortion of VO6 octahedra, previously observed via neutron powder diffractionmeasurements. We further report on the spin gap, which is an order of magnitude larger than that observed in MnV2O4. By looking at the overall temperature dependence, we were able to show that the gap magnitude is largely associated with the ferro-orbital order known to exist on the iron sublattice, but the contribution to the gap from the vanadium sublattice is in fact comparable to what is reported in the Mn compound. This reinforces the conclusion that the spin canting transition is associated with the ordering of vanadium orbitals in this system, and closer analysis indicates closely related physics underlying orbital transitions in FeV2O4 and MnV2O4.", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "89", "authors": ["MacDougall, GJ", "Brodsky, I", "Aczel, AA", "Garlea, VO", "Granroth, GE", "Christianson, AD", "Hong, T", "Zhou, HD", "Nagler, SE"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.224404", "issue": "22", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.89.134402", "pdflink": "http://librarians.aps.org/sitelicense.pdf", "pubDate": "APR 3 2014", "title": "Magnon spectra and strong spin-lattice coupling in magnetically frustrated MnB2O4 (B = Mn,V): Inelastic light-scattering studies", "abstract": "The ferrimagnetic spinels MnB2O4 (B = Mn,V) exhibit a similar series of closely spaced magnetic and structural phase transitions at low temperatures, reflecting both magnetic frustration and a strong coupling between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom.

As indicated by the X-ray diffraction peaks, the series of phenomena near the characteristic temperature T-1 are attributed to the happening of the micro-structural distortion, and the distortion implies the short-range orbital ordering state below T-1. This short-range oribtal ordering state is supported by the little upturn of the thermal conductance at T-1. As the temperature decreases, the systems enter a long-ranged collinear ferrimagnetic state at a lower temperature T-N. Moreover, the compounds decreases in thermal-electric power with the decrease of temperature and undergoes a p-type to n-type transition at the temperature T-pn. Through the quantitative theoretical analysis, both the decrease of the thermal power and the p-type to n-type transition are cooperatively induced by spin-orbit (SO) coupling and the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect.

The structure is comprised of manganese vanadate layers with 2,2'-bipyridine ligands coordinated to the Mn(II) cations. The water molecules coordinated to the manganese sites can be reversibly desorbed at similar to 190 degrees C with the formation of a new hybrid structure before then further decomposing to MnV2O6 upon heating to 300 degrees C. Notably, I undergoes a reversible structural transformation to Mn(bpy)V4O11(bpy) (H) under hydrothermal conditions. This structural transformation results from additional bpy-ligand coordination to 1/4 of the vanadium sites. Magnetic data indicate Mn(II) cations in both I and II are high spin (S = 5/2). The optical bandgap sizes of I and II were measured to be similar to 2.2 eV and similar to 1.6 eV, respectively, and that are calculated by DFT methods to arise primarily from Mn-to-bpy and Mn-to-V electronic transitions between the valence and conduction bands. Visible-light irradiation of II in aqueous solutions leads to photocatalytic activities for total water splitting at rates of similar to 92 mu mol H-2/1/2O(2) g(-1) h(-1) and similar to 21 mu mol H-2/1/2O(2) g(-1) h(-1) for H, with and without a 1 wt % Pt surface cocatalyst, respectively, but no measurable activity for I. Rates for only H-2 production using aqueous methanol solutions were significantly lower.

The experimental results revealed that the amount of NaOH is crucial in the formation of desirable products. The as-obtained nanocrystals were characterized by means of Xray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscope, selected area electron diffraction and electrochemical techniques. The as-prepared CuO are nanorods with 15 nm in diameter and 50 nm in length. The as-prepared Ni(OH)(2) nanocrystals have the flocculent feature and Co3O4 nanocrystals are composed of irregular particles. It should be pointed out that some traditional metal vanadates occur in these reaction systems, which were usually prepared by the solid-state routes. On the other hand, the electrochemical properties of the obtained products were studied in brief. Electrochemical performances of CuO, beta-Ni (OH)(2) and Co3O4 nanocrystals were measured with Li metal as the reference anode, which indicates their excellent capacities of Li-deposited for Li-ion batteries.

MnAg is able to incorporate an excess of MoO3 and form MnAg Phi = Mn(1-x-y)Phi(x)Ag(y)V(2-2x-y)Mo(2x+y)O(6) phases (Phi = cation vacancy in the original Mn/Ag site) belonging to the pseudoternary MnV2O6-AgVMoO6-MoO3 system. The system can be visualized as an equilateral triangle with X = 100x and Y = 100y coordinates along the MnV2O6-MoO3 and MnV2O6-AgVMoO6 arms, respectively, The limit of the existence of MnAg Phi is almost linear and extends between the X-Y points S-1 = (45,00) and S-2 = (12,88), As the ionic radii of dopants (Ag+/Mn2+), Mo6+/V5+) are larger than those of the mother cations, the lattice constants in both series-MnAg and almost saturated MnAg Phi (located along the S1S2 curve-rise systematically with an increase in Y. Behind the S1S2 curve, saturated MnAg Phi has been observed accompanied by \"hexagonal MoO3\" (h-MoO3), Y phase = Mn0.15V0.3Mo0.7O6, by (MoxV1-x)(2)O-5, and sometimes by orthorhombic MoO3 and MnMoO4. According to the literature, so-called h-MoO3 is a defective tunnel structure stabilized by the inserted free or hydrated L = K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+ ions, The formula of dry h-MoO3 is L0.13V0.13Mo0.87O3(I). Ag was believed to be too small to stabilize the peculiar h-MnO3. Despite that, we observed Ag-containing h-MoO3 in the field of the MnV2O6-AgVMoO6-MoO3 triangle. Attempts to obtain a pure Ag-containing h-MoO3 have failed so far; apparently the presence of Mn (beside Ag) stabilizes the h-MoO3 structure and the formula is more complex as compared with I. The phase diagram of the MnV2O6-AgVMoO6 system reveals great similarity to those containing Li and Na instead of Ag. All three diagrams involve a narrow lens-type solidus-liquidus gap at high Y and two peritectic meltings at lower Y, yielding, besides liquid, the high-temperature beta-MnAg polymorph and Mn2V2O7.

When a particular coordination model is assumed, the BVS method allows for oxidation states of metal ions in metalloproteins to be determined from metal-ligand bond distances measured using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. Thus, the BVS can be used to determine the compatibility between a given coordination model and a particular oxidation state. A new procedure for calculating r0 values on which BVS's are based is presented. This procedure allows for calculation of r0 values on heteroleptic complexes and was used to determine a new set of r0 distances using complexes that more closely model the active sites of interest.

We excluded patients with malignant disease and anti phospholipid syndrome. All patients were offered testing for heritable thrombophilia.\n\nFindings At 2 years, the cumulative recurrence rate in 570 patients was 11%. Incidence was lowest after surgery-related VTE (0%) and highest after unprecipitated VTE (19.4%) (p<0.001). 85% of patients were tested for heritable thrombophilic defects.

The oxidation was observed by the disappearance of thioanisole's ultraviolet absorption at 290 nm, by the change in the aromatic region of the H-1 NMR spectrum of the sulfides, and by changes in the complexes' V-51 NMR spectra. The amount of methyl phenyl sulfide oxidized in 3 h was 1000 equiv (per metal complex). The oxidation product is almost exclusively sulfoxide, with very little sulfone (less than 3% over a 3 h experiment) formed.

The ferric and ferrous species of P450 and P420 have been studied in both the presence and absence of excess camphor substrate. In ferric, camphor-bound, P450 (m(os)), the E. coli-expressed P450 is found to be spectroscopically indistinguishable from the native material. Although substrate binding to P450 is known to displace water molecules from the heme pocket, altering the coordination and spin state of the heme iron, the presence of camphor substrate in P420 samples is found to have essentially no effect on the Raman spectra of the heme in either the oxidized or reduced state. A detailed study of the Raman and absorption spectra of P450 and P420 reveals that the P420 heme is in equilibrium between a high-spin, five-coordinate (HS,5C) form and low-spin six-coordinate (LS,6C) form in both the ferric and ferrous oxidation states. In the ferric P420 state, H2O evidently remains as a heme ligand, while alterations of the protein tertiary structure lead to a significant reduction in affinity for Cys(357) thiolate binding to the heme iron. Ferrous P420 also consists of an equilibrium between HS,5C and LS,6C states, with the spectroscopic evidence indicating that H2O and histidine are the most likely axial ligands. The spectral characteristics of the CO complex of P42O are found to be almost identical to those of a low pH of Mb. Moreover, we find that the 10-ns transient Raman spectrum of the photolyzed P420 CO complex possesses a band at 220 cm-1, which is strong evidence in favor of histidine ligation in the CO-bound state. The equilibrium structure of ferrous P420 does not show this band, indicating that Fe-His bond formation is favored when the iron becomes more acidic upon CO binding. Raman spectra of stationary samples of the CO complex of P450 reveal nu(Fe-CO) peaks corresponding to both substrate-bound and substrate-free species and demonstrate that substrate dissociation is coupled to CO photolysis.

In all photolyzed species, Hb*(CO), Mb*(CO), and beta(4)*(CO), the iron-histidine out-of-plane mode (nu(Fe-His)), indicative of heme doming, achieves 90% of its full intensity in 1 ps. The frequency of this mode (223-228 cm(-1)) is shifted significantly relative to equilibrium deoxy-Hb (210-216 cm(-1)) in the T state, but not with respect to either equilibrium deoxy-Mb or deoxy-beta(4). A correlation between the +12 cm(-1) bandshift of nu(Fe-His) and the -2 cm(-1) shift of the electron density marker band (nu(4) at 1370 cm(-1)) relative to T-state deoxy-Hb is shown to hold on all time scales, including the sub-picosecond time scale. Photolyzed Hb*(CO) consists of R-state or weakly interacting tetramers on the picosecond time scale and is shown to have properties similar to those of photolyzed Mb*(CO) and beta(4)*(CO) on the picosecond time scale.

This reaction generates two intermediates called 607- and 580-nm forms, and we found that they show the same oxygen-isotope-sensitive RR bands as those of the intermediates in O-2 reduction by CcO. In transient absorption spectra obtained under single turnover conditions, the 607-nm form appeared as the primary intermediate and subsequently the 580-nm and resting forms, suggesting that H2O2 serves as an oxidant for the resting enzyme but as a reductant for both the 607- and 580-nm forms in the peroxide cycle. The rise rate of absorption at 607 nm was insensitive to the H2O/D2O exchange, but the decay was significantly slower in D2O than in H2O. With the microcirculating system, each intermediate was maintained at a constant level under steady-stale conditions by supplying H2O2 continuously. In the pH range between 7.4 and 10.0, the population of the 607-nm form decreased at higher pH and at higher concentrations of H2O2. The Fe=O stretching (nu(Fe=O)) frequencies of the oxo heme of the 607-nm form, observed at 804/769 cm(-1) for their (H2O2)-O-16/(H2O2)-O-18 derivatives, were unaltered in this pH range and exhibited a D2O/H2O shift even at pH 10.0. This indicates that the iron-bound oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to a distal residue in this pH range. When the 580-nm form is dominant under the nonsaturating level of H2O2, two other oxygen-isotope-sensitive Raman bands have been observed at 755/750 cm(-1) and 355/340 cm(-1) at neutral pH, but the former disappeared above pH 8.5 and the latter above pH 9.0 without significant changes of absorption spectra, suggesting the presence of two separate species in the name of the 580-nm form. However, under the saturating concentration of H2O2, these Raman bands were unaltered between pH 7.4 and 10.0. In contrast, in the absence of excess peroxide, no oxygen-isotope-sensitive RR bands were observed despite dominance of the 580-nm form. The disappearance of these Raman bands demonstrates the occurrence of oxygen exchange between the oxo heme and bulk water, whose rate surpasses the formation rate of the 580-nm form al alkaline pH and/or at low H2O2 concentration. Such an oxygen exchange did not take place in the 607-nm form. Under the identical experimental conditions for generating a particular steady slate, the exchange of H2O with D2O caused significant depopulation of the 580-nm form and concomitant increase of the 607-nm form. This was satisfactorily interpreted in terms of the difference in the decay rate of the 607-nm form between H2O and D2O. Thus, the reduction of the 607-nm form to the 580-nm form is likely to be a key step of the redox-linked proton pumping in the O-2 reduction.", "ISSN": "0006-2960", "pub": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "volume": "35", "authors": ["Proshlyakov, DA", "Ogura, T", "ShinzawaItoh, K", "Yoshikawa, S", "Kitagawa, T"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi952096t", "issue": "26", "pages": "8580-8586"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 15 1988", "title": "THE VANADIUM IRON PROTEIN OF VANADIUM NITROGENASE FROM AZOTOBACTER-CHROOCOCCUM CONTAINS AN IRON VANADIUM COFACTOR", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0264-6021", "pub": "BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL", "volume": "250", "authors": ["SMITH, BE", "EADY, RR", "LOWE, DJ", "GORMAL, C"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "299-302"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja00116a017", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 22 1995", "title": "CATALYTIC REDUCTION OF HYDRAZINE TO AMMONIA BY THE VFE3S4 CUBANES - FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF THE HETEROMETAL IN THE REDUCTION OF NITROGENASE SUBSTRATES AND POSSIBLE RELEVANCE TO THE VANADIUM NITROGENASES", "abstract": "The catalytic behavior of synthetic Fe/V/S clusters that structurally resemble the Fe/V/S site of nitrogenase is reported. The [(L)(L')(L'')VFe3S4Cl3](n-) clusters (L, L', L'' = DMF, n = 1; L = PEt(3), L', L'' = DMF, n = 1; L, L' = 2,2'-bipyridyl, L'' = DMF, n = 1) that contain the [VFe3S4](2-) cuboidal core are effective catalysts in the reduction of hydrazine (a nitrogenase substrate) to ammonia in the presence of cobaltocene and 2,6-lutidine hydrochloride as sources of electrons and protons, respectively. Reactivity studies show that V-coordinated terminal ligands have a profound effect on the relative rates of hydrazine reduction. Specifically, as the number of labile solvent molecules coordinated to the V atom decreases, the relative rate of hydrazine reduction decreases. The behavior also is observed with the [(HBpz3)VFe3S4Cl3](2-) cubane (L, L', L'' = hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate, n = 2), where all coordination sites on the V atom are ''blocked''. The latter shows no catalytic or stoichiometric hydrazine reduction and its structure has been determined. To investigate the role of the Fe sites in the [VFe3S4](2+) cubanes during catalysis, a series of cubanes [(DMF)(3)VFe(3)S(4)X(3)](-) (X = Cl-, Br-, or I-) was synthesized. Relative rates of hydrazine reduction with each catalyst were virtually identical, indicating little or no involvement of the Fe atoms during catalysis. The result's of this study strongly implicate the heterometal (V) as the site directly involved in the binding and activation of hydrazine. Additionally, reduction of phenylhydrazine to ammonia and aniline is observed in these systems. Importantly, the single cubane (Me(4)N)[(PhHNNH(2))(bpy)VFe3S4Cl3] has been synthesized, indicating the ability of a hydrazine-like substrate molecule to interact directly with the V atom.

For the dithionite-reduced Azotobacter vinelandii Mo-Fe protein, the dominant EXAFS Fourier transform peaks are assigned to Fe-S and Fe-Fe interactions at approximately 2.32 and 2.64 angstrom, as expected for Fe-S clusters. An additional Fe-Mo component at 2.73 angstrom is required to completely fit the EXAFS in the 1-3-angstrom region. In the 3-5-angstrom region, a 3.8-angstrom Fe-Fe component is identified, with an amplitude corresponding to almost one long Fe-Fe interaction, averaged over all of the iron in the sample. Features that can be explained as Fe-S and Fe-Fe interactions at 4.3 and 4.7 angstrom are also observed. A similar pattern of Fe interactions is observed for the reduced A. vinelandii V-Fe protein, except that the short Fe-Mo interaction is no longer required.

The dosage of Colostrinin was 100 mug on alternate days for three weeks followed by two weeks drug-free. This cycle was repeated three times for each phase. The primary outcome measures used were Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive portion (ADAS-cog) and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). Secondary outcome measures were Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); ADAS-non cognitive test (ADAS-non cog); and overall Patient Response. The main outcome measures were assessed at week 15 when active was compared with placebo but all parameters were evaluated at baseline, week 15 and week 30. Two separate statistical analyses were undertaken, a Full Sample Analysis (FSA) in which all missing values were replaced with the worst result observed and a Valid for Efficacy (VFE) analysis in which those patients who had serious protocol violations were excluded. This resulted in 14 patients being excluded from the VFE-analysis. The FSA analysis at week 15 showed a stabilizing effect of Colostrinin on cognitive function in ADAS-cog (p = 0.02) and on daily function in IADL (p = 0.02). The overall patient response was also in favour of the active (p = 0.03). Patients graded as mild on entry also showed a superior response of ADAS-cog compared with more advanced cases (p = 0.01).

Such domains exhibit a wide range of ligand binding parameters, yet they are all expected to feature an alpha-beta heme binding fold and a predominantly hydrophobic heme distal pocket without a distal histidine. We have compared, for the first time, the resonance Raman spectra of several heme-PASs: the heme-binding domains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL, Escherichia coli Dos, Acetobacter xylinum PDEA1, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Dos. In all cases, the nu(Fe-CO) and nu(C-O) values of the carbonmonoxy forms were consistent with coordination of the heme iron to histidine on the proximal side and binding of the CO without electrostatic interaction with the heme distal pocket. EcDos was unusual in having predominantly hexacoordinate heme iron in the deoxy and met forms. Despite an evident lack of CO interaction with the EcDos heme pocket, relatively low Fe-O-2 (562 cm(-1)) and N-O (1576 cm(-1)) stretching frequencies indicated that strong polar interactions with that heme distal pocket are possible for highly bent ligands such as O-2 or NO. None of the newly studied NO adducts exhibited evidence of the Fe-His rupture and pentacoordination previously noted for Sinorhizobium meliloti FixL. A low Fe-His stretching frequency, formerly interpreted as a strained Fe-His bond, and the slow association of O-2 with S. meliloti FixL failed to correlate with the newly studied proteins having low association rate or low equilibrium association constants for binding of O-2.

After their antipsychotic medications were tapered for 1 week, patients were randomly assigned to receive either risperidone 1 to 3 mg/day or olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/day for 8 weeks. Performance on the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Serial Verbal Learning Test (SVLT), TMT (Trail Making Test) Parts A and B, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and Verbal Fluency Examinations (VFE) was assessed at baseline and at end point.\n\nResults Patients in the risperidone group had improved scores on at least one test of attention, memory, executive function, and verbal fluency, and those in the olanzapine group had improved scores on at least one test of attention and memory function. Scores on the TMT Part B, WCST total errors (executive function domain), and the VFE improved significantly from baseline in the risperidone group but not in the olanzapine group. No significant differences in change scores between the two groups were found. Higher baseline scores on each test predicted more improvement at endpoint.\n\nConclusions Low doses of risperidone and olanzapine improve cognitive function in elderly patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Consistent with research in younger populations, these improvements occur in aspects of cognitive functioning related to functional outcome.

A new procedure for the preparation of molybdenum single cubanes is introduced by the reaction of recently reported [(Tp)MoS(S-4)](-) with FeCl2/NaSEt to afford [(Tp)MoFe3S4Cl3](-) (1, 75% yield). This procedure is more efficient that the existing multistep synthesis of single cubanes, which generally affords clusters of mirror symmetry. Also prepared were [(Tp)MoFe3S4L3](-) (L = EtS- (2), p-MeC6H4S-). Reduction of 1 with borohydride gives [(Tp)MoFe3S4Cl3](2-) (5, 67%). Owing to the nature of the heterometal ligand, all clusters have idealized trigonal symmetry, reflected in their H-1 NMR spectra. Trigonal structures are demonstrated by crystallography of (BU4N)[1,2], (Bu4N)(2)[5](MeCN)-Me-., and (Me4N)(2)[8,9]. The availability of 1 and 5 allows the first comparison of structures and Fe-57 isomer shifts of [MoFe3S4](3+,2+) in a constant ligand environment. Small increases in most bond distances indicate that an antibonding electron is added in the reduction of 1. Collective synthetic and electrochemical results from this and other studies demonstrate the existence of the series of oxidation states [VFe3S4](3+,2+) and [MoFe3S4](4+,3+,2+) whose relative stabilities within a given senes are strongly ligand dependent. Isomer shifts indicate that the reduction of 1 largely affects the Fe-3 subcluster and are consistent with the formal descriptions [MoFe3+ 2-Fe2+S4](3+) (1) and [MoFe3+Fe22+S4](2+) (5). Reaction of 1 with excess Li2S in acetonitrile affords the double cubane {[(Tp)MoFe3S4Cl2](2)(mu(2)-S)}(2-), whose sulfide-bridged structure is supported by two sequential reductions separated by 290 mV, in analogy with previously reported double cubanes of higher charge. Trigonally symmetric single cubanes eliminate isomers in the formation of double cubanes and other cluster structures, and may be of considerable value in the preparation of new types of M-Fe-S clusters.

We have observed an isotopic shift of 1.25 cm-1 in the 218-cm-1 mode of deoxyMb, which suggests a Fe-His mode assignment as previous isotopic labeling studies have indicated. The magnitude of this shift agrees with the calculated shift for a two-body oscillator involving the Fe and imidazole His(F8) masses. However, additional isotopic labeling studies, involving Fe-54/Fe-57, N-15p/N-14p, and H-2/H-1 cannot be explained quantitatively within this model. As a result, we explore some simple variations on the two-body oscillator and find that a model involving concerted motion of the iron and N(epsilon) of the histidine against the rest of the imidazole ring is more consistent with the entire body of experimental evidence. This model is overly simplistic, but suggests that contributions from internal modes of the His(F8) cannot be ignored. Earlier data on the site-directed Mb mutants His(F8)Tyr show that modes at approximately 250 cm-1 in metMb and MbCO (along with the 218 cm-1 of deoxyMb) disappear upon removal of the Fe-His bond, suggesting a nu(Fe-His) assignment. However, the resonance Raman spectra of MbCO at pH 3.9, metHb, HbCO, and HbO2 also lack the modes at approximately 250 cm-1 even though they are known to have intact Fe-His bonds. Furthermore, we do not observe any significant N-15His isotopic shifts in the modes at approximately 250 cm-1 or in any other modes of metMb and MbCO. Thus, the modes at approximately 250 cm-1 in metMb and MbCO cannot be assigned to any motion that involves the labeled His(F8) nitrogens. Instead, the data presented here suggests that the modes at approximately 250 cm-1 are structurally sensitive out-of-plane heme modes that are enhanced via interactions between the heme and His(F8). Moreover, there must be a subtle structural difference between the heme-His(F8) geometry of Mb and Hb that accounts for the Raman activity of the modes at approximately 250 cm-1 in metMb, MbCO, and MbO2 at pH 7 and the absence of these modes in the analogous Hb complexes.", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "113", "authors": ["WELLS, AV", "SAGE, JT", "MORIKIS, D", "CHAMPION, PM", "CHIU, ML", "SLIGAR, SG"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00025a034", "issue": "25", "pages": "9655-9660"}, {"DOI": "10.1063/1.1788656", "pdflink": "http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/jcp/121/14/1.1788656.pdf;jsessionid=18899w2berhu.x-aip-live-02?itemId=/content/aip/journal/jcp/121/14/10.1063/1.1788656&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/jcp", "pubDate": "OCT 8 2004", "title": "Periodic table of 3d-metal dimers and their ions", "abstract": "The ground states of the mixed 3d-metal dimers TiV, TiCr, TiMn, TiFe, TiCo, TiNi, TiCu, TiZn, VCr, VMn, VFe, VCo, VNi, VCu, VZn, CrMn, CrFe, CrCo, CrNi, CrCu, CrZn, MnFe, MnCo, MnNi, MnCu, MnZn, FeCo, FeNi, FeCu, FeZn, CoNi, CoCu, CoZn, NiCu, NiZn, and CuZn along with their singly negatively and positively charged ions are assigned based on the results of computations using density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation functional.

We observed that the inner core skeletal vibrations of cytochrome a, are the same for similar adducts of the bacterial ba(3) and mammalian aa(3), indicating similar spin and iron-porphyrin coordination properties resulting in comparable porphyrin core geometries. On the other hand, many of the vibrational frequencies associated with the formyl and vinyl peripheral substituents, and the outer pyrrole carbon atoms differ between the bovine and bacterial enzymes. Use of Fe-57 labeled ba(3) allows identification of two separate vFe-N(His) frequencies displayed by the fully reduced, unliganded cytochrome. These frequencies, occurring at 193 and 209 cm(-1), are ascribed to distinct protein conformers, which are best evidenced by the Fe-N(His) vibrations. This result is again in contrast to the bovine enzyme which has been shown by others to display a single Fe-N(His) stretching frequency at 214 cm(-1). The low-frequency Fe-a3(2+)-CN- vibrations of the three-electron and fully reduced cyano complexes of cytochrome ba(3) are identified by using N-15 and C-13 isotopomers of CN-. These spectral signatures are identical to those reported earlier for the one-electron-reduced cyanide adduct (cytochrome a(3) reduced), showing that the Fe-a3(2+)-CN- vibrational frequencies are independent of the redox states of the other three metal centers. Similarly, the Cu-B(2+) EPR signatures appear similar in both the one-electron- and three-electron-reduced cyanide adducts. On the other hand, the electronic absorption spectra of ferrous a(3)-CN- show systematic red-shifts of the alpha band as each of the other metal centers is reduced, and other, more subtle, differences in the electronic absorptions of the three-electron-reduced and four-electron-reduced cyanide adducts are revealed in the difference spectra. The relevance of these findings toward explaining the different cyanide binding and redox chemistry described herein and toward establishing the extent of structural analogy between the oxygen binding sites of the two proteins is discussed.", "ISSN": "0006-2960", "pub": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "volume": "33", "authors": ["OERTLING, WA", "SURERUS, KK", "EINARSDOTTIR, O", "FEE, JA", "DYER, RB", "WOODRUFF, WH"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00176a048", "issue": "10", "pages": "3128-3141"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/bi00073a014", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233860952896/bichaw-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 8 1993", "title": "TIME-RESOLVED RESONANCE RAMAN-STUDY ON THE BINDING OF CARBON-MONOXIDE TO RECOMBINANT HUMAN MYOGLOBIN AND ITS DISTAL HISTIDINE MUTANTS", "abstract": "Time-resolved resonance Raman (RR) spectra of the recombined species of photodissociated CO with recombinant human myoglobin (Mb) and several E7 mutants, in which distal His was replaced by Gly (H64G), Gln (H64Q), Ala (H64A), Ile (H641), Val (H64V), and Leu (H64L) through site-directed mutagenesis, were observed in the time range -20 ns to 1 ms following photolysis. The Fe-CO stretching (nu(Fe-CO)) RR band was observed successfully with pulse excitation when the laser power was greatly reduced. H64H, H64G, and H64Q gave the nu(Fe-CO) band at 505-5 10 cm-1 in their stationary states. In their recovery processes 1-100 mus after photodissociation, a broad transient band was observed at slightly lower frequencies than those of their equilibrium structures for H64G and H64Q, but a transient nu(Fe-CO) band corresponding to the so-called ''open'' form was not identified around 490 cm-1 for any of the three species. A second group, H64A, H641, H64V, and H64L, gave the main nu(Fe-CO) band at 490-495 cm-1 with a shoulder around 510 cm-1 (except for H64L) in the stationary state and exhibited a much faster recovery than the first group. These latter four species gave a broad transient band around 492-500 cm-1 in the time range of 100-1000 ns, while the approximately 510 cm-1 shoulder appeared much later. The equilibrium relative intensity of the two bands was attained at 500 mus, suggesting that the interconversion between the two forms is slower than 100 mus. For all MbCO examined here, the recovery, determined from the area intensity of the P(Fe-CO) band, exhibited two phases irrespective of the presence of one or two nu(Fe-CO) bands. The nu(Fe-CO) frequencies could be correlated with the hydropathy index of the E7 residue but not with its physical size. It is inferred that the more hydrophobic environment around CO reduces the polarization of CO and lowers the nu(Fe-CO) frequency to approximately 490 cm-1 on the one hand and stabilizes the intermediate state called the protein-separated pair on the other. The latter increases the contribution of recombination from this intermediate, resulting in faster recombination of CO.", "ISSN": "0006-2960", "pub": "BIOCHEMISTRY", "volume": "32", "authors": ["SAKAN, Y", "OGURA, T", "KITAGAWA, T", "FRAUNFELTER, FA", "MATTERA, R", "IKEDASAITO, M"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00073a014", "issue": "22", "pages": "5815-5824"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1966", "title": "THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND MODEL EXPERIMENTS ON VALIDITY OF INDICATOR DILUTION METHODS FOR MEASUREMENTS OF VARIABLE FLOW", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0009-7330", "pub": "CIRCULATION RESEARCH", "volume": "18", "authors": ["CROPP, GJA", "BURTON, AC"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "26-&"}, {"DOI": "10.1021/ja00308a013", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1233861031697/jacsat-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "1985", "title": "HETERONUCLEAR TRANSITION-METAL CLUSTER IONS IN THE GAS-PHASE - PHOTODISSOCIATION AND REACTIVITY OF VFE+", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "0002-7863", "pub": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY", "volume": "107", "authors": ["HETTICH, RL", "FREISER, BS"], "DOIlink": "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00308a013", "issue": "22", "pages": "6222-6226"}, {"DOI": "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.t01-1-00789.x", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "MAR 15 1997", "title": "Comparative biochemical characterization of the iron-only nitrogenase and the molybdenum nitrogenase from Rhodobacter capsulatus", "abstract": "The component proteins of the iron-only nitrogenase were isolated from Rhodobacter capsulatus (Delta nifHDK, Delta modABCD strain) and purified in a one-day procedure that included only one column-chromatography step (DEAE-Sephacel).

The highest specific activities, which were achieved at an Rc2(Fe)/Rc1(Fe) molar ratio of 40:1, were 260 (C2H4 from C2H2), 350 (NH3 formation), and 2400 (H-2 evolution) nmol product formed . min(-1). mg protein(-1).

The use of standard data transformations is a common alternative but may not provide enough flexibility for some cases.  The use of weighted regression with weights estimated from replicates is generally unreliable for reasonable sample sizes.  However, when the error variance changes systematically with the mean response or other variables, generalized least squares (GLS) and variance function estimation (VFE) methods can be used.  The GLS-VFE approach allows the experimenter to specify a model for the systematic change in variance, estimate unknown parameters, and to use this information to provide more efficient estimates of regression parameters.  In this tutorial, GLS-VFE methods are introduced and described in the context of regression and calibration.

Among all, the quintet FeO2+ moiety is particularly widespread and active: aliphatic C-H bonds undergo hydroxylation easily through a H-abstraction/O-rebound mechanism. The high electrophilicity of quintet FeO2+ originates from its electronic structure: a low lying vacant sigma* can accept electronic density from the aliphatic C-H bond. What singles out this quintet FeO2+? Its lowest vacant acceptor orbital energy? its shape (sigma* vs pi*)? or has its biological importance more simply arisen from the high iron abundance? To answer those questions, we have performed density-functional theory calculations to study systematically the methane-to-methanol reaction catalyzed by MO(H2O)(p)(2+) complexes P (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, p = 5 and M = Ni, Cu, p = 4) in gas phase. We show here that the lower the MO2+ acceptor orbital lies in energy, the lower the H-abstraction barrier is in general. However, a sigma* acceptor orbital is much more efficient than a pi* acceptor orbital for a given energy.

Hence, any factor that affects soil microbial biomass, activity and populations would necessarily affect soil quality and sustainability. Presently, a staggering number of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) employed for industrial and environmental applications or formed as by-products of human activity are finding their way into soils. Common ENPs include the metal ENPs (elemental Ag, Au, Fe etc.), fullerenes (grouping Buckminster fullerenes, CNTs, nanocones etc.), metal oxides (TiO2, CuO, FeO2, ZnO, Al2O3, SiO2 etc.), complex compounds (Co-Zn-Fe oxide), quantum dots often coated with a polymer e.g. cadmium-selenide (CdSe) and organic polymers (dendrimers, polystyrene, etc.). The antimicrobial activity of these ENPs has been extensively studied with human pathogenic bacteria. Similarly, studies also exist on the affect of ENPs on beneficial microbes in vitro under controlled conditions. But very little information is available on how these ENPs affect microbial communities in soil under field conditions. The few published literature does suggest that among the ENPs, fullerenes and their derivatives are less toxic, while small size metal and metal oxide ENPs are detrimental to soil microbial communities. However, under field conditions, soil organic matter and related components like humic and fulvic acids could possibly negate the toxic effects of these ENPs through various mechanisms. Also, the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to such perturbations cannot be discounted. The paper also stresses the need for more information on interaction of ENPs with soil microorganisms under field conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The ultimate product of these processes is the known Nb(V) oxo compound Cp'Nb-2(=O)(Cl) (2), which obviously arises by way of a multistep mechanism. We have investigated the mechanism of the autoxidation using a series of alternate syntheses and/or modified reaction conditions and provide direct evidence for a sequence involving the sequential formation of the eta(2)-peroxide Cp'Nb-2(O-2)Cl, its reaction with excess 1 to generate 2, the subsequent conproportionation of 2 and 1 to make the mu-oxo compound [Cp'2NbCl](2)(O) (3), and the further oxidation of this compound to 2. The reaction of 1 and 2 is postulated to involve the intermediacy of a peroxide-bridged system [Cp'2NbCl](2)(O-2) (5); although this compound has not been observed directly, attempted synthesis of 5 using superoxide lead directly to 3. These individual reactions are kinetically competent, and the results thus constitute a four-step mechanism for the production of 3. In addition, studies on the reactions of 3 with PMePh(2) illustrate that 3 disproportionates to 2 and 1 and that the latter is trapped rapidly. Conversely, reaction of 3 with additional dioxygen does not require dissociation and may proceed via a direct redox pathway.

Ventilatory frequency, tidal volume and oxygen extraction 'efficiency' (EO2 = (V) over dot(O2)/FEO2 . (V) overdot(I))were measured at each age and temperarure. Mean breathing frequency at 4 days old was 2.56 breaths per second, decreasing to 1.99 at 20 days old. There was insignificant modification of breathing frequency with temperature. Four day old rat pups at 28 degrees C had mass specific tidal volumes of 0.017 ml/g, 142% of the value at 36 degrees C (0.012 ml/g). Twenty day old pups at 28 degrees C had mass specific tidal volumes of 0.027 ml/g, also 142% of the thermoneutral value (0.019 ml/g at 32 degrees C). At all ages, increases in tidal volumes were similar and increases in tidal volume were the only response to increased metabolic demand. Oxygen extraction 'efficiency' was about half that previously observed in adult rodents. These observations of ventilation during a cold challenge suggest that although structural development is not complete until much later, functional development is sufficient, either at birth or shortly thereafter.

Quantum chemical multi-reference configuration interaction calculations (MRCISD) of structures and harmonic frequencies show that these bands are due to two different isomers, an inserted dioxo complex with Fe in the +V oxidation state and a side-on superoxo complex with Fe in the +II oxidation state. These two are separated by a substantial barrier, 53 kJ/mol, whereas the third isomer, an end-on complex between Fe+ and an O-2 molecule, is easily converted into the side-on complex. For all three isomers, states of different spin multiplicity have been considered. Our best energies are computed at the MRCISD+Q level, including corrections for complete active space and basis set extension, core-valence correlation, relativistic effects, and zero-point vibrational energy.

The present study focuses on the effects of the orientations of His64 and His93 on the chemical bonding of the FeO2 core in the ground (S = 0) state. The orientation of binding O-2 molecule as well as axial His93 drastically changes during the optimization when using the BS method. In order to make this point clear, the spin contamination error involved in the BS singlet state is removed from both the energy and its gradient by an approximate spin-projection (AP) method. In most cases, the attempt to correct the geometry results in failure, indicating the Heisenberg model cannot be always applicable to this system. Judging from the difference in the structural parameters between the BS and corrected BS (AP) structure, the spin contamination error on the geometry of the FeO2 core is small. Based on these results, we suggest that the geometry optimization using a small model complex such as FeO2(Im)(Por) (Im, imidazole; Por, porphyrin) provides a local minima, in which pi bond of Fe-O-2 core is artificially stabilized by rotating the O-2 molecule.

Earlier it had been found that at room temperature five-coordinated Fe2+ and Fe3+ species form pairs by sharing a d electron. leading to the formation of a Fe-2,Fe-5+ fluctuating valence state [Phys. Rev. B 60 (1999) 15,25 1]. At T-V, a Verwey-type transition occur-red, signifying the charge separation of the Fe-2,Fe-5+ fluctuating valence state into high-spin Fe2+ and Fe3+. Moreover, related to the Verwey-tvpe transition a negative magnetoresistance peak with a magnitude of a few percent was observed [Appl. Phys. Lett. 77 (2000) 1683]. The position of the peak was found to correspond to the jumps seen in the susceptibility and resistivity vs. temperature curves. For the present samples, it is found that the value of T-V is severely decreased upon increasing the Ca concentration, as seen by susceptibility and magnetoresistivity measurements. Introduction of excess oxygen leads to a less severe decrease of the transition temperature. The observed behavior of T-V was reproduced by a simple model based on combinatorial-entropy calculations.

These results show that the adiabatic electron-phonon coupling can influence the phonon thermodynamics at temperatures exceeding 1000 K.", "ISSN": "0031-9007", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS", "volume": "101", "authors": ["Delaire, O", "Lucas, MS", "Munoz, JA", "Kresch, M", "Fultz, B"], "DOIlink": "http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.105504", "issue": "10", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "1951", "title": "THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF V3CO\n", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGICAL ENGINEERS", "volume": "191", "authors": ["DUWEZ, P"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "7", "pages": "564-564"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "VCo3", "bandgap": "0", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/Search.do?product=UA&SID=%221BRwZkZv2kc1GsVxPm2%22&search_mode=GeneralSearch&prID=8aa3983e-7358-4596-b286-93600e5fbca7", "numResults": 22, "crystalsystem": "hexagonal", "spacegroup": "194, 191"}, [{"DOI": "10.1107/S0108768191000903", "pdflink": "http://journals.iucr.org/b/issues/1991/04/00/du0255/du0255.pdf", "pubDate": "AUG 1 1991", "title": "INORGANIC STRUCTURE TYPES WITH REVISED SPACE-GROUPS .1.", "abstract": "Standardized data sets in space groups which consider all symmetry elements in the structure are given for the following structure types, originally reported in space groups with lower symmetry or with larger unit cells (numbers of original and new space group are indicated within parentheses):  Ag3TlTe2 (53 --> 65), Au3Cd (107 --> 139), Ca3Hg (217 --> 221, 1/4 volume of primitive cell), CeZn3 (62 --> 63), CoGe2 (41 --> 64), CuAu phase I (123 --> 123, 1/2 cell volume), Cu10Sb3 (147 --> 176), GaSe 2H epsilon (174 --> 187), InSe II (10 --> 12), LaB2C2 (112 --> 131), alpha-Li3BN2 (94 --> 136), Li6.45Mn3As4 (16 --> 49 or 67), Li7Pb2 (150 --> 164), LiPd2 (10 --> 10, 1/2 cell volume), LiRh (174 --> 187), MgAu3-x (38 --> 63), Mg3In (146 --> 166), Mn2AlB2 (21 --> 65), Mn3As (59 --> 63), MnBi QHT (17 --> 51), Mn(Bi0.85Sb0.15) (17 --> 51), Na2HgO2 (97 --> 139), Na1-xTiS2 (146 --> 160), NbD0.95 (48 --> 66), theta-Ni2Si (176 or 182 --> 194), Pd4-xTe (216 --> 227), PtSn4 (41 --> 68), SrFe2S4 (117 --> 125), Tb2(Fe0.832Al0.168)17 (177 --> 191), Ti3Al2N2 (159 --> 186), VAu2 (38 --> 63), V6C5 (144 --> 151), VCo3 LT (187 --> 194), gamma-V4D3 (27 --> 49), WAl5 (173 --> 182), delta-Yb2S3 (4 --> 11), Zr4Al3 (174 --> 191).

A survey of AMPV infection in 122 turkey and 48 broiler farms, in a highly densely populated area of Northern Italy, performed from January 2011 to February 2013, is reported. AMPV positive samples were detected using or RT-nested PCR or qRT-PCR both able to detect and differentiate AMPV subtype A and B. All samples but one resulted positive for AMPV subtype B confirming the high prevalence of this subtype in Italy.

Turkeys were all vaccinated at 1 day of age in the hatchery. The reasons for vaccine failure could be field virus changes in key antigenic regions that allow replication and leading to disease in well vaccinated birds. Our study revealed that VCO3 vaccine strain can be detected in turkeys up to many weeks after vaccination, with a high prevalence in the first weeks after hatch. This confirmed the pattern seen previously for subtype A and B live vaccine which has been shown to persist on farm for 4-5 weeks. Uniquely in this study, apparently vaccine derived strains were observed in older turkeys of up to 84 days of age.

Nonetheless, unstable attenuation was previously demonstrated in an AMPV subtype A vaccine. Until now this had not been investigated in subtype B vaccines due to lack of any similar availability of a vaccine progenitor or its sequence. The publication of the full genome sequence for the VCO3 vaccine progenitor facilitated a conclusive investigation of two AMPVs isolated from poults on a farm which had been vaccinated with VCO3 derived vaccine. Full genome sequencing of the isolates and their comparison to sequences of the vaccine and its progenitor, confirmed their vaccine origin. After determining the absence of extraneous infectious agents, one of these virus isolates was inoculated into 1-day-old turkeys in disease secure isolators and shown to cause disease with a severity similar to that caused by virulent field virus. This suggests that instability in live AMPV vaccines may be generalized and highlights the need for availability of vaccine progenitor sequences for the field assessment of all live viral vaccines.

In this work, metal concentrations were evaluated in soil and vegetable samples from several regions, where different agricultural techniques were employed. Si, Zr, Ce, Th, Sc and Pb identified in the soil samples were not biologically available. Ga, Ge, As and Br identified in the tubercles indicate that spray pesticide used on the vegetable leaves was absorbed by them. Th-232 and U-238 present in the soil were not absorbed by the vegetables. The airborne particles from anthropogenic sources (as CFn, VCn) were absorbed by the vegetables. Compounds from mineral sources present in soil as V+, VCO3, HPO4, Cr+, CrOH+, Mn+, FeH+, Fe(OH)(n) and in the bioorganic compounds as N+, Ca(CN)(n)(+) and CnH+ were identified in vegetables. The metal absorption by the vegetables is not dependent of the metal concentration in soil. Different tubercles cultivated in the same soil show similar metal absorption. The exogenous contributions such as the elements present in water irrigation, pesticides, fertilizers and airborne particles deposited on leaves can be absorbed by vegetables. The absorption by the roots depends on the chemical compound of the elements. The use of pesticide sprays and air pollution can cause more contamination in the vegetables than in soil. The use of this methodology allows the identification of possible sources of metals in soils and in vegetables and the metal speciation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

While in general disease is effectively controlled by live vaccines, reversion to virulence of those vaccines has been demonstrated on several occasions. Consensus sequence mutations involved in the process have been identified in more than one instance. In one previous subtype A aMPV candidate vaccine study, small subpopulations were implicated. In the current study, the presence of subpopulations in a subtype B vaccine was investigated by deep sequencing. Of the 19 positions where vaccine (strain VCO3/50) and progenitor (strain VCO3/60616) consensus sequences differed, subpopulations were found to have sequence matching progenitor sequence in 4 positions. However none of these mutations occurred in a virulent revertant of that vaccine, thereby demonstrating that the majority progenitor virus population had not survived the attenuation process, hence was not obviously involved in any return to virulence. However within the vaccine, a single nucleotide variation was found which agreed with consensus sequence of a derived virulent revertant virus, hence this and other undetected, potentially virulent subpopulations, can be involved in reversion. Much deeper sequencing of progenitor, vaccine and revertant may clarify whether problematic virulent subpopulations are present and therefore whether these need to be routinely removed during aMPV vaccine preparation prior to registration and release.

The decreased stability of the L1(2) structure for these compounds with increasing Co/Fe ratio can be attributed to the occupation of electronic e(g) states that reduce the covalent interaction between Co(Fe) atoms.", "ISSN": "0925-8388", "pub": "JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS", "volume": "219", "authors": ["WOLF, W", "HERZIG, P", "NECKEL, A"], "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0925838894050031", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "299-302"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V2Co3O8", "bandgap": "1.741", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%221C5G3xxvw7QBzVRWIlJ%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "orthorhombic", "spacegroup": "64"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V3Co5O16", "bandgap": "0", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%221FXOixai6p81ZkquOVQ%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "monoclinic", "spacegroup": "8"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V2Co2O7", "bandgap": "1.8291", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%223EbJB6PiWFvmxmjChKZ%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "monoclinic", "spacegroup": "14"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V5CoO15", "bandgap": "0.613", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%221A6bh4hjVCMydvZAzrA%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "monoclinic", "spacegroup": "5"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V2CoO6", "bandgap": "1.4907, 2.0888, 2.0122, 1.5745", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%223A8fy466rGYE5Ft7lVd%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "triclinic, monoclinic", "spacegroup": "1, 15, 12"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V5CoO12", "bandgap": "0.0448", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%222F4zjtTTuPESiv8h3gg%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "monoclinic", "spacegroup": "5"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V2CoO4", "bandgap": "0", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?SID=%222Fp1F4GyfltmjnLrVnu%22&product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch&errorQid=1", "numResults": 0, "crystalsystem": "cubic", "spacegroup": "227"}, [{"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "N/A", "title": "N/A", "abstract": "N/A", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "N/A", "volume": "N/A", "authors": "N/A", "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "N/A", "pages": "N/A"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "VCoO4", "bandgap": "0.2601, 0.6005, 0.3679", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/Search.do?product=UA&SID=%222DkKhNfNfhzDUDEXq4e%22&search_mode=GeneralSearch&prID=92a9c9f7-201c-4002-93a9-694d98a26cfd", "numResults": 1, "crystalsystem": "orthorhombic", "spacegroup": "62, 63, 74"}, [{"DOI": "10.1021/jz3008276", "pdflink": "http://pubs.acs.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1258124831903/jpclcd-eab.pdf", "pubDate": "SEP 6 2012", "title": "Gas-Phase Neutral Binary Oxide Clusters: Distribution, Structure, and Reactivity toward CO", "abstract": "Neutral binary (vanadium-cobalt) oxide clusters are generated and detected in the gas phase for the first time.

The basic concept of the Brewer-Engel valence-bond theory, that relates the electronic state of highest multiplicity that corresponds to the electronic configuration of lowest energy level or the structure of atoms, with the corresponding phase structure in both individual metallic and multicomponent intermetallic systems, is also given.  On the basis of the Brewer intermetallic bonding model as a generalized Lewis acid-base reaction, it is pointed out that, whenever metals of the left half of the transition series, having empty or half-filled vacant d-orbitals, are alloyed with metals of the right half of the transition series, having internally paired d-electrons not available for bonding in the pure metal, that proceeds with definite charge transfer, there arises a well-pronounced synergism in electrocatalysis for the HER, that often exceeds the individual catalytic effects of the precious metals by themselves or in combination (the synergism condition), and approaches reversible behavior within a wide range of current density.  Brewer intermetallic phases of hypo-hyper-d-electronic transition metals have been theoretically considered and practically investigated across the corresponding phase diagrams as electrocatalysts for the HER, and their activity explained on the basis of the d-d electronic correlations.  It is inferred that the maximum electrocatalytic activity extends to the composite d-metal catalysts of improved d-orbital overlap in intermetallic phases of highest symmetry and minimal enropy, such as Laves phases, and A15 or Cr3Si types, such as MoCo3, WNi3, VNi3, HfPd3, TiPt3, WFe3, ZrPt3, and LaNi5, that the Brewer theory for intermetallic bonding predicts for the most stable systems.", "ISSN": "0018-1536", "pub": "HIGH TEMPERATURE SCIENCE", "volume": "30", "authors": ["JAKSIC, MM"], "DOIlink": "N/A", "issue": "1", "pages": "19-50"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.146", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838813002090/pdfft?md5=e0c1ed5a3bdefac44312bd8bbb7932df&pid=1-s2.0-S0925838813002090-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 25 2013", "title": "Synergetic effects in electrochemical properties of ZrVxNi4.5-x (x=0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) metal hydride alloys", "abstract": "The structure, gaseous storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of ZrVxNi4.5-x (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) metal hydride alloys were studied. As the V-content in the alloy increased, the main phase shifted from ZrNi5/cubic Zr2Ni7 to ZrNi5/monoclinic Zr2Ni7/ZrNi9 and then to monoclinic Zr2Ni7 only. Other secondary phases, such as ZrNi, Zr3Ni5, VNi2 and VNi3, were also observed. The microstructures of the alloys with relatively higher V-content (x >= 0.3) were similar: 70% monoclinic Zr2Ni7 and 30% VNi2. Maximum hydrogen storage capacities measured in the gaseous phase study were low (<0.05 H/M) and decreased with the increase in V-content due to the increase in equilibrium hydrogen pressure. However, the equivalent hydrogen storage capacities converted from the electrochemical discharge capacities that were measured in the half-cell configuration were 5-15 times higher. The largest discharge capacity measured, 177 mA h g(-1), was observed from the alloy with the highest V-content (ZrV0.5Ni4.0). The phenomenon of the electrochemical capacity being larger than its corresponding maximum gaseous phase storage capacity was attributed to the decrease in equivalent hydrogen pressure in the electrochemical environment. Two hypotheses were proposed for the lowering in equilibrium hydrogen pressure: first, the creation of an activated surface in KOH and secondly, the synergetic effect from neighboring secondary phases. Although the discharge capacity and surface catalytic capability could be improved through further composition optimization (done with the incorporation of other modifying elements), the bulk hydrogen diffusion coefficients measured from the ZrVxNi4.5-x system were the highest among all the available metal hydride alloys in rechargeable nickel/metal hydride battery applications. The improvement in bulk hydrogen diffusion coefficient makes ZrVxNi4.5-x system attractive for applications requiring extremely high power density, such as hybrid electric vehicles.

To understand the mechanism by which VND7 regulates xylem vessel differentiation, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with VND7 and identified cDNAs encoding two NAC domain proteins, VND-INTERACTING1 (VNI1) and VNI2. Binding assays demonstrated that VNI2 effectively interacts with VND7 and the VND family proteins, VND1-5, as well as with other NAC domain proteins at lower affinity. VNI2 is expressed in both xylem and phloem cells in roots and inflorescence stems. The expression of VNI2 overlaps with that of VND7 in elongating vessel precursors in roots. VNI2 contains a predicted PEST motif and a C-terminally truncated VNI2 protein, which lacks part of the PEST motif, is more stable than full-length VNI2. Transient reporter assays showed that VNI2 is a transcriptional repressor and can repress the expression of vessel-specific genes regulated by VND7. Expression of C-terminally truncated VNI2 under the control of the VND7 promoter inhibited the normal development of xylem vessels in roots and aerial organs.

Accumulating evidence in recent years supports that plant responsiveness to abiotic stress is intimately related with leaf longevity. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling crosstalks and regulatory schemes are yet unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive NAC transcription factor VND-INTERACTING2 (VNI2) integrates ABA-mediated abiotic stress signals into leaf aging by regulating a subset of COLD-REGULATED (COR) and RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION (RD) genes. The VNI2 gene was induced by high salinity in an ABA-dependent manner. In addition, spatial and temporal expression patterns of the VNI2 gene are correlated with leaf aging and senescence. Accordingly, leaf aging was delayed in transgenic plants overexpressing the VNI2 gene but significantly accelerated in a VNI2-deficient mutant. The VNI2 transcription factor regulates the COR and RD genes by binding directly to their promoters. Notably, transgenic plants overexpressing the COR or RD genes exhibited prolonged leaf longevity.

In this study, two genes (BnNAC2 and BnNAC5) encoding the putative NAC transcription factors were identified in Brassica napus. Sequence analysis revealed that the deduced BnNAC proteins contain conserved N-terminal region (NAC domain) and highly divergent C-terminal domain. Yeast transactivation analysis showed that BnNAC2 could activate reporter gene expression, suggesting that BnNAC2 functions as a transcriptional activator. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that BnNAC2 was preferentially expressed in flowers, whereas BnNAC5 mRNAs accumulated at the highest level in stems. Further experimental results indicated that the two genes are high-salinity-, drought- and abscisic acid (ABA)-induced. Overexpression of BnNAC2 and BnNAC5 genes in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) remarkably inhibited the growth rate of the host cells, and enhanced the cells sensitive to high-salinity and osmotic stresses. Complementation test indicated that BnNAC5 could recover the defects such as salt-hypersensitivity and accelerated-leaf senescence of vni2 T-DNA insertion mutant. Several stress-responsive genes including COR15A and RD29A were enhanced in the complemented plants.

A number of transcription factors (TFs) modulate SAG expression to promote or delay senescence. Here we show that NAC016, the previously uncharacterized senescence-associated NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (senNAC) TF in Arabidopsis thaliana, promotes senescence. Leaves of nac016 mutants remained green under senescence-inducing conditions, and leaves of NAC016-overexpressing (NAC016-OX) plants senesced early. Under dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions, nac016 mutants had low ion leakage, and retained the proper balance of photosystem proteins and normal grana thylakoid shape much longer than wild-type plants, suggesting that nac016 acts as a functional stay-green type senescence mutant. Under DIS conditions, SAGs (NYC1, PPH, SGR1/NYE1 and WRKY22), including senNACs (JUB1, NAP, ORE1, ORS1 and VNI2), were down-regulated in nac016 mutants and up-regulated in NAC016-OX plants. In addition to its role in senescence, NAC016 also affects abiotic stress. Under salt and oxidative stress conditions, NAC016 expression rapidly increased in developing leaves, possibly to promote senescence. Indeed, under the stress conditions, nac016 mutants stayed green and NAC016-OX plants senesced rapidly. To identify direct targets of the NAC016 TF in the regulation of leaf senescence, we conducted yeast one-hybrid assays, which strongly suggested that NAC016 binds to the promoters of NAP and ORS1. Based on these results, we propose that NAC016 regulatory mechanisms promoting leaf senescence exhibit cross-talk with the salt and oxidative stress-responsive signaling pathways.", "ISSN": "0032-0781", "pub": "PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY", "volume": "54", "authors": ["Kim, YS", "Sakuraba, Y", "Han, SH", "Yoo, SC", "Paek, NC"], "DOIlink": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pct113", "issue": "10", "pages": "1660-1672"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.146", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838813002090/pdfft?md5=e0c1ed5a3bdefac44312bd8bbb7932df&pid=1-s2.0-S0925838813002090-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAY 25 2013", "title": "Synergetic effects in electrochemical properties of ZrVxNi4.5-x (x=0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) metal hydride alloys", "abstract": "The structure, gaseous storage, and electrochemical properties of a series of ZrVxNi4.5-x (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) metal hydride alloys were studied. As the V-content in the alloy increased, the main phase shifted from ZrNi5/cubic Zr2Ni7 to ZrNi5/monoclinic Zr2Ni7/ZrNi9 and then to monoclinic Zr2Ni7 only. Other secondary phases, such as ZrNi, Zr3Ni5, VNi2 and VNi3, were also observed. The microstructures of the alloys with relatively higher V-content (x >= 0.3) were similar: 70% monoclinic Zr2Ni7 and 30% VNi2. Maximum hydrogen storage capacities measured in the gaseous phase study were low (<0.05 H/M) and decreased with the increase in V-content due to the increase in equilibrium hydrogen pressure. However, the equivalent hydrogen storage capacities converted from the electrochemical discharge capacities that were measured in the half-cell configuration were 5-15 times higher. The largest discharge capacity measured, 177 mA h g(-1), was observed from the alloy with the highest V-content (ZrV0.5Ni4.0). The phenomenon of the electrochemical capacity being larger than its corresponding maximum gaseous phase storage capacity was attributed to the decrease in equivalent hydrogen pressure in the electrochemical environment. Two hypotheses were proposed for the lowering in equilibrium hydrogen pressure: first, the creation of an activated surface in KOH and secondly, the synergetic effect from neighboring secondary phases. Although the discharge capacity and surface catalytic capability could be improved through further composition optimization (done with the incorporation of other modifying elements), the bulk hydrogen diffusion coefficients measured from the ZrVxNi4.5-x system were the highest among all the available metal hydride alloys in rechargeable nickel/metal hydride battery applications. The improvement in bulk hydrogen diffusion coefficient makes ZrVxNi4.5-x system attractive for applications requiring extremely high power density, such as hybrid electric vehicles.

To date, none of the ramie NAC (BnNAC) genes had been identified, even though ramie is one of the most important natural fiber crops. In order to mine the BnNAC TFs and identify their potential function, the search for BnNAC genes against two pools of unigenes de novo assembled from the RNA-seq in our two previous studies was performed, and a total of 32 full-length BnNAC genes were identified in this study. Forty-seven function-known NAC proteins published in other species, in concert with these 32 BnNAC proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, and the result showed that all the 79 NAC proteins can be divided into eight groups (NAC-I-VIII). Among the 32 BnNAC genes, 24, 2, and 1 gene showed higher expression in stem xylem, leaf, and flower, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of 14, 11 and 4 BnNAC genes was regulated by drought, cadmium stress, and infection by root lesion nematode, respectively. Interestingly, there were five BnNAC TFs which showed high homology with the NAC TFs of other species involved in regulating the secondary wall synthesis, and their expressions were not regulated by drought and cadmium stress. These results suggested that the BnNAC family might have a functional diversity.

This metabolic adjustment is critical for prevention of diverse cellular damage and thus for reproductive success and offspring production, particularly under environmental stress conditions. However, it is largely unknown how age-dependent resistance to cellular damages is established and how it is influenced by environmental stress signals during senescing process. We found that the VNI2 (VND-INTERACTING 2) transcription factor, which belongs to the NAC (NAM/ATAF1, 2/CUC2) transcription factor family, plays a role in the age-dependent induction of stress resistance. The VNI2 transcription factor is transcriptionally induced during senescing process and regulates COR/RD genes by binding directly to their promoters. The COR/RD proteins play a role in the protection from diverse cellular damages during senescing process. Notably, the transcriptional activation activity of VNI2 is further elevated under high salinity. These results indicate that plants increase environmental stress resistance by inducing the VNI2 gene to assure their reproductive success, supporting signaling crosstalk between stress resistance response and senescing process.\n", "ISSN": "1559-2324", "pub": "Plant signaling & behavior", "volume": "6", "authors": ["Seo, Pil Joon", "Park, Chung-Mo"], "DOIlink": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/psb.6.10.17003", "issue": "10", "pages": "1564-6"}]], [{"numQueries": 1, "material": "V3Ni", "bandgap": "0", "searchURL": "http://apps.webofknowledge.com/Search.do?product=UA&SID=%222FZp8qXXjtGTqn3ytVt%22&search_mode=GeneralSearch&prID=aef5f22c-c7b5-408c-9c2d-12da161c257b", "numResults": 3, "crystalsystem": "cubic", "spacegroup": "223"}, [{"DOI": "10.1016/S0925-8388(99)00043-2", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838899000432/pdfft?md5=1defe202aa49eb40bcdd02f248134393&pid=1-s2.0-S0925838899000432-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 1 1999", "title": "Electrochemical behaviors of a V-Ni amorphous binary alloy", "abstract": "A novel V-Ni amorphous binary alloy prepared by ball-milling was characterized with electrochemistry and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The alloy was found to exhibit a good activation property and a durable cycling stability. It was attributed to the amorphous structure of the alloy with a high defect density and the extra energy accumulating during mechanical alloying. In the present paper, the dissolution of V on the cyclic stability of V-Ni alloy was first studied. In the present experiment the V-Ni amorphous alloy shows no capacity decay even after 50 cycles, and the capacity decay for the V-Ti-Ni ahoy is mainly due to the formation of a TiO2 layer instead of the dissolution of V. The effect of the structural features of the amorphous alloys on the capacity of the alloy was studied next. The discharge capacity is found to be contributed to mainly the protons stored in the V, and V3Ni tetrahedral interstices. By using a constant current discharge technique, the average hydrogen diffusion coefficient in the amorphous solid solution is determined to be 3.77x10(-11) cm(2) s(-1), and is a function of the state of the charge in the V-Ni alloy.

were prepared via the EEW (electric explosion of wire) method. However, due to the formation of chromium oxide (CrO0.87) and/or vanadium oxide (V16O3) during the explosion, the exploded particles were deficient in Cr and V content, contrary to the anticipated composition, and micro-particles also formed in addition to the nano-particles. The hydrogen storage capacity of the exploded particles decreased compared to that of mechanically crushed particles from ingots, because the number of interstitial sites for hydrogen in the lattice was reduced due to the increased surface area and also because the BCC phase decreased as a result of the formation of oxide phases. As the lattice parameters of the alloys became small, the plateau pressure in the P-C isotherm increased because it was more difficult for hydrogen to diffuse through the lattice. It was also found that the strain induced by adding other elements in the V lattice reduced the hysteresis in the P-C isotherm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While the mean diameter of the metal V NPs was 8.4 nm in the as-implanted state, the diameters steeply increased during oxidation, with some exceeding 100 nm. Since at least 15 different composition phases, such as V2O3, V3O7, V6O13, V9O17, etc., are known for vanadium oxides, identification of the oxide phase of the NPs was not easy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was not a powerful tool for phase identification of the NPs, because the diffraction peaks were broad due to the nanometric sizes of the particles and readily shift due to stress effects. The temperature dependence of the optical absorption spectrum was measured. The observed spectra were almost unchanged between 33 and 370 K. Combining the spectral result and the XRD results, the candidates were narrowed down to three phases, V2O5, V4O9, and V7O13, from the 15 candidates. Among the three, the V2O5 phase is the most probable because the absorption spectrum and the oxygen partial pressure for its formation were both consistent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Besides the above-mentioned phases, probably the X-ray lines of V3O5, V4O7, V5O9, V6O11, V7O13, V4O9, V6O13, V2O5, SnO2, SnO, Sn2O3, Sn3O4 and CuO phases are observed in the X-ray spectra of glass ceramics in the VO2-V2O5-P2O5-Cu2O-SnO2 system. According to SEM/EDS data, these phases were observed as submicrometer fine-crystalline inclusions in glass on the surface of VO2 crystallites and between them. The formation of these phases was caused by the redox processes in the liquid phase during glass ceramics synthesis. The important role of tin oxides possessing high electrical conductivity and vanadium oxides exhibiting a low temperature of metal-semiconductor phase transition in the stabilization of glass ceramics electrical properties related to the phase transition in VO2 has been established.

At ambient pressure, V6O11 manifests a metal to insulator (MI) transition near T-MI = 170 K and V7O13 (the exception in the series that does not become insulating at ambient pressure) manifests an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition with spin density wave character at T-N = 43 K. Temperature-dependent resistivity data for V6O11 and V7O13 were measured under pressures up to 7.52 and 6.40 GPa, respectively with critical pressures of P-c(MI) = 3.8 GPa for V6O11 and P-c(AFM) = 3.5 GPa for V7O13. As the MI transition for V6O11 is suppressed no features associated with an AFM transition in the resistivity are seen. Near the critical pressure for V6O11 where the first-order MI transition disappears, a T-2 dependence of the low-temperature resistance can be found. On the other hand, in V7O13 as the second-order, antiferromagnetic transition is brought towards T = 0, the resistivity shows a vanishing low-temperature region of Fermi-liquid-like behavior, consistent with proximity to a quantum critical point. Improved hydrostaticity of the pressurized sample space enhances the divergence of the T-2 coefficient for V7O13 near the AFM critical pressure, 3.5 GPa.

Adhesion forces were determined by analysis of pull-off forces obtained from force-distance curves with atomic force microscopy in ultrahigh vacuum, on clean surfaces and with defined contact conditions. The investigated samples include (i) different stoichiometries of Magneli-type vanadium oxides (V3O5, V4O7, V6O11, and V7O13), which undergo metal-insulator-transitions as a function of temperature, (ii) the (0001) basal plane and the (10-10) prism plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which differ in their respective perpendicular-plane electrical conductivities by several orders of magnitude, and (iii) the (100) surfaces of pure metal single crystals, i.e., silver (Ag), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and gold (Au). It is shown, that the vanadium oxides as well as the graphite exhibit significantly lower adhesion forces in their electrical conductive state than in their non-electrical conductive state. The values obtained for the electrical conductive states are quantitatively confirmed by the measurements on the single crystal metals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since one can expect dynamic rearrangement of implanted species and a distorted lattice due to implantation, we investigated the precipitation process under ion implantation at high temperature. Sapphire samples were implanted with 300-keV V+ ions at temperatures from 470 to 1070 K in a transmission electron microscope interfaced with ion accelerators. Evolution of vanadium oxide precipitates was observed simultaneously. Damage evolution such as dislocation loops and voids were observed at fluences of the order of 10(18)-10(19) and 10(20) ions/m(2), respectively. At implantation fluence of the order of 10(21) ions/m(2) dot and plate contrast was observed in addition to radiation damage. Electron diffraction analysis reveals that hexagonal and monoclinic V2O3, tetragonal and monoclinic VO2, and V7O13 precipitates were formed in the substrate depending on the surface normal of the substrate. Some of precipitates were thermally unstable phases. Crystallographic relationship between matrix and the precipitates was investigated as well as the swelling effect both in the substrate and in the precipitates.
