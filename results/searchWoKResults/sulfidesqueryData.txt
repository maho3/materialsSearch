In Ce2Fe1.82S5, vacancies occur exclusively in the octahedral iron sites. The \"tetrahedral\" iron sites are split into three closely spaced partially occupied positions with coordination numbers of [4 + 1]. The presence of vacancies entails the partial oxidation of one of the cations to compensate the charge. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of the Ce M-IV,M-V edge of Ce2Fe1.82S5 showed no evidence of the occurrence of tetravalent cerium. The presence of Fe3+ was unambiguously established on the basis of hyperfine fields observed in a Fe-57-Mobetabauer spectrum at 4.2 K. The temperature dependence of the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility (chi(-1)) of Ce2Fe1.82S5 is nearly linear at higher temperatures. A rapid decrease in chi(-1) below approximately 90 K suggests a ferrimagnefic transition.\n\n(C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

SELENIUM LEVELS IN PYRITE - COMPARISON WITH DELTA-S-34 VALUES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SOURCE OF SULFUR IN VOLCANOGENIC HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "Part I. Pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite from six volcanic-hosted massive sufide (Mount Chalmers, Rosebery, Waterloo, Agincourt, Dry River South, and Balcooma) deposits in eastern Australia were analyzed using a proton microprobe to determine trace element abundances. In pyrite, trace elements can be divided into three groups according to the most likely occurrence of the element: (1) elements that occur mainly as inclusions (Cu, Zn, Pb, Pa, Pi, Ag, and Sb), (2) elements that occur as nonstoichiometric substitutions in the lattice (As, Tl, Au, and possibly Mo), and (3) elements that occur as stoichiometric substitutions for Fe (Go and Ni) or S (Se and Te). Hydrothermal and metamorphic recrystallization cleans pyrite of group 1 and group 2 elements, but does not appear to affect the concentrations of group 3 elements. Colloform pyrite grains have the highest levels of As and Au (up to 200 ppm), suggesting that rapid precipitation is important in incorporating Au into auriferous pyrite.\n\nElements that occur as inclusions in chalcopyrite include Pb, Pi, Zn (?), and Ba. The occurrence of As and Sb is unresolved, although consistently high values of As in some samples suggest that As may substitute into the lattice of chalcopyrite. Elements that substitute into the lattice include Ag (for Cu), In, Sn and Zn (?) (for Fe), and Se (for S).\n\nLead, Ba Sb, possibly, and in some cases, Cu, occur commonly as inclusions in sphalerite. Lattice substitutions in sphalerite include Fe, Cd, Cu (to 4,500 ppm), Ni, In, Ag, Te, Ga and possibly Mo. In addition, consistently high (2,000-4,000 ppm) levels of As in the Rosebery barite zone may indicate As lattice substitution.\n\nPart II. The Se content of pyrite in volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposits varies as follows: in Cu-poor, Zn-rich deposits, Se levels are low (mainly <5 ppm) throughout; in Cu-rich deposits, Se levels are highest ; (10-200 ppm) in stringer zones and the lower part of the massive sulfide lens, and decrease toward the top of the massive sulfide lens and into peripheral altered rocks. Metamorphic recrystallization does not affect these variations. Although delta(34)S values also vary systematically in individual deposits, no systematic differences were noted between Cu-rich and Zn-rich deposits.\n\nH2S and H2Se are the dominant aqueous S and Se species in volcanogenic fluids (1 m NaCl 0-2 units acid; Sigma H2S > Sigma SO42-) above 200 degrees C. Under these conditions, pyrite Se levels are governed by FeS2 + 2H(2)Se(aq) double left right arrow FeSe2 + 2H(2)S(aq), and H2Se/H2S approximates Sigma Se/Sigma S. Calculations using available thermodynamic data indicate that at constant H2Se/H2S, pyrite Se levels decrease with increasing temperature.\n\nDifferences observed between Cu-rich and Cu-poor zones cannot be caused by temperature changes. The variations can be best accounted for by differences in Sigma Se/Sigma S of the hydrothermal fluids. Fluids that deposited pyrite in Cu-poor zones had Sigma Se/Sigma S ratios below 1 x 10(-6), which is typical of evolved seawater, with minimal magmatic input (either from magmatic volatiles or from leached volcanic rocks) of Se and S. Fluids that precipitated Cu-rich stringer ore had Sigma Se/Sigma S ratios of 0.05-4 x 10(-4), which is consistent with a significant (>10%) magmatic component.

The spectra of these metal sulfides are interpreted based on qualitative molecular orbital (MO) - energy-band models, and indicate that the metal 3d crystal-field band below the conduction band minimum has significant S 3s- and 3p-like density of states (DOS), because of strong participation of the metal 3d electrons in the bonding of the metals with sulfur.

Such rapid accumulation rates have largely protected the two S1 units from post-depositional oxidation effects and allow a high-resolution investigation of conditions before, during and after S1 formation. The cores are from the Adriatic and Aegean Seas, and both record a simultaneous diminution in intensity of sapropel development at 7500 conventional radiocarbon years that divides both visual S1 units into two approximately equal lobes. Detailed foraminiferal analysis of the Aegean core reveals fluctuations in benthic foraminifera species that indicate anoxic or near-anoxic bottom water conditions during formation of the upper and lower lobes. The central S1 section shows a temporary repopulation by an opportunistic benthic species (G. orbicularis) indicative of improved bottom water oxygen levels. The appearance and disappearance of this species in the central section, and its reappearance just before the end of S1 times, also coincides with increases in abundance of pelagic foraminifera characteristic of cooler surface water conditions, and with local Mn peaks in the sapropel. These features are interpreted as indications of increased deep-water ventilation and bottom water O-2 levels centred during SI time. Although the S1 C-org contents are low at 1-2 wt.% because of dilution by high detrital fluxes, a set of elements (Ba, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, S, Se, U, V and Zn) generally present in other S1 units, older sapropels and black shales is clearly present at enhanced levels. Sulfur enrichment is well correlated with the C-org content throughout SI, and FeS2 formation accounts for the bulk of the: observed S enrichment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The size of the recovered pieces of chimney enabled physical segregation and analysis of distinct chemical zonation within the structures. In particular, large variations in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the different mineralogical zones provide new insight into the processes involved in chimney growth that are not evident from the bulk mineralogy. Systematic zonation of trace and minor elements is strongly influenced by redox conditions, multiple host phases, single or dual fluid source, and the mixing-cooling history of the fluids, even within an individual mineralogical zone. Distinct chemical microenvironments within the chimneys are recognized that provide a basis for detailed reconstruction of the changing conditions in the interiors of the chimneys during their growth. In Finn, 14 discrete chemical microenvironments are recognized in 80 of 90 samples based on high resolution zoning of major and trace elements. Four of the microenvironments are Cu-rich, three are Zn-rich, one is Fe-rich with low Cu, two are Ca-rich, three are SiO(2)-rich, and one is Ba and SiO(2)-rich. In Roane, 24 discrete chemical microenvironments are recognized. Six of the microenvironments are SiO(2)-poor (<1 wt.%) with low SO(4), two have low SiO(2) (1-10 wt.%) and low SO(4), four have low SiO(2) and are SO(4)-free, four have moderate SiO(2), three are SiO(2)-rich, four have low to moderate Ba, and one is Ba-rich. The trace elements Se, Co, In, and Te do not display their typical simple associations with high concentrations of Cu. Variable Se concentrations in the most Cu-rich samples likely reflect variable Se/S ratios of the hydrothermal fluids in response to changing pH, oxidation state or mixing. Co and Te are strongly partitioned into pyrite instead of chalcopyrite indicated by concentrations of these elements remaining high even as the Cu content decreases. Indium also may be present either in chalcopyrite or in Zn sulfides +/- chalcopyrite disease. In Roane, an unexpected correlation between Zn, Cd, Cu and Se is thought to reflect buffering of the fluids to a high pH by ammonia, which increases the saturation temperature of Zn sulfides and caused codeposition of Cu and Zn, with Cd enriched in Zn sulfides and Se enriched in Cu sulfides. The notable Ag enrichment in the Cu-rich samples from Finn are distinct from East Pacific Rise black smokers, possibly due to the lower temperatures (similar to 300 degrees C vs. >= 350 degrees C) and higher fluid pH. Lower temperature assemblages in both Finn and Roane are enriched in Sb, TI, Hg, Pb, +/- Au, and +/- Ag. Arsenic is enriched in some low-temperature zones but is most strongly correlated with Mo in pyrite; both elements are also absorbed from seawater as oxyanions. Uranium and V are also interpreted to have a seawater source and both may be present in clay minerals, together with the alkalies (Na, K. Rb, and Cs) while U may also be associated with sulfate minerals. Variable enrichments of Al(2)O(3), U, and V in the silica-rich microenvironments within Finn and Roane indicate either seawater-hydrothermal fluid mixing or conductive cooling of hydrothermal fluid as the main process precipitating the silica.\n\nThese findingshave implications for the range of possible microbial habitats that may develop within chimney structures during their growth, which may include highly variable redox gradients and the availability of different nutrients.

The resistivity is nonmetallic for all the compounds in this series. The Neel temperature T-N decreases with x, reaching T-N approximate to 0 by x approximate to 0.2. The susceptibility in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase, which for BaCoS2 is consistent with Co2+ ions in the low-spin S=1/2 state, shows a Curie constant that is very much smaller than expected for Cu1+ and a mixture of Co2+ and Co3+ in the ratio of 1-2x to x. At sufficiently low temperatures there is a spin-glass phase for all x > 0. The magnetic phase diagram obtained is remarkably similar to that of normal state La2-xSrxCuO4 (x <= 0.06).", "ISSN": "1098-0121", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW B", "volume": "73", "authors": ["Schweitzer, JW"], "issue": "10", "pages": "N/A"}, {"DOI": "10.1143/JPSJ.68.3016", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "SEP 1999", "title": "Magnetic and transport properties of electron-doped BaCoS2: Coexistence of antiferromagnetism and metallic conductivity", "DOIlink": "http://journals.jps.jp/doi/abs/10.1143/JPSJ.68.3016", "abstract": "The layered compounds Ba1-xBixCoS2 (0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.7) were prepared in a single phase of the BaCoS2 type.

The crystal flakes have trigonal symmetry with 2c and incommensurate >2(root3)a superlattice ordering in the a-b plane. As-grown flakes showed complex irreversible behaviour in resistivity on cycling to low temperatures, related to the metastability of the structure. The annealing of the crystal flakes and addition of 5-10% Al stabilizes the superstructure. We observe an anomalous contribution to the resistance of these crystal flakes with a maximum around 100-150 K. The contribution is more pronounced for better-ordered phases. The magnetic susceptibility and thermopower values of these compounds are large and vary smoothly on cooling around this temperature interval. The polycrystalline phase, obtained at a higher temperature, on the other hand, showed absence of superlattice distortions and gave a smooth behaviour in its resistance, but with a large T-2-contribution.

The reaction of elements above 900 degreesC gives hexagonal phases for large range of x = 0.02-0.5. These are metallic and show enhanced paramagnetism. The reduction of oxides by H2S at a lower temperature of 700 degreesC gives non-stoichiornertic compositions of cubic-V-4 cluster compound GaV4S8. The solubility of Cu-atoms in cubic phase is less than 10% and above x = 0.2 the samples contain a mixture of phases, CuxVS2, GaxVS2 and CuGaS2. The cubic phases are insulating and show Mott's Variable Range Hopping conduction. The non-stoichiomerty and the Cu-substitution reduce the resistivity and thermopower. For x = 0.15 and 0.20, the additional peaks are observed in X-ray patterns. These compositions showed a sharp metal to insulator transition on cooling below 180 K. The transitional behaviour is very similar to that previously reported intercalated VS2 compound AlxVS2. The transport and magnetic properties of these phases are discussed in terms of the clustering interactions among V-atoms and the localisation of carriers on the metallic clusters frequently found in V-chalcogenides.

A rather small value of the ligand-to-metal charge transfer energy Delta(eff) was indicated by the comparison of the experimental Fe 2p XAS spectrum with atomic multiplet calculations, reflecting an almost 1 : 1 admixture of d(5) and d(6)L (L hole on the ligand) character in the ground state for Na5FeS4. The broadening of the main peak toward higher energies when going from Na5FeS4 to KFeS2 is attributed to symmetry lowering from T-d to D-2d. Ligand-field parameterization schemes, such as the angular overlap model, are found to be quantitatively not applicable for the systems under consideration. The phase diagram of d(5) ions and its dependence on the crystal-field splitting (10Dq) acid the ligand-to-metal charge transfer energy (Delta(eff)) are discussed and it is shown that an intermediate spin state (S = 3/2) can become stable for negative Delta(eff) and moderate values of 10Dq and metal-ligand hybridization. This presents another limit for the ligand-field approach and the Tanabe-Sugano diagrams, where only S = 5/2 and S = 1/2 ground states are predicted. For the Fe3+ in a tetrahedral field the theory indicates that it is unlikely that the S = 3/2 and S = 1/2 states become the ground state since the gain in energy due to ligand-ligand coupling and the relatively small charge transfer energy (both tending to lower energetically the S = 3/2 state) are not sufficient to overcome the high exchange stabilization of the high-spin (S = 5/2) state.

The optical spectra and magnetic susceptibility could be consistently interpreted using a S = 1/2 spin ground state for the Fe3+ ion. The features in the optical spectra have been assigned to transitions within the d-electron manifold of the Fe3+ ion, and analysed in the strong field limit of the ligand field theory.

The two structures differ chiefly in the linkage between the two adjacent tetrahedral sheets and the ordering patterns of cations within a tetrahedral sheet. Topologically, the structure of argentopyrite can be obtained by a displacement of a tetrahedral sheet in the cubanite structure along the (a/2 + b/6) direction relative to the sheet beneath, giving rise to a cluster of four edge-shared FeS4 tetrahedra in argentopyrite, as compared to two in cubanite. There are two distinct Fe sites (Fe1 and Fe2) in argentopyrite, rather than only one, as in other MFe2S3 sulfide minerals (M = monovalent cations).

It has been suggested that thapsigargin acts through inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump.  We have directly tested the specificity of thapsigargin on all of the known intracellular-type calcium pumps (referred to as the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase family (SERCA)).  Full-length cDNA clones encoding SERCA1, SERCA2a, SERCA2b, and SERCA3 enzymes were expressed in COS cells, and both calcium uptake and calcium-dependent ATPase activity were assayed in microsomes isolated from them.  Thapsigargin inhibited all of the SERCA isozymes with equal potency.  Furthermore, similar doses of thapsigargin abolished the calcium uptake and ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from fast twitch and cardiac muscle but had no influence on either the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase or Na,K-ATPase.  The interaction of thapsigargin with the SERCA isoforms is rapid, stoichiometric, and essentially irreversible.

We have cloned the mouse homolog of ER beta and mapped the gene, designated Estrb, to the central region of chromosome 12. The cDNA encodes a protein of 485 amino acids that shares, respectively, 97% and 60% identity with the DNA- and ligand-binding domains of mouse (m) ER alpha. Mouse ER beta binds to an inverted repeat spaced by three nucleotides in a gel mobility shift assay and transactivates promoters containing synthetic or natural estrogen response elements in an estradiol (E(2))-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis indicates that mER beta has slightly lower affinity for E(2) [dissociation constant (K-d) = 0.5 nM] when compared with mER alpha (K-d = 0.2 nM). Antiestrogens, including 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), ICI 182,780, and a novel compound, EM-800, inhibit E(2)-dependent transactivation efficiently. However, while OHT displays partial agonistic activity with ER alpha on a basal promoter linked to estrogen response elements in Cos-1 cells, this effect is not observed with mER beta. Cotransfection of mER beta and H-Ras(V12) causes enhanced activation in the presence of E(2). Mutagenesis of a serine residue (position 60), located within a mitogen-activated protein kinase consensus phosphorylation site abolishes the stimulatory effect of Ras, suggesting that the activity of mER beta is also regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Surprisingly, the coactivator SRC-1 up-regulates mER beta transactivation both in the absence and presence of E(2), and in vitro interaction between SRC-1 and the ER beta ligand-binding domain is enhanced by E(2). Moreover, the ligand-independent stimulatory effect of SRC-1 on ER beta transcriptional activity is abolished by ICI 182,780, but not by OHT. Our results demonstrate that while ER beta shares many of the functional characteristics of ER alpha, the molecular mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activity of mER beta may be distinct from those of ER alpha.", "ISSN": "0888-8809", "pub": "MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY", "volume": "11", "authors": ["Tremblay, GB", "Tremblay, A", "Copeland, NG", "Gilbert, DJ", "Jenkins, NA", "Labrie, F", "Giguere, V"], "issue": "3", "pages": "353-365"}, {"DOI": "10.1038/42506", "pdflink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6633/pdf/387620a0.pdf", "pubDate": "JUN 5 1997", "title": "A G-protein-coupled receptor for leukotriene B-4 that mediates chemotaxis", "DOIlink": "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6633/full/387620a0.html", "abstract": "Leukotriene B-4 (LTB4)(1) is a potent chemoattractant that is primarily involved in inflammation, immune responses and host defence against infection(2).

R226 has been expressed in COS-7 and CHO cells and membranes from the transfected cells were screened with adenosine receptor radioligands. R226 could bind the nonselective adenosine agonist tritiated N-ethyladenosine 5'-uronic acid ([H-3]NECA) and A1-selective agonist radioiodinated N6-2-(4-amino-3-iodophenyl)-ethyladenosine ([I-125]APNEA) but not A1-selective antagonists tritiated 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([H-3]DPCPX) and 8-{4-[9{[(2-aminoethyl)amino]carbonyl}methyl)oxy]-phenyl}-1,3-dipropylxanthine ([H-3]XAC) or the A2-selective agonist ligands tritiated 2-[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl]ethylamino 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ([H-3]CGS21680) and radioiodinated 2-[4-({2-[(4-aminophenyl)methylcarbonyl-amino]ethylaminocarbonyl}ethyl)phenyl]ethylamino 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine.

Among several stereoisomers of RA tested, including 7-cis-, 9-cis-, 11-cis-, 13-cis-, and all-trans-RA, only 9-cis-RA effectively competes with 9-cis-[H-3]RA binding to the RXRs. Additionally, the endogenous retinoid trans-didehydro-RA (t-ddRA) does not interact with RXRs, whereas the 9-cis form of ddRA competes effectively. RXRs (alpha, beta, and gamma) bind 9-cis-RA with dissociation constants (K(d)) of 15.7, 18.3, and 14.1 nM, respectively. In contrast to the selectivity of RXRs for 9-cis-RA, RARs bind both t-RA and 9-cis-RA with high affinity, exhibiting K(d) values in the 0.2-0.7 nM range for both ligands. Unlike RARs, the cellular RA binding proteins CRABPI or CRABPII bind t-RA but do not bind 9-cis-RA.

Then, the high-energy and chain-related degrees of freedom are integrated out and we arrive at two, nearest-neighbor, orthogonal, two-center, 8-band Hamiltonians H-8(+) and H-8(-) for respectively the even and odd bands of the bi-layer. Of the 8 orbitals Cu(x)2-(y)2. O2(x), O3(y) and Cu-s have sigma character and Cu-xz, Cu-yz, O2(z), and O3(z) have pi character. The roles of the Cu-s orbital, which has some Cu(3z)2-(1) character, and the four pi orbitais are as follows: Cu-s provides 2nd- and 3rd-nearest-neighbor (t' and t '') intra-plane hopping, as well as hopping between planes (t(perpendicular to)). The pi-orbitals are responsible for bifurcation of the saddle-points for dimpled planes. The 4-sigma-band Hamiltonian is generic for flat CuO2 planes and we use it for analytical studies The k(parallel to)-dependence is expressed as one on u = (cos bk(y) + cos ak(x))/2 and one on nu = (cos bk(y) - cos ak(x))/2. The latter arises solely through the influence of Cu-s. The reduction of the (sigma-Hamiltonian to 3- and 1-band Hamiltonians is explicitly discussed and we point out that, in addition to the hoppings commonly included in many-body calculations, the 3-band Hamiltonian should include hopping between all 2nd-nearest-neighbor oxygens and that the 1-band Hamiltonian should include 3rd-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We calculate the single-particle hopping between the planes of a bi-layer and show that it is generically: t(perpendicular to) (k(parallel to)) approximate to 0.25 eV .nu(2) (1 - 2ut'/t)(-2). The hopping through insulating spacers such as (BaO)Hg(BaO) is an order of magnitude smaller, but seems to have the same k(parallel to)-dependence.

Sequencing of a full-length clone isolated from a rat hippocampal cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1,212 base pairs encoding a 404-residue protein with seven hydrophobic regions predicted to represent transmembrane-spanning domains. Within the transmembrane regions, this receptor was found to be 44-50% identical with various members of the 5-HT1, 5-HT5, and 5-HT6 subfamilies with lower (37-40%) homology to the 5-HT2-like receptors.

Among endogenous biogenic amines, only 5-HT completely inhibited radioligand binding. The inhibition of radioligand binding by other serotonergic agents revealed a pharmacological profile that does not correlate with any previously described serotonin receptor subtype.

We have used a rational design strategy to develop a clotrimazole analog that selectively inhibits IKCa1 without blocking cytochrome P450 enzymes. A screen of 83 triarylmethanes revealed the pharmacophore for channel block to be different from that required for cytochrome P450 inhibition. The \"IKCa1-pharmacophore\" consists of a (2-halogenophenyl)diphenylmethane moiety substituted by an unsubstituted polar pi-electron-rich heterocycle (pyrazole or tetrazole) or a -C=N group, whereas cytochrome P450 inhibition absolutely requires the imidazole ring. A series of pyrazoles, acetonitriles, and tetrazoles were synthesized and found to selectively block IKCa1.

Recently, members of the PSD-95/SAP90 family of synaptic MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) proteins have been shown to interact, via their NH2-terminal PDZ domains, with certain ion channels (NMDA receptors and K+ channels), thereby promoting the clustering of these proteins. Although the function of the NH2-terminal PDZ domains is relatively well characterized, the function of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and the guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain in the COOH-terminal half of PSD-95 has remained obscure. We now report the isolation of a novel synaptic protein, termed GKAP for guanylate kinase-associated protein, that binds directly to the GK domain of the four known members of the mammalian PSD-95 family. GKAP shows a unique domain structure and appears to be a major constituent of the postsynaptic density. GKAP colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with PSD-95 in vivo, and coclusters with PSD-95 and K+ channels/ NMDA receptors in heterologous cells.

CaM kinase IV was strongly inhibited in vitro by KN-62, a specific CaM kinase inhibitor which suppresses Ca2+-dependent transcription of several genes, so we tested whether CaM kinase IV could stimulate transcription. Co-transfection of COS-1 cells by cDNA for CaM kinase IV gave no 3-fold stimulation of a reporter gene expression, whereas co-transfection with CaM kinase II gave no transcriptional stimulation, Since this transcriptional response was mediated by phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), we determined the kinetics and site specificities of CaM kinases IV and II for phosphorylating CREB in vitro. CaM kinases IV and II and cAMP kinase (protein kinase A) all had similar K-m values for CREB (1-5 mu M), but the V-max of CaM kinase IV was 40-fold lower than those of CaM kinase II and protein kinase A. Although all three kinases phosphorylated Ser(133) in CREB, CaM kinase II also gave equal phosphorylation of a second site which was not Ser(98). The two CREB phosphorylation sites were separately P-32-labeled, and the abilities of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2B (calcineurin) to dephosphorylate them were tested. Our results show that all three phosphatases could dephosphorylate both sites, and calcineurin was a stronger catalyst for dephosphorylating site 1 (Ser(133)) than for site 2.\n\nThese results indicate that CaM kinase TV may be important in Ca2+-dependent transcriptional regulation through phosphorylation of Ser(133) in CREB. The fact that CaM kinase II phosphorylates another site in addition to Ser(333) in CREB raises the possibility that this second phosphorylation site may account for the suppressed ability of CaM kinase II to enhance transcription through the CRE/CREB system.

We have examined the effects of 4-week oral administration of three thiazolidinediones (AD-5075, BRL 49653, and CS-045) on plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations in obese hyperglycemic db/db mice. All three agents lower plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations. Normal levels of glucose are achieved after treatment with AD-5075 (>1.7 mg/kg) or BRL 49653 (greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg), whereas CS-045 (100 or 300 mg/kg) produces only modest reductions in either parameter. Although the thiazolidinediones have demonstrated insulin-sensitizing activities both in vivo and in vitro, their primary molecular target has been unclear. We have compared the in vivo antidiabetic actions described above with the in vitro activities on peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). Hamster PPAR gamma 1 was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells to study the binding of [H-3]AD-5075. The concentrations of compounds needed to displace radiolabeled AD-5075 from PPAR gamma correlate with their in vivo potency; the K-i values for displacement by cold AD-5075, BRL 49653, and CS-045 are 22, 68, and 1600 nM, respectively. To examine activation of the receptor, it was transiently cotransfected into COS-1 cells with a reporter plasmid containing two copies of a peroxisome proliferator response element. The EC(50) values for activation are 2, 6, and 140 nM for AD-5075, BRL 49653, and CS-045, respectively. We have also analyzed limited proteolytic digests of in vitro translated hamster PPAR gamma. The thiazolidinediones produce a conformational change in PPAR gamma analogous to those produced by agonists of other nuclear hormone receptors. In the presence of saturating concentrations of either AD-5075 or BRL 49653, a receptor fragment of 27 kDa is protected from proteolysis by trypsin. These data support the conclusion that the antidiabetic actions of the thiazolidinediones are directly mediated through binding to PPAR gamma and the resulting active conformation of the receptor.

A pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson, with a potential of the form V(phi) = LAMBDA4[1 +/- cos(phi/f)], can naturally give rise to an epoch of inflation in the early Universe, if f approximately M(Pl) and LAMBDA approximately M(GUT). Such mass scales arise in particle physics models with a gauge group that becomes strongly interacting at the grand unified theory scale. We work out a specific particle physics example based on the multiple gaugino condensation scenario in superstring theory. We then study the cosmological evolution of and constraints upon these inflation models numerically and analytically. To obtain sufficient inflation with a probability of order 1 and a high enough post-inflation reheat temperature for baryogenesis, we require f greater than or similar to 0.3 M(P1). The primordial density fluctuation spectrum generated by quantum fluctuations in phi is a non-scale-invariant power law P(k) is-proportional-to k(ns), with n(s) congruent-to 1 - (M(P1)2/8pif2) leading to more power on large length scales than the n(s) = 1 Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. (For the reader primarily interested in large-scale structure, the discussion of this topic is presented in Sec. IV and is intended to be nearly self-contained.) We pay special attention to the prospects of using the enhanced power to explain the otherwise puzzling large-scale clustering of galaxies and clusters and their flows. We find that the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model with 0 less than or similar to n(s) less than or similar to  0.6 could in principle explain these data. However, the microwave background anisotropies recently detected by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) imply such low primordial amplitudes for these CDM models (that is, bias factors b8 greater than or similar to 2 for n(s) less than or similar to 0.6) that galaxy formation would occur too late to be viable and the large-scale galaxy velocities would be too small. In fact, combining the COBE results with the requirement of sufficiently early galaxy formation (z(GF) > 2) leads to the constraint n(s) greater than or equal to 0.63, which corresponds to f greater than or similar to  0.3 M(P1) for natural inflation (virtually the same as the sufficient reheating constraint). A comparable bound n(s) greater than or equal to 0.72 arises by combining COBE with the inferred large-scale flows. For other inflation models, such as extended inflation and inflation with exponential potentials, which give rise to initial fluctuation spectra that are power laws through the 3 decades in wavelength probed by large-scale observations, gravity waves can produce a significant fraction of the COBE signal (while they are negligible for natural inflation); for these models, our corresponding COBE constraints on n, are therefore tighter, n, > 0. 76 (from z(GF) > 2) and n(s) > 0.89 (from large-scale flows). Combined with other constraints on the Brans-Dicke parameter (which effectively imply n(s) < 0.77-0.84), this leaves little or no room for most extended inflation models. Chaotic inflation models with power-law potentials have n(s) greater than or equal to 0.95 over observable wavelengths and so are not affected.\n\nAlthough no single value of the spectral index n(s) in the standard cold dark matter model universally fits the data, a value n(s) less-than-or-equal-to 1 may be combined with other variations of the standard CDM framework to explain the large-scale structure. For example, if the baryon density is as high as OMEGA(B) = 0.1 or the Hubble parameter as low as H0 = 40 km/(sec/Mpc), then n(s) approximately 0.7 with CDM would be at least marginally consistent with the large-scale structure data [e.g., the automatic plate measuring (APM) survey angular correlation function], COBE, large-scale velocities, and the requirement of sufficiently early structure formation.", "ISSN": "0556-2821", "pub": "PHYSICAL REVIEW D", "volume": "47", "authors": ["ADAMS, FC", "BOND, JR", "FREESE, K", "FRIEMAN, JA", "OLINTO, AV"], "issue": "2", "pages": "426-455"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "OCT 25 1991", "title": "MOLECULAR-CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF PLATELET-ACTIVATING-FACTOR RECEPTOR FROM HUMAN-LEUKOCYTES", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The cDNA for a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor was cloned from a human leukocyte cDNA library using a 0.8-kilobase pair fragment of the guinea pig lung PAF receptor cDNA (Honda, Z., Nakamura, M., Miki, I., Minami, M., Watanabe, T., Seyama, Y., Okado, H., Toh, H., Ito, K., Miyamoto, T., and Shimizu, T.

The 15-HETE was exclusively of the 15R configuration. The K-m values for arachidonate of native and aspirin-treated hPGHS-2 were about the same suggesting that arachidonate binds to both aspirin-treated and native hPGHS-2 in a similar manner. If, as expected, the formation of 15R-HETE proceeds through abstraction of the 13proS hydrogen from arachidonate, O-2, insertion must occur from the same side as the hydrogen abstraction; with all other lipoxy-genases and cyclooxygenases, O-2 addition is antarafacial. When microsomal hPGHS-2 was incubated with [acetyl-C-14]aspirin, the enzyme was acetylated. An S516A mutant of hPGHS-2, which retains enzyme activity, was not acetylated. This indicates that Ser-516 is the site of aspirin acetylation of PGHS-2; this residue is homologous to the ''active site'' serine of PGHS-1. An S516N mutant of hPGHS-2 was catalytically active; in contrast, an S516Q mutant lacked cyclooxygenase but retained peroxidase activity. Because in the case of PGHS-1 a smaller asparagine substitution is sufficient to eliminate cyclooxygenase activity, we conclude that the active site of PGHS-2 is slightly larger than that of PGHS-1. An S516M mutant of hPGHS-2 was obtained which resembled aspirin-acetylated hPGHS-2 in that this mutant made 15R-HETE as its major product; however, unlike the aspirin-acetylated hPGHS-2, the K-m value of the S516M mutant for arachidonate was 100 times that of native hPGHS-2.", "ISSN": "0021-9258", "pub": "JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY", "volume": "269", "authors": ["LECOMTE, M", "LANEUVILLE, O", "JI, C", "DEWITT, DL", "SMITH, WL"], "issue": "18", "pages": "13207-13215"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "FEB 1991", "title": "MONOMORPHIC AND POLYMORPHIC HUMAN ARYLAMINE N-ACETYLTRANSFERASES - A COMPARISON OF LIVER ISOZYMES AND EXPRESSED PRODUCTS OF 2 CLONED GENES", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "A genetic polymorphism of human liver arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT; EC 2.3.1.5) enzyme activity divides populations into distinguishable \"slow acetylator\" and \"rapid acetylator\" phenotypes.

Moreover, in order to assign as accurately as possible the observed vibrational modes, the effect of the H-D isotopic exchange on the labile hydrogens of sugar and bases has also been studied by recording the NIS spectra of deuterated species. To interpret all the above-mentioned set of experimental data, the harmonic force fields of isolated bases and ribonucleosides have been calculated after full geometry optimisation at the density functional theory level? To test the ability of the theoretical force field to reproduce NIS intensities, first-order spectra of all the above-mentioned molecular compounds have been calculated with the unsealed ab initio force field estimated for isolated molecules. In the spectral region above 900 cm(-1), a satisfactory agreement has been obtained between the calculated and observed NIS spectra of the native molecular species, Below 900 cm(-1), where the vibrational modes arising from the N-H and NH2 wagging modes are located, some discrepancies have however been found on the comparison between the experimental and theoretical results. This disagreement is mainly related to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurring in solid phase in which the labile hydrogens are mainly involved. We have Verified this fact by analysing the NIS spectra of the labile hydrogen deuterated species of bases and ribonucleosides which reveal a better agreement with the theoretical spectra in the spectral region below 900 cm(-1).

In agreement with previous work on the rat NIS, iodide uptake in these cells was initiated within 2 min of the addition of I-131, reaching a plateau after 30 min. Both perchlorate and thiocyanate inhibited iodide uptake in a dose-dependent manner, with inhibition evident at concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mu mol/L, respectively, and reaching complete inhibition at 20 mu mol/L and 500 mu mol/L, respectively.

These spectra were completed by the room temperature Raman and IR spectra from both solid samples and aqueous solutions. NIS spectra are sensitive to the modes in which the hydrogen displacements are involved. The evolution of the vibrational spectra in going from solid phase to solution is discussed. To analyze the structural and vibrational features of an isolated cytosine, we resorted to the quantum mechanical calculations performed at SCF or MP2 levels of theory, with double-zeta form basis sets enlarged or not by adequate polarization functions. The energetically most favorable tautomers, e.g. amino-oxo (a-o) and amino-hydroxy (a-h) forms have been analyzed in this framework. MP2 calculations have shown that the a-h tautomeric form has a lower energy than the well-known a-o form. However, taking into account the small energy difference between the above tautomers, all of them have been considered in assigning the vibrational modes observed in gas phase or in Ar matrix. It turns out that the conformation of the amino group in cytosine deduced from the calculations depends strongly on the extension of the basis functions used. At MP2 level, as soon as the d-polarization functions have been added to the basis sets the NH(2) group prefers a pyramidal conformation. It has been verified that the inversion of the nitrogen located at the top of this pyramid does not correspond to a double minima and that the planar geometry of this chemical group, leading to an overall C(s) symmetry for cytosine, corresponds to a transition state. However, as the calculations show, the preferred amino group pyramid orientation (upward or downward with respect to the cytosine ring) also depends on the extension of the basis sets used. The addition of p-polarization functions on hydrogen orbitals leads to the inversion of the NH(2) orientation. In condensed phase, experimental evidence is in favor of the predominance of the a-o form. In order to assign the vibrational modes observed in the condensed phase, where intermolecular interactions are important, the ab initio force field of the a-o tautomer has been scaled. Although, in many cases this scaling improves the agreement between the experimental and calculated results (wavenumbers and NIS intensities), some crucial problems still exist. Indeed, as has been confirmed by the comparison between the experimental and calculated NIS intensities, the scaled theoretical force field overestimates the coupling between N1-H (or NH(2)) wagging and torsional motions, whereas the coupling between C-H waggings and skeletal torsional motions is largely underestimated. Similar effects have also been observed in the other two pyrimidine bases (Aamouche, A. et al. J Phys. Chem. 1996, 100, 5224; J. Phys. Chem. A 1997, 101, 1808). Recently, it has been shown that an implicit introduction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds by taking into consideration supermolecular models allows to solve partly the above-mentioned problems without a crucial need to scale the molecular force field (Ghomi, M. et al.

The Nernst Ni partition coefficient between olivine and silicate melt (D-Ni) derived from the MORB samples varies between 4 and 9, values that are up to 50% lower than those derived from S-free experimental systems of similar composition. The MORB samples yield lower D-Ni values because Ni2+ and S2- interact to form a Ni-S complex in the silicate melt. Since the Ni present as NiS contributes to the melt concentration but is not available for sequestration by olivine, the overall effect is a reduction in the D-Ni value calculated from the total concentration of Ni in the silicate melt. This hypothesis is supported by the negative correlation between the InKDNi-Mg (K-D(Ni-Mg)=[MgOmelt/MgOOI]/[NiOmelt/NiOOI]) values and the contents of S in the silicate melts of the MORB samples.

X-ray structure determinations of 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 10 revealed that the [M('S2C')I fragments are stereochemically very rigid, being little influenced by the different co-ligands L. The four-coordinate metal centers exhibit an approximately square-planar coordination geometry. The 'S2C'(2) ligands show a characteristic propeller-like twist resulting from positioning the C-6 rings of the 'S2C' unit above and below the coordination plane. As evidenced by the molecular structures of 9 vs. 10, this twist can vary, and the 'S2C'(2-) ligand is flexible enough to accommodate also larger metal ions than Ni-II.

The study focuses on the base of plumes seen on the disk of the Sun with the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. Spectroscopic diagnostic techniques are applied to characterise the plumes in terms of density, temperature, emission measure and element abundance. Attention is drawn to the particular limitations of some of the techniques when applied to plume structures. In particular, we revisit the Widing & Feldman (1992) findings of a plume having a large first ionization potential (FIP) effect of 10, showing that instead the Skylab data are consistent with no FIP effect. We present for the first time CDS-GIS (grazing incidence spectrometer) observations of a plume. These observations have been used to confirm the results obtained from normal incidence (NIS) observations. We find that polar plumes exhibit the same characteristics as the Elephant's Trunk equatorial plume. The most striking characteristic of the plume bases is that they are near-isothermal with a peak emission measure at transition region temperatures similar or equal to8 x 10 5 K. At these temperatures, plumes have averaged densities N-e similar or equal to 1.2 x 10(9) cm(-3), about twice the value of the surrounding coronal hole region. Element abundances in the plumes are found to be close to photospheric, with the exception of neon which appears to be depleted by 0.2 dex relative to oxygen. The absence of a significant FIP effect in plumes is consistent with fast solar wind plasma, although it is not sufficient to prove a link between the two. Finally, we present a comparison between GIS spectra and the SOHO EIT (EUV Imaging Telescope) broad-band images, showing that temperatures derived from the EIT ratio technique are largely overestimated, for plumes and coronal holes. This is partly due to the fact that the so called \"Fe XII 195 Angstrom\" and \"Fe XV 284 Angstrom\" filters are not isothermal, and in coronal holes and plumes lower-temperature lines dominate the EIT signal.", "ISSN": "0004-6361", "pub": "ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS", "volume": "398", "authors": ["Del Zanna, G", "Bromage, BJI", "Mason, HE"], "issue": "2", "pages": "743-761"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00278-1", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703799002781/pdfft?md5=9d217d4a1c31d77473d1456b7e08945a&pid=1-s2.0-S0016703799002781-main.pdf", "pubDate": "JAN 2000", "title": "Fe-Ni exchange between olivine and sulphide liquid: Implications for oxygen barometry in sulphide-saturated magmas", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703799002781", "abstract": "In order to better understand the behaviour of nickel in magmatic processes, we have measured the apparent equilibrium constant (K-D) for the exchange of Fe and Ni between coexisting olivine and sulphide liquid at controlled oxygen and sulphur fugacities (f(O2) = 10(-8)-10(-10) and f(S2) = 10(-2)-10(-4)) over the temperature range 1200 to 1400 degrees C and with 5 to 50 wt.% nickel in the sulphide liquid. Measured values of K-D are independent of temperature and sulphur fugacity, but increase linearly with the nickel content of the sulphide liquid, and follow a power-law increase with oxygen fugacity; behaviour that is consistent with previous measurements of K-D under controlled conditions of f(O2) and f(S2). The variation of K-D with melt nickel content and f(O2) is most likely the result of nonideal mixing in the sulphide liquid, which results in a decrease in gamma(NiS)/gamma(FeS) with melt metal/sulphur ratio. As a consequence of the systematic dependence of K-D on f(O2), a new oxygen barometer is proposed for estimating oxygen fugacity in igneous rocks that were cosaturated in olivine and sulphide liquid.\n\nApplication of the experimental results to natural samples shows that the relatively large variations that exist in K-D values from different olivine + sulphide-saturated rock suites can be interpreted as arising from variations in f(O2) and/or the nickel content of the sulphide liquid. Oxygen fugacities calculated for oceanic basalt samples using the proposed Fe-Ni exchange oxybarometer are found to be relatively high (10(-8.5)- 10(-10.4)) which is in accord with the range of values determined using glass ferric/ferrous ratios. Moreover, the very low f(O2) (similar to 10(-14)) calculated for the mafic dike from Disko Island is consistent with the presence of native iron in these samples and is in quantitative agreement with indicators of f(O2) based on chromite- and olivine-melt partitioning of vanadium. Consideration of the f(O2) exhibited by olivine + sulphide-saturated intrusive suites reveals a range from relatively oxidized (i.e., similar to oceanic basalts) to values at or below that of Disko Island. Field, petrographic, and geochemical evidence suggests that the production of the low f(O2) suite of samples is probably the result of reduction accompanying the assimilation of carbonaceous country rock.

EXAFS data revealed that the structure of the molybdenum sulfide cluster remained virtually intact after ion exchange, However, the incomplete cubane-type structure of the cluster might be lost after thermal treatment at 573 K. The structure of the cluster in Mo3S4/NaY and Mo3S4/KL seems to have changed to the MoS2-like structure through the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction, although a considerably high level of dispersion was kept. Mo3S4 cluster catalysts loaded on NaMOR and KL exhibited a higher level of activity for HDS of benzothiophene than Mo3S4 catalysts loaded on the other zeolites. Benzene was formed through acid-catalyzed dealkylation of ethylbenzene, the primary HDS product. Alkylation of benzothiophene with alkenes derived from the cracking of decane as the solvent also occurred, The acidity seems to be produced through the ion exchange and reduction of cationic clusters during activation. Over HUSY- and NaH beta-supported catalysts benzene was the major HDS product, Nickel incorporation into the Mo3S4 zeolite catalysts remarkably enhanced the HDS activity. Introduction of the Mo3NiS4 core into zeolite as a precursor resulted in catalysts with higher HDS activity than that of Mo3S4 core and Ni2+ independently; it is conceivable that the intimate interaction between nickel and molybdenum in the precursor is effective at producing active species.

Creating useful metal-mediated activation systems often depends on stabilizing the metal with uncommon low oxidation states and low coordination numbers. This provides a redox-active metal center with vacant coordination sites well suited for interacting with small molecules.\n\nMonovalent nickel species, with their d(9) electronic configuration, are moderately strong one-electron reducing agents that are synthetically attractive if they can be isolated. They represent suitable reagents for closing the knowledge gap in nickel-mediated activation of small molecules. Recently, the first strikingly stable dinuclear beta-diketiminate nickel(I) precursor complexes were synthesized, proving to be suitable promoters for small-molecule binding and activation. They have led to many unprecedented nickel complexes bearing activated small molecules in different reduction stages.\n\nIn this Account, we describe selected achievements in the activation of nitrous oxide (N2O), O-2, the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te), and white phosphorus (P-4) through this beta-diketiminatonickel(I) precursor species. We emphasize the reductive activation of O-2, owing to its promise in oxidation processes. The one-electron-reduced O-2 activation product, that is, the corresponding beta-diketiminato-supported Ni-O-2 complex, is a genuine superoxonickel(II) complex, representing an important intermediate in the early stages of O-2 activation. It selectively acts as an oxygen-atom transfer agent, hydrogen-atom scavenger, or both towards exogenous organic substrates to yield oxidation products.\n\nThe one-electron reduction of the superoxonickel(II) moiety was examined by using elemental potassium, beta-diketiminatozinc(II) chloride, and beta-diketiminatoiron(I) complexes, affording the first heterobimetallic complexes featuring a [NiO2M] subunit (M is K, Zn, or Fe). Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the geometric and electronic structures of these complexes were established and their distinctive reactivity, including the unprecedented monooxygenase-like activity of a bis(mu-oxo)nickel-iron complex, was studied. The studies have further led to other heterobimetallic complexes containing a [NiO2M] core, which are useful for understanding the influence of the heterometal on structure-reactivity relationships. The activation of N2O led directly to the hydrogen-atom abstraction product bis(mu-hydroxo)nickel(II) species and prevented isolation of any intermediate. In contrast, the activation of elemental S, Se, and Te with the same nickel(I) reagent furnished activation products with superchalcogenido E-2(-) (E is S, Se, one) and dichalcogenido E-2(2-) ligand in different activation stages. The isolable supersulfidonickel(II) subunit may serve as a versatile building block for the synthesis of heterobimetallic disulfidonickel(II) complexes with a [NiS2M] core.\n\nIn the case of white phosphorus, the P-4 molecule has been coordinated to the nickel(I) center of dinuclea beta-diketiminatonickel(I) precursor complexes; however, the whole P-4 subunit is a weaker electron acceptor than the dichalcogen ligands E-2, thus remaining unreduced. This P-4 binding mode is rare and could open new doors for subsequent functionalization of P-4.\n\nOur advances in understanding how these small molecules are bound to a nickel(I) center and are activated for further transformation offer promise for designing new catalysts.

Estimates of fO(2) based on K-D and sulfide melt composition in natural samples yields a range from fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ)-1 to FMQ-2 or lower, which is in good agreement with previous values determined for oceanic basalts that use glass ferric/ferrous ratios. Anomalously high K, values recorded in some suites, such as Disko Island, probably reflect low fS(2) during sulfide saturation, which is consistent with indications of low fO(2), for those samples. It is concluded that the variation in K-D values from natural samples reflects olivine-sulfide melt equilibrium at conditions within the T-fO(2)-fS(2) range of terrestrial mafic magmas.

It is more difficult to convert tungsten oxides to WS2 than molybdenum oxides to MoS2 and therefore typical sulfidation procedures tend to result in oxysulfidic tungsten phases (WOxSy) next to the layered WS2 phase. The former phase appears to stabilize rather dispersed Ni sulfide particles (NiS-WOxSy) which is found to be a precursor to the 'Ni-W-S' phase: Mossbauer spectroscopy clearly shows that the NiS particles redisperse over the WS2 edges when partly oxidic tungsten phases transform to WS2 slabs. As a consequence of very slow W sulfidation, the Ni promoter ion can end up in two phases, i.e. 'Ni-W-S'-type and in NiS-WOxSy, phases, this in contrast to Co(Ni)Mo catalysts that mainly contain 'Co(Ni)-Mo-S' phases after typical sulfidation procedures. The NiS-WOxSy phase is known to perform well in liquid-phase hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions whereas the 'Ni-W-S' phase is most active for gas-phase HDS. The relative speciation of these two phases for alumina-supported NiW can be controlled by parameters as the calcination temperature and the sulfidation temperature and pressure. Notably, elevated sulfidation pressures are preferred over elevated sulfidation temperatures because in the latter case the WS2 slabs tend to sinter and crystallize which negatively affects the performance. This work shows the existence of a strong support effect for carbon- and alumina-supported NiW. Similar trends were found for amorphous-silica-alumina-supported NiW which is consistent with the finding that the sulfidation mechanism is similar to that of NiW/Al2O3.\n\nEven when WS2 sulfidation is completed, as for instance found for a carbon-supported NiW catalyst at 673 K, a significant fraction of Ni is not involved in the 'Ni-W-S' phase. Chelating agents improve the edge occupation in NiW catalysts significantly by retarding Ni sulfidation. The result is a more efficient formation of the 'Ni-W-S' phase and optimized catalysts have a significantly higher activity than conventional ones. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The efficacy of I-131-iodide for NIS-expressing tumor therapy may be limited by a combination of poor cellular retention and unfavorable physical characteristics (long physical half-life and low linear-energy-transfer [LET] radiative emissions). On the other hand, At-211-astatide is also transported by NIS and offers several therapeutic advantages over I-131-iodide due to its physical characteristics (short half-life, high LET a-particle emissions). The objective of this study was to directly compare the radiotoxicity of both radionuclides using a NIS-transfected cultured cell model. Methods: Cytotoxicity was determined by colony-forming assays. Also, a first-order pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate the closed compartmental system between the medium and cells. Experimental data were then fitted to this model and used to estimate the transfer coefficients between medium and cells, k(m)(c), and between cells and medium, k(c)(m). Using the pharmacokinetic model, the cumulated activity concentrations in the medium and cells were calculated. Monte Carlo transport methods were then used to assess absorbed doses from I-131 and At-211. Results: At-211-Astatide was significantly more cytotoxic than I-131-iodide in this closed compartmental system. For At-211-astatide, absorbed doses per unit administered activity were 54- to 65-fold higher than for I-131-iodide. Both NIS-expressing and control cells showed increased sensitivity to At-211 over 1311, with significantly lower D-0 (absorbed dose required to reduce the survival fraction to e(-1)) and SF2 (2-Gy survival fraction) values, highlighting the higher intrinsic cytotoxicity of a-particles. However, NIS-independent (nonspecific) binding of At-211-astatide was higher than that of I-131-iodide, therefore, yielding a lower absorbed dose ratio between NIS-transfected and -nontransfected cells. Conclusion: Treatment of NIS-expressing cells with At-211-astatide resulted in higher absorbed doses and increased cytotoxicity per unit administered activity than that observed with I-131-iodide.

Mo L-II-edge and M-III-edge NEXAFS spectra indicate that on reaction with H2S, the Mo component of NiMoO4 gets partially reduced with the formation of MoS2 type species. For the beta-phase of NiMoO4, the sulfidation of Mo is more extensive than for the ct-phase, making the former a better precursor for catalysts of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reactions. The Ni Lu-edge features are relatively insensitive to the changes accompanying the partial sulfidation of NiMoO4. The sulfidation of the Ni component is confirmed by analysis of the Ni K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra which show the formation of Ni-S bonds (bond length similar to 2.48 Angstrom) and a NiMoSx phase. The S K-edge NEXAFS spectra show the presence of at least two types of sulfur species, one associated with a formal oxidation state of 2- and another associated with a formal oxidation state of 6+. We attribute the former to the presence of metal-sulfur bonds (MoSx and NiSy). The latter is associated with the formation of S-O bonds (SO42-). The formation of sulfates is also supported by the O K-edge NEXAFS spectra.

In metastable NiS with the B8(1) structure, for example, this cross-over manifests itself as a first-order expansion of the c-axis on cooling from a Pauli-paramagnetic metallic phase to an antiferromagnetic phase at a Neel temperature T-N = 264 K. A first-order lattice expansion also occurs in the perovskite NdNiO3 on cooling from a metallic to an insulating phase, but in this case the magnetic order below T-N indicates a segregation into ferromagnetic Ni-O-Ni (111) sheets containing itinerant electrons that are coupled by ionic bonding across an oxide-ion (111) plane to give a charge-density wave (CDW) with a propagation vector q(CDW) [111] and a spin-density wave (SDW) with q(SDW) approximate to 2q(CDW). In rhombohedral FeS, itinerant minority-spin electrons co-exist with localized majority-spin electrons into molecular orbitals. A low-spin to intermediate-spin transition in LaCoO3, occurs via short-range ordering of low-spin and high-spin to intermediate-spin trivalent cobalt, localized e electrons at the high-spin cobalt transforming to itinerant sigma* electrons in the intermediate spin state.

In this work, the literature tetrahedral Ni[R2P(S)NP(S)R-2](2) complexes, R = Ph ((NiL2)-L-Ph,Ph, 1(Td)) and R = Pr-i ((NiL2)-L-iPr,iPr, 2) as well as the newly synthesized Ni[R2P(S)NP(S)Ph-2](2) complex ((NiL2)-L-iPr,Ph, 3), have been studied by UV-vis, IR, and P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Complex 3 was shown by X-ray crystallography to be square planar, and magnetic studies confirmed that it is diamagnetic in the solid state. However, it becomes paramagnetic in solution, as it shows a similar UV-vis spectrum to one of the tetrahedral 1(Td) and 2 complexes. The crystal structure of the potassium salt of the asymmetric ligand, [(Pr2P)-Pr-i(S)NP(S)Ph-2]K, has also been determined and compared to those of the protonated (Pr2P)-Pr-i(S)NHP(S)Ph-2 ligand and complex 3. All three, 1(Td), 2, and 3, (NiL2)-L-R,R' complexes show strong paramagnetic effects in their solution P-31 NMR spectra. The magnetic properties of paramagnetic complexes 1 and 2 in the solid state were investigated on oriented crystals, and their analysis afforded remarkably small values of the spin-orbit coupling constant (lambda) and orbital reduction factor (kappa) parameters, implying significant delocalization of unpaired electronic density toward the ligands. The above experimental findings are combined with data from standard density functional theory and correlated multiconfiguration ab initio theoretical methods, in an effort to investigate the interplay between the square planar and tetrahedral geometries of the NiS4 core, the mechanistic pathway for the spin-state interconversion, the degree of covalency of the Ni-S bonds, and the distribution of the spin density in this type of system. The analysis provides justification for the structural flexibility of such ligands, affording (NiL2)-L-R,R' complexes with variable metallacycle conformation and NiS4 core geometries. Of particular importance are the large zero-field splitting values estimated by both experimental and theoretical means, which have not, as yet, been verified by direct methods, such as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

On the basis of Hg L(III)-edge EXAFS experiments, we report Hg(II) to form a four-coordinated metacinnabar [beta-HgS(s)] phase when reacted with disordered FeS(s) (mackinawite), at pH 9.0 and a Hg(II) to FeS(s) molar ratio of 0.002-0.012.

Pyrite (FeS2) is a mineral phase often present as inclusions in temperate soils. Moreover, it constitutes an indirect corrosion product of steel, a containment material that is candidate to confine radionuclides in deep geological disposals. The present study was thus initiated to determine the capacity of pyrite to immobilize Sr(II) and Eu(III). An air oxidized pyrite and a freshly acid-washed (non-oxidized) pyrite were used in background electrolytes of varying reducing-oxidizing ability (NaCl, NH3OHCl, and NaClO4) to study the sorption of both cationic species. The sorptive capacity of pyrite appeared directly correlated to the oxidation of the surface. Non-oxidized pyrite had nearly no affinity for the studied cations whereas Sr(II) and Eu(III) species were significantly retained by oxidized pyrite surface. Using the surface complexation theory, sorption mechanisms were modeled with the FITEQL v3.2 and the JCHESs 2.0 codes. Sorption of both Sr and Eu was well fitted, assuming hydroxylated species as the major surface species. This study demonstrates that not only the components of a barrier but also the redox conditions and speciations should be well characterized to predict transport of contaminants in the surrounding of a nuclear wastes disposal.

We used standard palaeobotanical methods and employed propagation phase contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SR mu CT) to create three-dimensional images of the wood and to evaluate its properties. The xylem comprised tracheids and rays, which developed from a cambium. Tracheids possessed an early extinct type of scalariform bordered pitting known as P-type.

The specific hydraulic conductivity of the xylem area was calculated as 8.7 kg m(-1) s(-1) and the mean cell thickness-to-span ratio (t/b)(2) of tracheids was 0.0372.

This atom substitution of Ba2+ by one Sb3+/Bi3+ leads to a magnetic transition from paramagnetic Ba3FeS5 to antiferromagnetic Ba2MFeS5, resulting from an electron-exchange interaction of the iron ions between inter- or intrachains. Magnetic property measurements indicate that the two compounds are both antiferromagnetic materials with Neel temperatures of 13 and 35 K for Ba2SbFeS5 and Ba2BiFeS5, respectively. First-principles electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory show that the two compounds are both indirect-band semiconductors with band gaps of 0.93 and 1.22 eV for Ba2SbFeS5 and Ba2BiFeS5, respectively.", "ISSN": "0020-1669", "pub": "INORGANIC CHEMISTRY", "volume": "50", "authors": ["Geng, L", "Cheng, WD", "Zhang, H", "Lin, CS", "Zhang, WL", "Li, YY", "He, ZZ"], "issue": "6", "pages": "2378-2384"}, {"DOI": "10.1016/j.jssc.2013.12.024", "pdflink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459613006208/pdfft?md5=9a904ee42dbc47d32821c0701fabdee5&pid=1-s2.0-S0022459613006208-main.pdf", "pubDate": "MAR 2014", "title": "Synthesis, crystal structure and electronic properties of the new iron selenide Ba9Fe4Se16", "DOIlink": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459613006208", "abstract": "The new ternary selenide Ba9Fe4Se16 has been synthesized from the reaction of appropriate amounts of elements at high temperature in a silica sealed tube. The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4(1)/a with a=10.0068(3) angstrom and c=35.6415(9) angstrom, Z=4. It is an isostructural compound to the sulfide alpha-Ba9Fe4S15, which is a high temperature polymorph of beta-Ba9Fe4Se15 that belongs to the indefinitely adaptive phases series Ba3Fe1+xS5, 0 <= x <= 1. X-ray powder diffraction and TEM analyses of the synthesized compound were used to determine the phase composition and the structure. The crystal structure can be viewed as overlapping sections along the c axis. Those sections are formed by the coordination polyhedra around barium atoms which can be described as trigonal prisms and bidisphenoids. Within the sections formed by barium polyhedra, isolated pairs of edge sharing FeSe4 tetrahedra are found. Magnetic measurements performed on Ba9Fe4Se16 indicate an antiferromagnetic behavior with Neel temperature of similar to 13 K. Possible influence of air exposure on the magnetic properties is also discussed here. The electric measurements show an insulating behavior below 160 K and the dielectric permittivity and loss tangent at the lowest frequency measured reveal a change of slope very close to T-N. However no magneto dielectric effect was evidenced for magnetic fields of up to 3 T. Activation energy, E-A=0.18 eV, was extracted from the AC conductivity plot in the temperature range of 160-300 K.

The nature and values of the spin exchange parameters deduced from this analysis depend on what spin exchange paths one includes in the spin Hamiltonian. In this article, we review how spin exchange interactions of magnetic solids with localized spins are described on formal, quantitative and qualitative theoretical levels, investigate antisymmetric and anisotropic interactions for general spin dimers, and discuss the spin exchange interactions and magnetic structures of various extended magnetic solids on the basis of spin dimer analysis. Strongly interacting spin exchange paths of a magnetic solid are determined by the overlap between its magnetic orbitals, so that the strongly interacting spin unit of a magnetic solid does not necessarily have the same geometrical feature as does the arrangement of its magnetic ions or spin-carrying molecules. Therefore, in interpreting results of magnetic susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering or Raman scattering measurements, it is essential to employ a set of spin exchange parameters chosen on the basis of proper electronic structure considerations. Spin dimer analyses based on extended Huckel tight binding calculations provide a reliable and expedient means to study the relative strengths of superexchange and super-superexchange spin exchange interactions.

We explore and compare two distinct Wannier schemes, namely the maximally localized Wannier function and the Nth order muffin-tin-orbital methods. Two correlated materials with different degrees of structural and electronic complexity, SrVO3 and BaVS3, are investigated as case studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen here as a test case in view of its simple structure and physical properties.

UPS spectra near the Fermi level of the metallic phase exhibit a power-law dependence on the electron binding energy, indicating that conduction electrons in BaVS3 behave as a Luttinger liquid. The power-law exponent is large ( < approximately 1), indicating that electron-electron interaction is long ranged and possibly that electron-phonon interaction is also important. The spectra exhibit gradual changes with temperature. In particular, a semiconducting gap starts to open well above the metal-to-semiconductor transition temperature and fully develops below it.

Extended Huckel calculations of this compound indicate the band structure near the Fermi level to be composed mostly of d-character orbitals of tetrahedral Ni, and reveal a peak in the density of states slightly below the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity exhibits a local maximum with thermal hysteresis at around 230 K.

The nonstoichiometry is caused by gadolinium vacancies which were detected by a careful microprobe chemical analysis. This layered composite phase is built by alternate stacking of [GdS] and [CrS2] layers along the c axis. The different sublattices ([GdS] and [CrS2]) both have an orthorhombic symmetry. The b parameters (b1 and b2) and c parameters (c1 and c2) of both subsystems are identical whereas the two a parameters have different values (a1 = 5.454(1) angstrom and a2 = 3.451(1) angstrom). The a1/a2 ratio is irrational and determines the incommensurate character of this compound. The complete X-ray structure determination has already been published. Therefore, only the studies of the [GdS] sublattice (a1 = 5.454(1) angstrom, b1 = 5.8098(6) angstrom, c1 = 21.461(4) angstrom; space group Cmca; Z = 8; R = 0.054) and of the projection of the complete structure onto the (b,c) plane (space group: Cmca; R = 0.058) were redone in context with the new results. The results of the chemical analysis were confirmed by this study. The exact chemical formula of the compound is therefore (Gd1.16square30.11S1.27)CrS2. Including the vacancies in the composition leads to an almost exact charge balance between Gd3+, Cr3+, and S2- (1.16 X Gd3+ + Cr3+ = 6.48; 3.27 X S2- = 6.54).

Chromium is the only magnetic element and antiferromagnetic interactions (theta(p) = -390 K) between chromium atoms [d(Cr-Cr)(av) 3.435 Angstrom] are taking place. At low temperatures (T < 80 K), the susceptibility is largely dependent of the cooling mode: ZFC (zero field cooled) and FC (field cooled). A great number of measurements were performed: magnetization, thermo- and isothermal remanent magnetization, and ac susceptibility on powder and on a single crystal. They all show that LaCrS3 has complex magnetic properties which are reminiscent of spin-glass behavior. These experimental results are discussed in relation with the crystal structure which shows two peculiarities: the (1) chromium framework is a two-dimensional triangular lattice in which antiferromagnetic coupling leads to a topological frustration; and (2) the structural modulation resulting from the mutual interaction between both sublattices (\\LaS\\ and \\CrS2\\) leads to J/k coupling constant values ranging from -60 to -10 K, in relation to the d(Cr-Cr) distribution [3.37 Angstrom < d(Cr-Cr) < 3.48 Angstrom].

They have been characterised by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. An orthorhombic form with Am2m symmetry has been observed. The unit cell contains two layers of NdS and two layers of NbS2. The layers have rectangular symmetry and are stacked alternately with their planes perpendicular to the c-axis. A curious feature of the structure is that the layers have a common b unit cell parameter but the a values, which depend on the metal element in a given layer, are incommensurate. The lattice parameters for the material are a=0.5625 nm for the NdS layer, a=0.331 nm for the NbS2 layer, b=0.5733 MI and c=2.266 nm. The symmetry of the material observed in the present work is Am2m which differs from the Fm2m reported by others. It is argued that the lower symmetry occurs because of a displacement of Nb atoms in one of the layers in the unit cell. A comparison between calculated and observed electron diffraction patterns and energy arguments are used to support the proposed explanation.

Pure similar to LaCrS3 has complex magnetic properties which are reminiscent of spin glass behavior. This magnetic behavior comes from both the modulated character of the structure and the magnetic frustration of the planar-antiferromagnetic-triangular network of Cr3+ ions. Thus, there is a large hysteresis between the zero field cooled and the field cooled magnetic susceptibility curves below the transition temperature ( approximate to 75 K). Formation of a solid solution similar to LaCr1-xTixS3 by the addition of Ti3+ ions results in the decrease of transition temperature up to a doping level of x approximate to 0.5, where the transition is no longer observed. The magnetic behavior of the phase with x approximate to 0.5 is similar to that of several random exchange antiferromagnetic compounds. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The vibrational features of CO adsorbed at the surface of doped aluminas were investigated by IR spectroscopy in comparison with pure parent aluminas, while the quantitative and energetic features were studied by adsorption microcalorimetry. Various CO adspecies were found to form at the surface of both pure and doped-alumina, owing to the structural heterogeneity of the Al2O3 surface and to the presence of alkaline-earth metal cations. The surface heterogeneity was revealed by different nu(CO) stretching frequencies, namely nu(CO) approximate to 2230, 2218 and 2205 cm(-1) for coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Al3+ cations in different crystallographic configurations, and nu(CO) approximate to 2186 and 2172 cm(-1) for coordinatively unsaturated Ca2+ and Ba2+ cations, respectively. Heats of adsorption of approximate to 80, 70 and 55 kJ/mol were assigned to the formation of Al3+/CO complexes, approximate to 45 KJ/mol for Ca2+/CO and approximate to 30 kJ/mol for Ba2+/CO complexes. The latter value was estimated through a correlation curve existing between nu(CO) stretching frequencies and adsorption enthalpies. This correlation, already proposed in the past for CO adsorbed on non-d/d(0)/d(10) metal cations, has been revisited and confirmed here, by including Al2O3 data for which an apparent lack of correlation between the two parameters was first observed. With respect to pure alumina, the population of Lewis acidic sites was found to be significantly depressed by the presence of alkaline-earth cus metal cations. These acidic sites are intrinsically weaker than tetrahedral cus Al3+ cations, as witnessed by smaller upward shifts of the nu(CO) stretching frequencies with respect to CO gas and lower heats of adsorption, in accordance with expectations from the charge/ionic radius ratios. Ca2+ cations were found to compete in adsorbing CO with Al3+ cations more efficiently than the larger Ba2+ cations.

On the base of ab initio band structure calculations and an analysis of various contributions to exchange interactions between Cr spins, we explain this tendency as originating from a competition between antiferromagnetic direct nearest-neighbor d-d exchange and ferromagnetic superexchange via Sulfur p states, which leads to a change of sign of the nearest-neighbor interaction, depending on the radius of an M ion.

Incubation experiments showed that equilibrium times between EDTA and particulate material of 72 h were required to reach equilibrium for most of the metals studied (Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Co, Al, Fe, Pb and Mg). Optimum conditions included a 0.05 M EDTA concentration and the use of an extractant: particulate matter ratio of 200 : 1 (v:w).

The total of 56 patients (17.3%) underwent the first rebiopsy, primarily due to precancerous lesions. The mean prostate volume, ranges of prostate size, PSAT, PSAD and the number of biopsy samples were analysed retrospectively, and the main characteristics in patients with primarily and rebiopsy diagnosed Pca were evaluated as well.\n\nRESULTS: The first biopsy cancer detection rate was 29.6% (112/379). The rebiopsy detection rate was 30.3%.

Main symptoms: headache -16, eye trouble -17, sexual dysfunction -8, growth of acres -5, and others symptoms -8 patients. There were 23 (57,5%) cases of micro adenoma and 17 (42,5 %) macro adenomas. From the total number of patients 23 were operated, 8 micro adenomas and 15 macro adenomas. The number of secreting adenomas was 25 (62,5 %) and 15 (37,5 %) were non-secreting. Secreting adenomas were: prolactinomas--14, acromegalies -7, Cushing syndromes -2, TSH producing -2. Non-secreting adenomas were: craniopharyngeomas--11, meningiomas -2, and 2 non-secreting micro adenomas. Most of prolactinomas were treated with drugs, and 3 cases of prolactinoma were operated. 6 cases of acromegaly were operated and 1 micro adenoma is still under medical supervision, with the therapy of bromocriptine. 3 of those patients have the residuum, and 4 of them have high level of hGH. 11 craniopharyngeomas were operated and all patients, except one, are under substitution therapy. 2 meningiomas were operated and those patients are also under substitution therapy. 1 case of TSH producing tumor was operated, but residuum and hyperthyroidism are still presents, and the micro adenoma, for the hyperplasia reason, disappeared with adequate substitution therapy. The Cushing syndrome, confirmed with MRI diagnostics, wasn't operated; it remained under conservative therapy, and in the other case, where we didn't isolate a pathological substrate, the patient exited.\n\nCONCLUSION: Tumors of the pituitary gland we mainly treat applying surgery methods, together with post operational substitution therapy or additional therapy with drugs.

The logistic regression model was statistically significant, x(2)(7) = 281.530, P<0. 001. The model explained 72.6% of the variance in TPTB and correctly classified 88.1% of cases. Sensitivity was 83.8%, specificity was 91.5%, positive predictive value was 88.7% and negative predictive value was 87.6%. Out of the 7 predictor variables only 5 were statistically significant: cervical length, cervical consistency, rupture of membranes, uterine contractions and amine odor test.\n\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest association between sonographic measurement of cervical length and TPTB.\n", "ISSN": "0353-8109", "pub": "Acta informatica medica : AIM : journal of the Society for Medical Informatics of Bosnia & Herzegovina : casopis Drustva za medicinsku informatiku BiH", "volume": "22", "authors": ["El-Ardat, Mohammad Abou", "Gavrankapetanovic, Fatima", "Abou El-Ardat, Khalil A", "Dekovic, Sanjin", "Murtezic, Senad", "Mehmedbasic, Eldar", "Hiros, Nadja"], "issue": "5", "pages": "306-8"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2014", "title": "Short-term results after local application of steroids and anesthetics in patients with painful spine conditions.", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "\nINTRODUCTION: Spinal pain is the most common of all chronic pain disorders. Imaging studies can be used to determine whether a pathological process is associated with the patient's symptoms.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term efficiency of local instillation of steroids in patients with painful spine conditions.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study included 35 patients with diagnosis of lumbar or cervical radiculopathy, or cervical and lumbar syndrome at the Department for the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Department for the Orthopedics and Traumatology, and Department for the Neurosurgery, Clinical Canter University of Sarajevo (KCUS). A clinical examination, visual pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were performed prior to the needle procedure and seven days after it. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used for comparison of pre and post-interventional results. This procedure was done for the first time in our region.\n\nRESULTS: The males and females were equally represented in this study (17:18). The patients were 29 to 80 years old. The highest number of patients have been between 40-60 years, older then that have been 44.2% of patients, and younger only 8.5%. Patients have complained about the radicular pain along the legs or arms or back or neck pain. Most of them had disc herniation-57.14%, 8.57% had bulging disc, 8.57% had spinal canal stenosis, 5.71% had fasetarthrosis, rest of them had combination of those conditions. There was a statistically significant difference between the value of ODI score before procedure and 7 days later (26 +/- 10:16 +/- 12; p < 0.001). The difference was also statistically significant in VAS values (7 +/- 1:1 +/- 1; p < 0.001).\n\nDISCUSSION: Our study suggests that needle instillation of steroid and lidocaine is effective in short-term pain occurs in different painful spine conditions (Sy cervicale, lumbare and radiculopathy). It is valuable alternative to the classic methods of physical and drug therapy. It can also postpone surgical treatment, and it is very useful in situations of diffuse degenerative changes when is very important to define exact source of pain, like for instance in hip-spine syndrome.\n", "ISSN": "0350-199X", "pub": "Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)", "volume": "68", "authors": ["Hadziahmetovic, Narcisa Vavra", "Aganovic, Damir", "Kadic, Aldijana", "Biscevic, Mirza"], "issue": "2", "pages": "121-3"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2012", "title": "Reibergram and oligoclonal bands in diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "\nINTRODUCTION: In this study authors have analyzed the correlation between the IgG immunoglobulins in cerebrospinal fluid and the findings of oligoclonal bands on gel. Immunoglobulin IgG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be detected in neurological diseasses (infections and inflammatory neurological diseases and in demyelinating diseases, like multiple sclerosis (MS)). Quantitative IgG in CSF can be expressed by different formulae Reiber (Reiber and Felgenhauer 1987), Tourtellotte (Tourtellotte 1970), Schuller (Schuller and Sagar 1983) and IgG Index (Link and Tibbling 1977). In this study we used Reibergram. Qualitative CSF IgG can be measured by electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing (IEF). We used IEF for analysig CSF and seum because of its higher sensitivity.\n\nAIMS OF THE STUDY: To determine the correlation of immunoglobulins IgG positivity in CSF with the finding of oligoclonal bands on the gel.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study based on data processed in OJ Clinical Immunology KCUS. Patients were suspicious of multiple sclerosis according to clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging. All CSF and serum samples were processed by nephelometry, isoelectric focusing on the gel. Statistical analysis of intrathecal synthesis was also performed according to Reibergram.\n\nRESULTS: Analyses were performed on 76 samples of cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients from neurological clinic, suspected of multiple sclerosis. We received following results: 42 samples tested had type 1.25 samples tested showed type 2.3 samples had type 3.5 samples had type 4.1 sample had a fifth type. When we compare these results with values obtained by intrathecal synthesis of which is determined by Reibergram we obtained the following values: 16 samples had intrathecal synthesis of 20%-60%, 9 samples had a negative value of intrathecal synthesis of 10% or less.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: For most patients with established MS we found intrathecal humoral response, type two, and the number and arrangement of IgG bands generally does not change during the disease, because they reflect long-term non-specific immune stimulation rather than a specific immune response that during infectious disease changes (quantitatively and qualitatively).\n", "ISSN": "0350-199X", "pub": "Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)", "volume": "66", "authors": ["Karamehic, Jasenko", "Delic-Sarac, Marina", "Subasic, Djemo", "Jukic, Tomica", "Coric, Jozo", "Panjeta, Mirsad", "Drace, Zahida", "Zecevic, Lamija", "Mutevelic, Selma", "Dzananovic, Nejra", "Grcic, Nerima", "Kesmer, Amila"], "issue": "4", "pages": "222-5"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "WIN 2011", "title": "How to And Answers Within Your Company", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "The challenge of locating internal knowledge on specialized topics exists within any large organization. One way an organization can address this challenge is through an internal knowledge market, which is typically an IT-supported platform within an organization that matches knowledge seekers with knowledge sources and that includes material or social incentives to encourage information sharing. Early adopters such as Infosys Technologies, Siemens, McKinsey & Co. and Eli Lilly have demonstrated the value of internal knowledge markets for managing information flows within an organization. However, there have been challenges and complications in implementing internal markets. Based on an analysis of more than 50 implementations of various types of internal markets, as well as underlying economic theory, the authors provide guidance on how to design, launch and sustain internal knowledge markets.\n\nThe authors recommend using material and social incentives to encourage employees to participate in the knowledge market, but allowing the prices for knowledge to float. One approach is a \"virtual currency\"; for example, Infosys introduced a virtual currency known as \"knowledge currency units\" in its internal knowledge market; KCUs earned in the internal knowledge market can be redeemed for cash and prizes. The authors also advise that executives organizing an internal knowledge market seed the market with high-value content and then subsidize community development of additional solutions.\n\nWhen setting up internal knowledge markets, executive leadership should function less like a central planner than like a market maker or Federal Reserve, the authors argue. For example, in a well-designed internal knowledge market, gradually issuing additional virtual currency points to market participants should help grow the knowledge base in the market. To complete a market, participants should have the opportunity to not only acquire points by providing knowledge or answering questions but also to redeem points - whether for services, gift vouchers, answers to their own questions or other claims on company resources.

In our work we have shown patients treated on The Clinical for Anesthesia and Intensive care from first January to thirty one June 2006. In the same time patients had hospital treatment and rehabilitation. All the patients were analyzed according to gender, age, the etiology of illness, the duration of rehabilitation and rehabilitation outcome at the time of their admission and at the time of their dismissal assumed by ET test. During six months we treated and rehabilitated 140 patients on The Clinic for Anesthesia and Intesive Care. We had 51% men and 49% women. When we analyzed the age we have seen that until 20 years we had 6.7% patients, 21-30 years 6% patients, 31-40 years 7.5% patients, 41-50 years had 20%, 51-60 years 23.3% patients, 61-70 years 24% patients, 71-80 years 9.2% patients and more than 81 years only 3.3% patients. Most of the examinees had acute cholecystitis 15.8% and ileus 12.5% patients. When we analyzed time for rehabilitation the most examinees 24.5% had only 2 days treatment. More than 15 days treatment had only 12.5% patients. All examinees had kinezitherapy. The rehabilitation outcomes demonstrated by ET- test showed increase from 90-120 at time of admission with 36% patients to the interval 160-200 with 30% at the time of discharge. This results showed excellent results of early rehabilitation after injuries or operative treatments. Therefore we can conclude that rehabilitation has to start as soon as possible after injuries or disease. It is the way how to prevent late complications and make the rehabilitation more successful, complete and shorter.\n", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "Medicinski arhiv", "volume": "62", "authors": ["Tanovic, Edina", "Tanovic, Haris", "Hajro, Tarik"], "issue": "1", "pages": "38-40"}, {"DOI": "N/A", "pdflink": "N/A", "pubDate": "2006", "title": "A Comparison of Obesity Prevalence between Korean-American Children and Korean Children", "DOIlink": "N/A", "abstract": "This study is to compare the prevalence of obesity between Korean-American children and Korean children, and to investigate the role of environmental factors in obesity development.

Morbidity is about 16% of total morbidity carcinoma digestive system. Early discovery is relatively tough and resection in comparison to discovered cases amounts only 2-5% cases, and in the last period it increased from 10-15%. According to the data of different authors, localization of tumor in the head of pancreas is between 70% and 84% cases. Two times is more often on the male individuals. When we are talking about contraindications of cephalic duodenopankreatectomy in each case absolute contraindication is considered present of liver metastasis and carcinoma peritoneuma. Most of the authors, mainly, present general contraindications such as: resection of lazier, ascit and general condition of patient. Contraindication for the operation is extended ikterus with albminima below 30 g/l. This type of exam shows serious damage of the function of liver. Elison and sur in 1984 noticed that preoperative bilijarna decompresy can decrease postoperative mortality up to 30%, which refers to all operations as well as palliative and radical. Older patients (above 70 years) with pre-comatose or comatose conditions and the patients with the size of the tumor of head pancreas above 1.5 cm, as well as patients with infiltration of veins mesenteric or ports are considered inoperative since resection of large blood veins as well as total pankreatektomia is not prolonging life of patient. Mortality on the cephalic duodenopankreatectomy is oscillating and in the literature data it is found from 10%, and above 30% and in high specialized institutions about 5% or even 0%. According to the statement of the clinic Mayo in 89 cases surviving above five years has been less then 5% and average survival was 1.03 years. Hower is mentioning that five year survival in USD amounts about three pro mile. In our subject we have analyzed operated cases in one year. For the whole year it was operated 14 patients. Considering the number of citizens which are treated at KCUS, it is higher number from the statistics found in the literature. Only one patient had bilirubin, which was within normal limits, while all other patients were operated with increased value of bilirubin. Albumins below 30 g/l were present on the four patients. Ten patients had the size of tumor above 2 cm. One patient after post operation died which amounts to 7, 14% cases and coincides with the facts from the literature. In the conclusion indication for the radical operative treatment of tumor of head pancreas are expanding and operative mortality is decreasing.\n", "ISSN": "N/A", "pub": "Medicinski arhiv", "volume": "60", "authors": ["Tanovic, Haris", "Juricic, Ratko", "Aksamija, Goran", "Sabanovic, Jusuf", "Muhovic, Samir", "Mulabdic, Adi"], "issue": "6 Suppl 1", "pages": "34-6"}]]]
